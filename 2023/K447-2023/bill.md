  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 14, 2023, as IgA Nephropathy  Awareness  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 14, 2023, as IgA
Nephropathy Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, 20 years ago, Bonnie Schneider founded the IgA  Nephropathy
Foundation  after her son's diagnosis to create a support hub for people
living with IgA Nephropathy; and
 
  WHEREAS, IgA  Nephropathy  (IgAN)  is  an  autoimmune  disease  that
attacks the kidneys and affects how blood is filtered in the small blood
vessels of the kidneys; IgAN occurs when an abnormal protein damages the
filtering unit, the glomerulus, inside the kidneys; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  estimated  that 20-40% of the people who have IgAN
will develop end-stage  kidney  disease,  which  means  they  will  need
dialysis or a kidney transplantation to survive; and
 
  WHEREAS, IgA Nephropathy Awareness Day is meant to bring communities
together  to  celebrate  one  another  and  to  raise more awareness for
promoting early diagnosis and treatment of this tragic illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year, May 14, 2023, falls on Mother's Day, and the IgA
Nephropathy Foundation aims  to  celebrate  all  family,  including  the
family  you're  born  with  and  the  family  you find, with a myriad of
special events to raise awareness for IgA Nephropathy; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 14, 2023, as IgA
Nephropathy Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the IgA Nephropathy Foundation.
