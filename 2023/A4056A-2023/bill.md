 AN ACT to amend the  general  business  law,  in  relation  to  creating
  climate  negligence for dangers to safety and health caused by certain
  fossil fuel related activities

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The legislature finds that the consequences of a changing
 climate directly impact New York state. Around the  world  thousands  of
 scientific  studies  have  documented  changes  in air and water temper-
 atures, melting glaciers, diminishing snow  cover,  shrinking  sea  ice,
 rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increasing atmospheric water
 vapor.  Warming  trends  and  incidences  of  intense  heat waves will
 contribute to greater localized heat  stresses;  heavy  rainfall  events
 that  exacerbate  localized  flooding  will  continue  to  impact  food
 production, natural ecosystems, and water resources; and sea-level  rise
 will increasingly threaten sensitive coastal communities and ecosystems.
 Climate  change  is  adversely affecting New York's economic well-being,
 public health, natural resources, and environment.
  To  achieve  the  goals  of  the  Climate  Leadership  and  Community
 Protection  Act (hereinafter the "Climate Act") that include 70% renewa-
 ble electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040,  a  40%
 reduction  in  statewide  GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, an 85%
 reduction in statewide GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2050,  and  net
 zero  emissions  statewide  by  2050,  the New York State Climate Action
 Council (the "Council") determined in its Scoping Plan for  the  Climate
 Act  that  "[i]t  is  imperative  that New York take immediate action to
 aggressively reduce GHG emissions as well as invest in resiliency  meas-
 ures." The cost of not taking immediate and aggressive action, according
 to the Council, is approximately $115 billion dollars.
  The  public health impacts of GHG and co-pollutant emissions are simi-
 larly devastating. Increased heat  stress  (such  as  heat  edema,  heat
 stroke, heat cramps, heat stress, and dehydration) and other heat-relat-
 ed  morbidity  and  mortality;  exacerbation  of  respiratory conditions

 (including pneumonia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
 and cardiovascular disease; increased duration and severity  of  allergy
 symptoms  due  to  increased  duration  and  intensity of pollen season;
 increased  risk  for  vector-borne  diseases (such as Lyme disease, West
 Nile virus, and other pathogens); increased risk  of  injury  and  death
 following  extreme  precipitation  events  and flooding (or, conversely,
 after droughts); rising sea levels  that  threaten  infrastructure;  the
 saltwater  intrusion  of  the  State's  groundwater resources (which may
 impact drinking water supplies); and poor indoor air  quality  (such  as
 mold  and  moisture)  are  just  some  of  those  impacts. Additionally,
 climate-driven impacts are magnified in New York's  historically  margi-
 nalized  communities  that  have been disproportionately affected by and
 are on the front lines of climate change.
  The legislature finds that the New York Constitution grants every  New
 Yorker  the  right  to mitigate these impacts.  Article I, Section 19 of
 the New York State Constitution reads: "Each person shall have  a  right
 to  clean  air  and  water, and a healthful environment." Overwhelmingly
 approved by the voters in 2021, this "green amendment" to our  constitu-
 tion  placed a right to a healthful environment alongside the freedom of
 speech, religion, and property in our Bill of Rights.  As  such,  every
 New  Yorker should have the tools to best utilize that right.  This bill
 seeks to provide them with at least one tool.
  The legislature further finds that the fossil fuel industry has  known
 for decades that their products overwhelmingly contributed to and accel-
 erated climate change, yet they have - and continue to -  lie about this
 fact  to  the public. Documents unveiled by litigation and investigative
 journalists demonstrate that as early as the 1950s, the industry  became
 aware of the potentially catastrophic impact of its products and even in
 the  face  of  scientific  consensus  shortly  thereafter  and  research
 conducted by their own scientists affirming the impacts of  their  busi-
 ness,  the industry outright denied that climate change was real, spread
 disinformation to cast doubt on the science, dismissed regulatory action
 as insufficient (after no longer  being  able  to  deny  climate  change
 outright),  and  currently  advertise "green" efforts to the public that
 mask the industry's lack of real investment in  resiliency  and  energy-
 source  transition. A December 2022 report by the Oversight Committee in
 Congress also revealed internal documents from  senior  leaders  in  the
 industry  where,  among  other  things,  they  explicitly  reject taking
 accountability for the emissions of their products.
  By conduct and impact, the industry has intentionally  obfuscated  the
 truth  about climate change and outright deceived the public in order to
 continue dependence on their products. The legislature finds  that  this
 conduct and the subsequent impact on the public is not political speech,
 but  fundamentally commercial activity with incidental political impact.
 We also find this conduct to be a substantial factor  in  affecting  the
 public's  perception of the threat of climate change, scientific consen-
 sus notwithstanding.
  New Yorkers should have the ability  to  hold  those  responsible  for
 climate  change  accountable for their deceptive practices and the cata-
 clysmic impacts these practices have yielded. This bill seeks to provide
 them with that opportunity.
