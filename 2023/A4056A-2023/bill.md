 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  general  business  law, in relation to creating
  climate liability for dangers to safety and health caused  by  certain
  fossil fuel related activities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The legislature finds that the consequences of  a  changing
 climate  directly  impact  New York state. Around the world thousands of
 scientific studies have documented changes  in  air  and  water  temper-
 atures,  melting  glaciers,  diminishing  snow cover, shrinking sea ice,
 rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increasing atmospheric water
 vapor.  Warming trends  and  incidences  of  intense  heat  waves  will
 contribute  to  greater  localized  heat stresses; heavy rainfall events
 that  exacerbate  localized  flooding  will  continue  to  impact  food
 production,  natural ecosystems, and water resources; and sea-level rise
 will increasingly threaten sensitive coastal communities and ecosystems.
 Climate change is adversely affecting New  York's  economic  well-being,
 public health, natural resources, and environment.
  To  achieve  the  goals  of  the  Climate  Leadership  and  Community
 Protection Act (hereinafter the "Climate Act") that include 70%  renewa-
 ble  electricity  by 2030, 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040, a 40%
 reduction in statewide GHG emissions from 1990 levels by  2030,  an  85%
 reduction  in  statewide GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2050, and net
 zero emissions statewide by 2050, the  New  York  State  Climate  Action
 Council  (the  "Council") determined in its Scoping Plan for the Climate
 Act that "[i]t is imperative that New  York  take  immediate  action  to

 aggressively  reduce GHG emissions as well as invest in resiliency meas-
 ures." Although the plan is not  authoritative  on  the  full  scope  of
 damage,  the cost of not taking immediate and aggressive action, accord-
 ing to the Council, is approximately $115 billion dollars.
  The  public health impacts of GHG and co-pollutant emissions are simi-
 larly devastating. Increased heat  stress  (such  as  heat  edema,  heat
 stroke, heat cramps, heat stress, and dehydration) and other heat-relat-
 ed  morbidity  and  mortality;  exacerbation  of  respiratory conditions
 (including pneumonia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
 and cardiovascular disease; increased duration and severity  of  allergy
 symptoms  due  to  increased  duration  and  intensity of pollen season;
 increased risk for vector-borne diseases (such  as  Lyme  disease,  West
 Nile  virus,  and  other  pathogens); increased risk of injury and death
 following extreme precipitation events  and  flooding  (or,  conversely,
 after  droughts);  rising  sea  levels that threaten infrastructure; the
 saltwater intrusion of the  State's  groundwater  resources  (which  may
 impact  drinking  water  supplies); and poor indoor air quality (such as
 mold and  moisture)  are  just  some  of  those  impacts.  Additionally,
 climate-driven  impacts  are magnified in New York's historically margi-
 nalized communities that have been disproportionately  affected  by  and
 are on the front lines of climate change.
  The  legislature finds that the New York Constitution grants every New
 Yorker the right to mitigate these impacts.  Article I, Section  19  of
 the  New  York State Constitution reads: "Each person shall have a right
 to clean air and water, and  a  healthful  environment."  Overwhelmingly
 approved  by the voters in 2021, this "green amendment" to our constitu-
 tion placed a right to a healthful environment alongside the freedom  of
 speech,  religion,  and  property in our Bill of Rights.  As such, every
 New Yorker should have the tools to best utilize that right.  This  bill
 seeks to provide them with at least one tool.
  The  legislature also finds that there has been a scientific consensus
 for several decades that climate change is occurring exemplified by  the
 testimony  of  Dr.  James  Hansen  of the National Aeronautics and Space
 Administration in June 1988 to the U.S. Senate and the  formation  later
 that  year  of  the  United  Nations  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
 Change.
  The legislature further finds that the fossil fuel industry has  known
 for decades that their products overwhelmingly contributed to and accel-
 erated climate change, yet they have - and continue to -  lie about this
 fact  to  the public. Documents unveiled by litigation and investigative
 journalists demonstrate that as early as the 1950s, the industry  became
 aware of the potentially catastrophic impact of its products and even in
 the  face  of  scientific  consensus  shortly  thereafter  and  research
 conducted by their own scientists affirming the impacts of  their  busi-
 ness,  the industry outright denied that climate change was real, spread
 disinformation to cast doubt on the science, dismissed regulatory action
 as insufficient (after no longer  being  able  to  deny  climate  change
 outright),  and  currently  advertise "green" efforts to the public that
 mask the industry's lack of real investment in  resiliency  and  energy-
 source  transition. A December 2022 report by the Oversight Committee in
 Congress also revealed internal documents from  senior  leaders  in  the
 industry  where,  among  other  things,  they  explicitly  reject taking
 accountability for the emissions of their products.
  By conduct and impact, the industry has intentionally  obfuscated  the
 truth  about climate change and outright deceived the public in order to
 continue dependence on their products. The legislature finds  that  this
 A. 4056--A  3

 conduct and the subsequent impact on the public is not political speech,
 but  fundamentally commercial activity with incidental political impact.
 We also find this conduct to be a substantial factor  in  affecting  the
 public's  perception of the threat of climate change, scientific consen-
 sus notwithstanding.
  New Yorkers should have the ability  to  hold  those  responsible  for
 climate  change  accountable for their deceptive practices and the cata-
 clysmic impacts these practices have yielded. This bill seeks to provide
 them with that opportunity.
