  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law to  the  contrary,  Christine
 Fernandez,  formerly  Christine  Lennard, a member of the New York state
 and local employees' retirement system, who was employed part-time  with
 the  Voorheesville  public  library beginning in September, 1984 through
 August, 1985 and who is currently  employed  with  the  New  York  State
 Police,  who  through  no  fault  of her own was not given the option to
 become a member of the New York state and  local  employees'  retirement
 system  in 1984 when first employed by the Voorheesville public library,
 and did not file a membership application in such system until April  2,
 2020 when she began her employment with the New York State Police, which
 gave  her  Tier  VI status instead of Tier IV status, shall be deemed to
 have been a member of the New York state and local employees' retirement
 system on such date she commenced her employment with the  Voorheesville
 public  library in September, 1984, and shall be granted Tier IV status,
 provided that an application is filed with the  head  of  the  New  York
 state  and  local  employees' retirement system within one year from the
 effective date of this  act.  Upon  the  granting  of  such  retroactive
 membership,  Christine  Fernandez  shall  not be granted a refund of any
 employee contribution made by her  to  the  New  York  state  and  local
 employees' retirement system.
  § 2. All past service costs associated with the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by the Voorheesville public library.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6573  2
 
  This  bill  would  grant Tier 4 status in the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System to Christine Fernandez, a  current  Tier  6
 member  employed by the Division of State Police, by changing their date
 of membership to September 1, 1984. There will be no  refund  of  member
 contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $8,800 in the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of Christine Fernandez change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $21,800 which will be
 borne by the Voorheesville Public Library as a  one-time  payment.  This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
