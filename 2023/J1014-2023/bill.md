  COMMEMORATING  the  98th  Anniversary  of  the
  Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
institutions which have  faithfully  served  the  health  needs  of  the
community  and its citizens with diligence and compassionate commitment;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the  98th  Anniversary  of  the  Kingsbrook  Jewish  Medical
Center; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kingsbrook  Jewish  Medical  Center can trace its earliest
origins to the mid-1920s, when the Daughters of Israel -  Home  for  the
Incurables,  a  relief  organization,  elected Max Blumberg, a prominent
businessman, banker, and philanthropist, as their president  on  January
4, 1925; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  June  1925,  Blumberg  proposed  the  development of a
facility  that  would  house  these  ailing  residents;  he  and  the
organization  recognized  there  was  a  considerable  need  for  such a
facility in Brooklyn, and so decided to start an  institution  in  which
such  long-term patients, who could not be cared for adequately in their
homes, might get all the special care and attention they needed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today,  Kingsbrook  Jewish  Medical  Center  has  grown  to
encompass  four  major  clinic  centers,  including  the  Comprehensive
Behavioral Health Center, Bone & Joint Center, Neurosciences  Institute,
and Kingsbrook Rehabilitation Institute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Comprehensive  Behavioral  Health  Center, comprising
Inpatient Psychiatry, Geriatric Psychiatry,  and  Outpatient  Behavioral
Health, specializes in the care and treatment of a variety of behavioral
health issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bone  & Joint Center offers joint replacement, sports
medicine, foot/ankle and  upper  extremity  services,  as  well  as  the
treatment of hip fractures and arthritis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Neurosciences Institute offers comprehensive care for
conditions ranging from brain tumors, aneurysms, and  pituitary  tumors,
to  conditions  of  the spine including spinal tumors, disc herniations,
and spinal fractures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kingsbrook  Rehabilitation  Institute  treats  the  most
complicated  neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, and is home to
Brooklyn's only New York State-approved Brain Injury and  Coma  Recovery
Unit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  located in the East Flatbush neighborhood in
Brooklyn, New York, the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center  is  a  303-bed
 
full-service  community  teaching  hospital  with  an  estimated  2,100
full-time employees; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success of the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center is in
direct correlation to the efforts  of  its  dedicated  doctors,  nurses,
support staff and volunteers, whose involvement is, and always has been,
characterized  by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and
an uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors on  behalf  of
the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Venerable  and  trustworthy  institutions,  tending to the
needs of the community and its citizenry,  represent  the  threads  from
which the fabric of society is woven; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is proud to recognize the benevolent
good works of health care institutions, sharing the pride of its history
and accomplishments, and anticipating its future of continued growth  in
quality and personalized care; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the  98th  Anniversary  of  the  Kingsbrook  Jewish  Medical
Center; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York.
