activities will pay homage to the American Foundation for the University

the noble efforts of the Foundation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Foundation  for  the University of the West

social advancement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  caring  for the community, AFUWI seeks to transform
the lives of exceptionally talented, young women and men who are in dire
financial circumstances by providing access to higher education so  they
can  break the cycle of generational poverty and make an economic impact
in their local communities and throughout the Caribbean region; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the past 10 years, AFUWI has provided  approximately
500  tuition  scholarships  to  students  across  the  Caribbean region,
donated $7.5 million in goods, and brokered multiple relationships  with
other tier one institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success of the American Foundation for the University
of the West Indies is in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its
dedicated  staff  and  volunteers,  whose involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  American  Foundation for the University of the West Indies
upon the occasion of hosting its Caribbean American Heritage celebration
on June 30, 2023; and be it further
