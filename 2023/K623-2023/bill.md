  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of St. Sophia's
  Greek Cultural Festival
 
  WHEREAS,  Fairs  and  festivals  empower  communities to attract new
visitors while capitalizing on local commercial and cultural value; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
support events of significance which contribute to the entertainment and
vitality  of the communities they serve, and which exemplify the history
and development of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of St. Sophia's Greek Orthodox Church's
Greek Cultural Festival; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1917, St. Sophia's Greek Orthodox Church has
grown from a handful of families emigrating from Greece, Asia Minor  and
other  areas  to  a community of approximately 600 families; through the
years, the Church has been housed in three buildings and has been led by
20 different priests; and
 
  WHEREAS, Syracuse's  Festival  of  Nations,  which  began  in  1969,
increased  community  awareness  of  different  ethnicities  and,  by
extension, resulted in greater appreciation of Greek culture in  Central
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  held  from  September  28-30,  1973, the annual St.
Sophia's Greek Cultural Festival is an opportunity for the  congregation
to  share  their  rich  culture  with  others  as  well as help keep the
traditions alive for their children and future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sustained by the love of  their  faith  and  culture,  many
parishioners have worked hard throughout the year to make the festival a
success; as a result of their efforts, it has become the most successful
church  festival  in  the  area,  and people mark their calendars months
ahead to attend this great event; and
 
  WHEREAS, The parish children and young adults practice for countless
hours  to  perfect  their  dances  and  provide  the  much-anticipated
entertainment  which  includes  live  music  and singing, and the parish
priest and some laypeople give tours of the church and explain Orthodoxy
to those who  are  interested;  the  festival  also  gives  visitors  an
opportunity  to  try  a  variety of delicious Greek food, especially the
pastries; and
 
  WHEREAS, An  important  part  of  Central  New  York,  the  four-day
festival  draws  over 10,000 visitors each year who love to dance, sing,
and eat, and simply enjoy life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those  events  which  have  brought  entertainment and cultural
 
enrichment to the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  St.  Sophia's  Greek  Cultural
Festival; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to St.  Sophia's  Greek  Orthodox  Church's  Greek  Cultural
Festival Committee.
