 entire voting strength of the board of education shall be sufficient for
 adoption of such a bond resolution, which bond resolution may be adopted
 at a regular meeting, or a special meeting of  the  board  of  education

 be held either within or outside of such district, (iv)  any  such  bond

 district  capital  facilities  or  school  district  capital  equipment,
 including  debt service and lease expenditures, and transportation capi-
 tal debt service, subject to the approval of the qualified voters  where

 and  regulations  which  may  provide  for  adjustment  of capital local
 expenditures to reflect a school district's share of additional budgeted
 capital  expenditures  made  by  a  board  of  cooperative  educational
 services.]
