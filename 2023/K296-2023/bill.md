  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 10, 2023, as Dyngus Day in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
proclaim April 10, 2023, as Dyngus Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, A Polish-American tradition, Dyngus Day celebrates the  end
of  the  observance  of  Lent  and  the joy of Easter; over the decades,
Dyngus Day has become a holiday to  celebrate  Polish-American  culture,
heritage, and traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  966  A.D.,  Dyngus Day has been associated with the
baptism of Prince Mieszko I; tradition states  that  Prince  Mieszko  I,
along with his court, were baptized on Easter Monday; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dyngus  Day  and  its  rites of sprinkling with water have
become a folk celebration which gives thanks for the fact that the first
king of Poland was baptized into Christianity, bringing  Catholicism  to
Poland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  more  modern  times, the tradition continued when farm
boys in Poland wanted to attract notice from the girls of their  choice;
it  was  customary  to  throw water and hit the girls on their legs with
twigs or pussy willows; and
 
  WHEREAS, The more gallant lads would use cologne instead  of  water,
and  the  ladies  would  reciprocate by throwing dishes & crockery, with
Tuesday being their day of revenge, imitating the same tactics; and
 
  WHEREAS, Buffalo, New York is officially the Dyngus Day  capital  of
America,  hosting the largest concentration of festival locations, polka
bands and Polish traditions in the nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the celebrations in Buffalo, tradition holds  true  that
on  Easter  Monday, boys sprinkle the girls with water and tap them with
pussy willows; on Easter Tuesday, the women would return the  favor;  at
modern Dyngus Day parties, it is common practice that both men and women
trade water and pussy willow taps equally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Annual Dyngus Day Parade in Buffalo's Historic Polonia
District is a demonstration in  civic  and  ethnic  pride;  this  parade
gathers  people  together with a sense of camaraderie and joy mixed with
nostalgia and hope; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Dyngus  Day  Parade  consists  of  floats  resembling
medieval  ships,  fire  trucks  with sirens blazing and hoses squirting,
 
polka bands blaring, and families sharing memories and laughter as  they
stroll  through the neighborhood tossing candy and beads to the families
gathered on the curbs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year's 17th Annual Dyngus Day Parade in Buffalo, New
York, takes place on Monday, April 10th, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The City of  Buffalo  and  its  suburbs  are  home  to  the
greatest concentration of Polish-Americans in the nation, showcasing the
rich cultural heritage and pride that is synonymous with the identity of
America and New York at large; now, therefore be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 10, 2023, as  Dyngus
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of New York.
