  MEMORIALIZING  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023,
  as Motorcycle Safety  and  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness of issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Motorcycle
Safety and Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, motorcycle riders are killed by drivers  who  do
not  see them; greater public awareness must be achieved in an effort to
reduce the numbers of fatalities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Motorcyclists in New York were  involved  in  an  estimated
4,851 traffic crashes in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2022, 163 motorcyclists were killed in traffic crashes
in New York State; furthermore,  fatal  motorcyclist  crashes  represent
about 16% of all motor vehicle deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  number of motorcyclists is increasing yearly; further
education is necessary in an effort to teach riders to become more aware
of safety issues and possible road hazards; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this serious safety issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, state and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  2023,  as  Motorcycle
Safety and Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
