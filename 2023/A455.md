 AN ACT to amend the public service law, in relation to enacting the  "NY
  broadband resiliency, public safety and quality act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "NY broadband resiliency, public safety and quality act".
  §  2.  Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that access to high-speed broadband service is a necessity and essential
 to participation in the economy, education and civic life. Closing  gaps
 in  broadband  availability is a matter of deployment, affordability and
 ensuring networks are resilient,  high  quality  and  facilitate  public
 safety.  Because  voice  over internet protocol has replaced traditional
 voice telephone service for a large segment of the population,  ensuring
 its  reliability  is  in  the public interest and consistent with public
 safety goals. State regulators require unambiguous authority and a clear
 mandate to establish and enforce appropriate oversight and regulation of
 broadband and voice over internet protocol service in order to meet  the
 state's goals of universal, high-quality and affordable access.
  §  3.  The public service law is amended by adding a new article 12 to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 12
  BROADBAND RESILIENCY, PUBLIC SAFETY AND QUALITY ACT
 SECTION 250. DEFINITIONS.
  251. OVERSIGHT OF BROADBAND AND VOIP SERVICE.
