 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the assessor of  the  town  of  Islip,
  county  of  Suffolk,  to accept an application for exemption from real
  property taxes from the East Islip Fire District
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor of the town of Islip, county of Suffolk, is hereby author-
 ized to accept from the East Islip Fire  District,  an  application  for
 exemption  from  real property taxes pursuant to section 464 of the real
 property tax law with respect to a portion of the  2021-2022  assessment
 roll  and  with respect to the entire 2022-2023 assessment roll, for the
 parcel owned by such organization, with such  parcel  being  located  at
 1000  Christopher  Drive,  in  the  hamlet of East Islip, town of Islip,
 county of Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk county  tax  map  district
 0500, section 211.10, block 1.00, lot 006.000.
  If  accepted,  the  application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled to  such
 exemption if such organization had filed an application for exemption by
 the  appropriate taxable status date, the assessor of the town of Islip,
 upon approval by the Islip town board,  may  grant  exemption  from  all
 taxation  and  make appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such
 exemption is granted and such organization therefore shall have paid any
 tax with respect to the subject roll, the applicable governing  body  or
 tax  department  may,  in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 the taxes paid, along with any fines or penalties paid, and  cancel  any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
