  6.  The  denial  of  an  application,  OR  THE DENIAL OF A REQUEST FOR
 REVISION TO AN APPLICATION, for a charter school  by  a  charter  entity
 shall  be  in  writing  and  shall  state  the  reasons  for the denial.
 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the  contrary,  such  denial  is
 final  and shall not be reviewable in any court or by any administrative
 body WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NEW YORK STATE CHARTER SCHOOL  COMMISSION
 ESTABLISHED  PURSUANT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ELEVEN OF THIS
 SECTION.
  (a) A revision of a charter shall be made only upon  the  approval  of
 the  charter  entity  and  the  board  of regents in accordance with the

 ters issued on or after July first, two  thousand  fifteen  and  counted
 toward  the  numerical  limits  established by this subdivision shall be
 issued by the board of regents upon application directly to the board of
 regents  or  on the recommendation of the board of trustees of the state
 university of New York pursuant to a competitive process  in  accordance
 with  subdivision  nine-a of this section. Fifty of such charters issued
 [on or after] BETWEEN July first, two thousand fifteen AND  JULY  FIRST,
 TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE,  and no more, shall be granted to a charter
 for a school to be located in a city having a population of one  million
 or  more.  TO PROMOTE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY IN EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND
 PRIORITIZE THE ISSUANCE OF NEW CHARTERS TO COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS
 RUN BY INDIVIDUALS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES, THREE
 HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX OF SUCH CHARTERS ISSUED ON OR AFTER JULY  FIRST,  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE, AND NO MORE, SHALL BE GRANTED TO A CHARTER FOR A
 SCHOOL TO BE MANAGED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SCHOOL-BASED  MANAGEMENT
 OR  LEADERSHIP  TEAM,  WHERE BOTH OF WHICH WILL BE COMPRISED OF AT LEAST
 FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF MEMBERS WHO MEET THE ETHNIC DEFINITION OF  MINORITY
 GROUP  MEMBER  SET  FORTH IN ARTICLE FIFTEEN-A OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW. The
 failure of any body to issue the regulations authorized pursuant to this
 article shall not affect the authority of a charter entity to propose  a
 charter  to  the  board of regents or the board of regents' authority to
 grant such charter. A conversion of an existing public school to a char-
 ter school, or the renewal or extension of a  charter  approved  by  any
 charter  entity, shall not be counted toward the numerical limits estab-
 lished by this subdivision.
  (a) The board of regents is hereby authorized and  directed  to  issue
 [four]  SEVEN  hundred [sixty] NINETY-SIX charters statewide upon either
 applications submitted directly to the board  of  regents  or  upon  the
 recommendation  of  the board of trustees of the state university of New
 York pursuant to a competitive request for proposals process.
  The board of regents shall make a determination  to  issue  a  charter
 pursuant  to a request for proposals no later than December thirty-first
 of each year.
  The board of regents and the board of trustees of the state university
 of New York shall each develop such request for proposals  in  a  manner
 that  facilitates  a  thoughtful  review of charter school applications,
 considers the demand for charter  schools  by  the  community,  PROMOTES
 EQUITY  AND  DIVERSITY  IN  EDUCATIONAL  LEADERSHIP, and seeks to locate
 charter schools in a region or regions where there  may  be  a  lack  of
 alternatives  and  access  to charter schools would provide new alterna-
 tives within the local public education  system  that  would  offer  the
 greatest  educational  benefit to students. Applications shall be evalu-
 ated in accordance with the criteria and objectives contained  within  a
 request for proposals. The board of regents and the board of trustees of
 the  state  university  of  New York shall not consider any applications
 which do not rigorously demonstrate that they  have  met  the  following
 criteria:
  (viii)  PROMOTING  DIVERSITY  IN EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND INCREASING
 THE NUMBER  OF  EDUCATION  LEADERS  FROM  HISTORICALLY  UNDERREPRESENTED
 COMMUNITIES BY ESTABLISHING A BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SCHOOL-BASED MANAGE-
 MENT  OR  LEADERSHIP  TEAM  OF AT LEAST FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF MEMBERS WHO
 MEET THE ETHNIC DEFINITION OF MINORITY GROUP MEMBER SET FORTH IN ARTICLE
 FIFTEEN-A OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW;
  (IX) demonstrating the support of the school  district  in  which  the
 proposed  charter  school will be located and the intent to establish an
 ongoing relationship with such school district.
