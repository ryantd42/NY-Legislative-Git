 charging station complexes shall offer the two most used  level  3  fast
 charger  technologies on all of the electric vehicle chargers for all of
 the eight spaces.
  (b) No person shall park in a space  equipped  with  a  charger  at  a
 public electric vehicle charging station, unless such person is charging

 ty and location of public electric vehicle charging stations,  including
