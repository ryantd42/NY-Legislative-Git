  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  the  use  of fossil fuels result in greenhouse gas emis-
 sions. The state has a goal of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by
 eighty  percent  below  1990  levels  by  2050 to combat climate change.
 Therefore, the state has an interest in reducing tax  expenditures  that
 support  fossil  fuels. By creating a process through which the legisla-
 ture would review existing fossil fuel tax  expenditures  on  a  regular
 basis, the state can better ensure that they are in the public interest.
  §  2.  Subdivision 1 of section 181 of the executive law is amended by
 adding two new paragraphs (c) and (d) to read as follows:
  (C) "FOSSIL FUEL" SHALL HAVE THE SAME DEFINITION AS IN  SECTION  1-103
 OF THE ENERGY LAW AND INCLUDE BIODIESEL.
  (D) "FOSSIL FUEL RELATED TAX EXPENDITURES" SHALL MEAN TAX EXPENDITURES
 THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, TRANS-
 PORTATION, STORAGE, SALE, PURCHASE OR DELIVERY OF FOSSIL FUELS.
  § 3. The opening paragraph and paragraphs (f) and (g) of subdivision 2
 of section 181 of the executive law, the opening paragraph as amended by
 chapter  309  of the laws of 1996 and paragraphs (f) and (g) as added by
 chapter 23 of the laws of 1990, are amended and two new  paragraphs  (h)
 and (i) are added to read as follows:
  In  addition  to  the  information  required  by  article seven of the
 constitution and section twenty-two of the state finance law, the gover-
 nor shall submit to the legislature AND MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC  ON
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
