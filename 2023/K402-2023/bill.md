  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 6-12, 2023, as Nurses Week in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 6-12, 2023, as Nurses Week in  the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Nurses
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  May  6th  is known as National Nurses Day, and May 12th is
the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing; and
 
  WHEREAS, The nearly 2.9 million  registered  nurses  in  the  United
States  comprise  our  nation's  largest health care profession with New
York State accounting for over 256,000 of those registered nurses; and
 
  WHEREAS, The depth and breadth of the registered nursing  profession
meets  the  different  and  emerging  health  care needs of the American
population in a wide range of settings; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Nurses  Association,  as  the  voice  for  the
registered  nurses of this country, is working to chart a new course for
a healthy nation that relies  on  increasing  delivery  of  primary  and
preventive health care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  renewed  emphasis on primary and preventive health care
will require the better utilization of all of  our  nation's  registered
nursing resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Professional  nursing  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  an
indispensable  component  in  the  safety  and  quality  of  care  of
hospitalized patients; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The demand for registered nursing services will be greater
than  ever  because  of  the  aging  of  the  American  population,  the
continuing  expansion  of  life-sustaining technology, and the explosive
growth of home health care services; and
 
  WHEREAS, More qualified registered nurses  will  be  needed  in  the
future  to  meet the increasingly complex needs of health care consumers
in this community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The cost-effective, safe and quality health  care  services
provided  by  registered nurses will be an ever more important component
of the United States health care delivery system in the future; and
 
  WHEREAS, Often described as an art  and  a  science,  nursing  is  a
profession  which  embraces  dedicated  people  with  varied  interests,
strengths and passions because of the many opportunities the  profession
offers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 6-12, 2023, as  Nurses
Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body  pause further to celebrate
registered nursing's accomplishments and efforts to improve  our  health
care  system  and  to  show our appreciation for the nation's registered
nurses not just during this week, but at  every  opportunity  throughout
the year; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
