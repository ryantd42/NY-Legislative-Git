 AN  ACT to acknowledge the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and
  inhumanity of slavery in the city of New York and  the  state  of  New
  York;  to establish the New York state community commission on repara-
  tions remedies, to examine the institution of slavery, subsequently de

  Americans,  and the impact of these forces on living African-Americans

  ation therefor; and providing for the repeal of such  provisions  upon

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 state community commission on reparations remedies".
  §  2. Legislative intent.  Contrary to what many people believe, slav-
 ery was not just a southern institution. Prior  to  the  American  Revo-
 lution,  there  were more enslaved Africans in New York City than in any
 other city except Charleston, South Carolina. During this period, slaves
 accounted for 20% of the population of New York and approximately 40% of
 colonial New York's households owned slaves. These slaves were an  inte-
 gral part of the population which settled and developed what we now know
 as the state of New York.
  The  first  slaves arrived in New Amsterdam, a Dutch settlement estab-
 lished at the southern tip  of  Manhattan  Island,  around  1627.  These
 enslaved  Africans  did  not  belong  to individuals, but worked for the
 Dutch West India Company. The Dutch East India Company  had  established
 Fort  Amsterdam,  a  fortification  located  on  the southern tip of the
 island of Manhattan, for the purpose  of  defending  the  company's  fur
 trade  operations  in the North River, now known as the Hudson River. In

 1624, New Amsterdam became a provincial extension of the Dutch  Republic
 and it was designated the capital of the province in 1625.
  These first enslaved Africans cleared forests, prepared land for agri-
 culture  and  built  an  infrastructure of roads, buildings and walls of
 timber and earthwork, including the wall  that  gives  Wall  Street  its
 name.  During  the following years, more and more enslaved Africans were
 brought to the New World for the purpose of expanding the settlement.
  New Amsterdam came under English control in 1664 and was  renamed  New
 York  in  honor  of the then Duke of York, in whose name the English had
 captured it. Three years later, the Dutch gave up  their  claim  to  the
 town  and  the  rest  of  the colony, in exchange for control of certain
 trade routes and areas.
  The change of control of the city did not deter  slavery;  it  was  an
 enormously profitable enterprise and it continued under the English. New
 York  businesses  engaged  directly  in  slave  trade  and  also  in the
 production of supplies used in the slave trade.  They  supplied  food,
 tools  and  grain  to slave plantations in North America and in the West
 Indies.  Slave labor built and maintained ships used for  trade  between
 North  America,  Europe, the Caribbean and Africa. Slaves produced goods
 for sale and worked in private homes.  Even  newspapers  benefited  from
 slavery:  advertisements of slaves for purchase were a major source of
 revenue for the papers during the eighteenth century.
  Life was repressive for enslaved Africans in New York.  The  New  York
 City  Common  Council  passed  a  number of restrictive laws designed at
 curtailing the rights and freedoms of slaves.  Slaves were  barred  from
 owning  significant  property  and from bequeathing what they did own to
 their children. The number of people of African descent who could gather
 in one place was limited. Restrictions on  movement  included  requiring
 slaves  to carry lanterns after dark and to remain in certain geographic
 areas.
  Penalties for breaking these and other  laws  were  severe.  Beatings,
 mutilations and executions were common.
  Enslaved Africans refused to submit to the slave existence. The condi-
 tions  of their lives gave rise to rebellions and the development in the
 city of a network of the Underground Railroad.
  Not all citizens of New York agreed with slavery.  A  powerful  aboli-
 tionist  movement  developed, but the end of slavery in New York did not
 come easily or quickly. Those who profited from the slave economy fought
 to maintain the system.
  In 1799 the New York state legislature passed "An Act for the  Gradual
 Abolition  of  Slavery". This legislation was a first step in the direc-
 tion of emancipation, but did not have an immediate effect or affect all
 slaves. Rather, it provided for gradual manumission. All  children  born
 to  slave  women after July 4, 1799 would be freed, but only after their
 most productive years: age 28 for men  and  age  25  for  women.  Slaves
 already  in  servitude  before July 4, 1799 were reclassified as "inden-
 tured servants", but in reality, remained slaves  for  the  duration  of
 their lives.
  In  1817,  the  Legislature enacted a statute that gave freedom to New
 York slaves who had been born before July 4, 1799. This statute did  not
 become effective until July 4, 1827, however.
  Despite  these laws, there were exceptions under which certain persons
 could still own slaves. Non-residents could enter New York  with  slaves
 for  up  to nine months, and allowing part-time residents to bring their
 slaves into the state temporarily. The  nine-months  exception  remained
 S. 1163  3
 
 law  until  its repeal in 1841, when the North was re-defining itself as
 the "free" region in advance of the civil war.
  In  1991,  a huge African burial ground was discovered in the heart of
 New York's financial district during construction of a  skyscraper.  The
 excavations  that  followed  the termination of the construction project
 yielded the skeletal remains of 419 Africans, many of  whom  were  women
 and children.
  The  slavery  that  flourished  in  the  New York state constituted an
 immoral and inhumane deprivation of  Africans'  life,  liberty,  African
 citizenship rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the fruits of
 their  own  labor. Sufficient inquiry has not been made into the effects
 of the institution of slavery on living African-Americans and society in
 New York.
  § 3. Establishment, purpose and duties of the commission.  a.  Estab-
 lishment.  There  is  hereby  established  the  New York state community
