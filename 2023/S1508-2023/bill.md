 Introduced  by  Sen.  BAILEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Insurance
 
 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to  requiring  all  motor
  vehicle  insurers  to  file  annual  financial statements and detailed
  claim data with the superintendent of financial services

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that insurance companies issuing motor vehicle policies in this
 state owe a duty to those they insure and to those who may in the future
 be insured by them, to fully disclose in a public and transparent manner
 all elements relating to their financial condition  and  solvency.  Such
 obligation  is  essential  in maintaining the public's inherent right to
 know the details and specifics of such  insurer's  expenses  and  claims
 history on a global basis so, as consumers, they can make a reasoned and
 rational selection of the insurer with which they intend to do business.
 As  premiums  escalate,  it  is more incumbent on such insurers to honor
 this obligation by making the public aware of the rationale they use  in
 determining  the premiums they charge, and it is the sense of the legis-
 lature that where the data used is available, it should be disclosed  in
 an open and public manner.
  §  2. The insurance law is amended by adding a new section 346 to read
 as follows:
  § 346. FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND DETAILED CLAIM DATA TO  BE  FILED  WITH
 THE  DEPARTMENT.  (A) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "INSURER"
 SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON, CORPORATION, ASSOCIATION OR OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY
 AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE A MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE POLICY IN THIS STATE.
  (B) ON OR BEFORE APRIL FIRST OF EACH YEAR, EVERY INSURER SHALL PROVIDE
 THE SUPERINTENDENT WITH A DETAILED FINANCIAL STATEMENT TO SUPPLEMENT AND
 EXPAND UPON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE STATUTORY ANNUAL  STATEMENT
 FOR  THE  MOST RECENTLY CONCLUDED CALENDAR YEAR. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
