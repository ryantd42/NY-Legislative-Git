 for the prevention of cruelty to animals, humane society, pound,  animal
 shelter,  SHERIFF, MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, DISTRICT ATTORNEY or any
 authorized agents thereof, hereinafter referred to for the  purposes  of
 this  section as the "impounding organization", may file a petition with
 the court in which criminal charges have been filed requesting that  the
 person  from  whom  an  animal  is  seized or the owner of the animal be
 ordered to post a security. The district attorney prosecuting the charg-
 es may file and obtain the requested relief on behalf of the  impounding
 organization  if  requested to do so by the impounding organization. The
 security shall be in an amount sufficient  to  secure  payment  for  all
 reasonable  expenses expected to be incurred by the impounding organiza-
 tion in caring and providing for the animal pending disposition  of  the
 charges. Reasonable expenses shall include, but not be limited to, esti-
 mated  medical care and boarding of the animal for at least thirty days.
 The amount of the security, if any, shall be  determined  by  the  court
 after  taking  into  consideration all of the facts and circumstances of
 the case including,  but  not  limited  to  the  recommendation  of  the
 impounding organization having custody and care of the seized animal and
 the  cost  of  caring  for  the animal. If a security has been posted in
 accordance with this section, the impounding organization may draw  from
 the  security  the actual reasonable costs to be incurred by such organ-
 ization in caring for the seized animal.
  b. (1) Upon receipt of a petition pursuant  to  paragraph  a  of  this
 subdivision  the  court  shall  set  a  hearing  on  the  petition to be
 conducted within ten business days of the filing of such  petition.  The
 petitioner  shall  serve  a true copy of the petition upon the defendant
 and the district attorney if the district attorney  has  not  filed  the
 petition  on behalf of the petitioner. The petitioner shall also serve a
 true copy of the petition on any interested person. For purposes of this
 subdivision, interested person shall mean  an  individual,  partnership,
 firm,  joint  stock  company, corporation, association, trust, estate or
 other legal entity who the court determines may have a pecuniary  inter-
 est  in  the animal which is the subject of the petition. The petitioner
 or the district attorney acting on behalf of the petitioner, shall  have
 S. 4279  4
 
 the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
 from  whom  the  animal was seized violated a provision of this article.
 The court may waive for good cause shown the posting of security.
  (2)  If the court orders the posting of a security, the security shall
 be posted with the clerk of the court within five business days  of  the
 hearing  provided  for  in subparagraph one of this paragraph. The court
 may order the immediate forfeiture of the seized animal to the  impound-
 ing  organization if the person ordered to post the security fails to do
 so. Any animal forfeited shall be made available for adoption or euthan-
 ized subject to subdivision seven-a of section one hundred seventeen  of
 this chapter or section three hundred seventy-four of this article.
  (3)  In the case of an animal other than a companion animal or pet, if
 a person ordered to post security fails to do  so,  the  court  may,  in
 addition  to  the  forfeiture  to  [a  duly incorporated society for the
 prevention of cruelty to animals, humane society, pound, animal  shelter
 or  any  authorized  agents  thereof]  THE  IMPOUNDING ORGANIZATION, and
 subject to the restrictions of sections three hundred fifty-four,  three
 hundred  fifty-seven  and  three  hundred  seventy-four of this article,
 order the animal which was the basis of the order to be  sold,  provided
 that  all  interested persons shall first be provided the opportunity to
 redeem their interest in the animal and to purchase the interest of  the
 person ordered to post security, subject to such conditions as the court
 deems appropriate to assure proper care and treatment of the animal. The
 court  may  reimburse the person ordered to post security and any inter-
 ested persons any money earned by the sale of the animal less any  costs
 including, but not limited to, veterinary and custodial care. Any animal
 determined by the court to be maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm so as
 to be unfit for sale or any useful purpose shall be forfeited to [a duly
 incorporated  society for the prevention of cruelty to animals or a duly
 incorporated humane society] THE IMPOUNDING ORGANIZATION  or  authorized
 agents  thereof,  and  be  available for adoption or shall be euthanized
 subject to section three hundred seventy-four of this article.
  (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict in
 any way the rights of a secured party having a security interest in  any
 animal described in this section. This section expressly does not impair
 or  subordinate  the  rights  of such a secured lender having a security
 interest in the animal or in the proceeds from the sale of such animal.
  c. In no event shall the security prevent the impounding  organization
 having  custody  and  care  of  the  animal from disposing of the animal
 pursuant to section three hundred seventy-four of this article prior  to
 the  expiration  of the thirty day period covered by the security if the
 court makes a determination of the charges against the person from  whom
 the animal was seized prior thereto. Upon receipt of a petition from the
 impounding  organization,  the  court may order the person from whom the
 animal was seized or the owner of the animal to post an additional secu-
 rity with the clerk  of  the  court  to  secure  payment  of  reasonable
 expenses for an additional period of time pending a determination by the
 court of the charges against the person from whom the animal was seized.
 The  person who posted the security shall be entitled to a refund of the
 security in whole or part for any expenses not incurred by such impound-
 ing organization upon adjudication of the charges. The person who posted
 the security shall be entitled to a full refund of the security, includ-
 ing reimbursement by the impounding organization of any  amount  allowed
 by  the  court  to  be expended, and the return of the animal seized and
 impounded upon acquittal or dismissal of the charges, except  where  the
 dismissal  is  based  upon  an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal
 S. 4279  5
 
 pursuant to section 215.30 of the  criminal  procedure  law.  The  court
 order  directing such refund and reimbursement shall provide for payment
 to be made within a reasonable time from the acquittal or  dismissal  of
 charges.
