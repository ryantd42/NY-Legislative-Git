 Introduced  by  Sen.  WEBB  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health  law,  in  relation  to  enacting  the
  "safer health care facility construction act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "safer health care facility construction act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings  and  intent.  The legislature finds that
 adopting infection control risk assessment (ICRA) standards for environ-
 mental infection control in health care facilities  is  a  long-standing
 recommendation  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
 The legislature further finds that  the  CDC  is  the  leading  national
 organization in being a science-based, data driven, service organization
 that  is  charged with protecting the public health. Leading health care
 organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo  Clinic,  and  Mass
 General  Hospital  have  all  embraced the adoption of ICRA standards in
 their health care facilities. Many of New  York's  leading  health  care
 facilities  have  also  worked  to  implement  ICRA  standards including
 Buffalo General, the University of  Rochester,  Albany  Medical  Center,
 Saint  Peter's,  United Health Services, and Westchester Medical Center.
 Leading health care facilities both in New York  state  and  around  the
 nation have adopted ICRA standards to confront the danger of health care
 associated  infections.  On any given day, the CDC estimates that one in
 thirty-one hospital patients has a  health  care  associated  infection.
 These  infections  have  direct  medical  costs of at least twenty-eight
 billion dollars annually. They also account  for  an  additional  twelve
 billion  dollars  in costs to society from early deaths and lost produc-
 tivity. The legislature has recognized the need for enhanced patient and
 worker safety having passed legislation to enact safe staffing levels in
 hospitals and nursing homes. Additionally, the legislature  also  passed

 the  New  York  health and essential rights (NY HERO) act to protect New
 Yorkers from airborne infectious diseases.  Therefore,  the  legislature
 finds and declares that it should be the policy of the state of New York
 to  require  all  new construction, renovation, remediation, repair, and
 demolition projects in health care facilities  regulated  by  the  state
 department  of  health  to  use ICRA standards to save lives by reducing
 health care associated infections and to protect patients, visitors, and
 workers.
  § 3. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 2831  to
 read as follows:
