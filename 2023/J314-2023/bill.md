February  1,  1926;  since  1976,  it has become a nationally recognized

acknowledge  and  pay  tribute  to  African-Americans  neglected by both
society and the history books; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  month  of  February  observes  the  rich  and  diverse
heritage of our great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  History  Month  seeks to emphasize Black History is
American History; and
 
  WHEREAS, Black History Month is a time to reflect on  the  struggles
and  victories of African-Americans throughout our country's history and
to recognize their numerous valuable contributions to the protection  of
our democratic society in war and in peace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some African-American pioneers whose many accomplishments,
all which took place during the month of  February,  went  unnoticed  as
well  as  numerous  symbolic  events  in  February,  that  deserve to be
memorialized include: John Sweat Rock, a noted Boston lawyer who  became

who was elected to the South Carolina Supreme Court on February 1, 1870;

U.S. Constitution, abolishing slavery, to the states for ratification on
February  1,  1865;  civil rights protester Jimmie Lee Jackson dies from

were  attacked  by  police;  Autherine  J.  Lucy  became  the  first
African-American student to attend the University of Alabama on February
3, 1956, she was expelled three days  later  "for  her  own  safety"  in
response to threats from a mob; in 1992, Autherine Lucy Foster graduated
from  the  University  with a Master's degree in Education, the same day
her daughter, Grazia Foster,  graduated  with  a  Bachelor's  degree  in
Corporate  Finance; the Negro Baseball League was founded on February 3,
1920; Jack Johnson, the first African-American World Heavyweight  Boxing
Champion,  won  his  first  title  on  February 3, 1903; and Reginald F.

law degree from Harvard Law School in 1968, and was a partner in Murphy,

he became President and CEO of TLC Beatrice International Food  Company,
the largest Black-owned business in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  the  vast  contributions  of
African-Americans, a joyful month-long celebration is  held  across  New
York  State  and across the United States with many commemorative events
to honor and display the cultural heritage of African-Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  commends  the  African-American
community for preserving,  for  future  generations,  its  centuries-old
traditions  that  benefit  us all and add to the color and beauty of the
tapestry which is our American society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim February 2023, as Black
History Month in the State of New York; and be it further
