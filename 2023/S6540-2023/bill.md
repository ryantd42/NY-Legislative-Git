 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  an  extended  producer responsibility program for desig-
  nated products; and to amend the state finance  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing an extended producer responsibility program fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The article heading of  article  27  of  the  environmental
 conservation law is amended to read as follows:
  REDUCTION, COLLECTION, REUSE, RECYCLING,
  TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF [REFUSE AND OTHER] SOLID WASTE AND
  EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY
  §  2. Section 27-0101 of the environmental conservation law is amended
 by adding a new subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3. IT IS FURTHERMORE THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATURE OF  THE  STATE  OF
 NEW  YORK  TO  PROMOTE  EXTENDED  PRODUCER  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  CERTAIN
 PRODUCTS. EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY IS  A  STATUTORY  REQUIREMENT
 THAT  EXTENDS  THE RESPONSIBILITY BORNE BY PRODUCERS OF PRODUCTS USED IN
 THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR THE POST-CONSUMER MANAGEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS,
 THROUGH PROGRAMS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT.  SUCH  A  REQUIREMENT:  (A)
 SHIFTS  FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM TAXPAYERS AND MUNICIPALITIES;
 (B) INCENTIVIZES PRODUCERS TO INCORPORATE  ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSIDERATIONS
 INTO  THE  CREATION  OF  THEIR  PRODUCTS, SUCH AS DESIGNING PRODUCTS FOR
 DURABILITY, REUSE, REMANUFACTURING, AND RECYCLING; (C)  PROMOTES  HIGHER
 RATES  OF  RESOURCE  RECOVERY,  REUSE, AND RECYCLING AND ENVIRONMENTALLY
 RESPONSIBLE DISPOSAL; AND (D) ENCOURAGES COLLABORATION, EFFICIENCY,  AND
 EQUITABLE  APPLICATION  OF  THE  LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF
 ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATION AMONG VARIOUS PRODUCERS  WHO  MAY
 BE COMPETITORS IN THE MARKETPLACE.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
