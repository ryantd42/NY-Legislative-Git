  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 11-17, 2023, as Black Maternal Health Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 11-17, 2023, as
Black Maternal Health Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The inaugural National Black Maternal  Health  Week  (BMHW)
campaign,  founded and led by the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, is a week
of awareness, activism, and community building; and
 
  WHEREAS, Intended to  increase  attention  in  the  State  of  Black
maternal  health  in  the  U.S., the root causes of poor maternal health
outcomes, and community-driven policy, program, and care solutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, it serves as a  national  platform  for  Black
women-led  entities  and  efforts on maternal health, birth justice, and
reproductive justice, including African immigrant and Afro Latin groups;
and to  enhance  community  organizing  on  Black  maternal  health  via
community conversations, events, and outreach; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States spends more on health care than any other
country, it has among the worst disparities in maternal health outcomes,
and  is  on  the  opposite  track for improving maternal health with its
mortality rates increasing between 1990 and 2013; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Maternal  Health  challenges  are  clearly  linked  to
disparities  in  women's  access  to  high  quality  health care, social
determinants of health such as poverty  and  racism,  and  other  needed
resources  before,  during,  and  after pregnancy that have a cumulative
impact on women's bodies; and
 
  WHEREAS, These disparities and challenges particularly affect  Black
women who are up to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related
causes,  and  more  than  twice  as likely to experience severe maternal
morbidity compared to white women; and
 
  WHEREAS, Black  women  experienced  40.4  deaths  per  100,000  live
births, compared to 12.1 deaths per 100,000 lives for white women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  deaths  have  devastating  effects on Black women's
children and families, and the vast  majority  is  entirely  preventable
through  assertive efforts to ensure Black women can access information,
services,  and  supports  to  make  their  own  health  care  decision
particularly around pregnancy and childbearing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater equitable access to
prevention, early identification, and effective treatment services  that
are  delivered  in  appropriate  care  setting  to improve Black women's
chronic health conditions and maternal health; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  11-17,  2023,  as
Black Maternal Health Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the  State  of
New York.
