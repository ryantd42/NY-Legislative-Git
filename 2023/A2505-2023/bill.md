 necessary to effectuate fire protection and emergency response  services
 in  rural  areas  throughout  the state of New York. Appointments to the
 task force shall be made as follows: two by the  governor;  two  by  the
 speaker  of  the assembly; two by the temporary president of the senate;
 one by the minority leader of the senate; and one by the minority leader
 of the assembly.  The appointments of the governor shall  be  a  member,
 officer  or  employee  of  the Fireman's Association of the State of New
 York and the state fire administrator of the office of  fire  prevention
 and control or his or her designee.
  2.  The  task  force shall examine current regulations and establish a
 set of standards that are applicable only in rural areas as  defined  in
 this  subdivision.  These standards shall be aimed at being less burden-
 some for rural areas than the  current  regulations  are  and  shall  be
 designed  to  encourage  citizens to volunteer their services.  The task
 force shall also examine  the  necessity  of  having  uniform  standards
 across the state.  The task force shall issue a report within ten months
 after  the effective date of this section and shall make recommendations
 to the legislature regarding any suggested changes  in  the  law  or  to
 existing regulations.  For purposes of this section, "rural areas" means
 counties  within  the state having a population of less than two hundred
 thousand, and the municipalities,  individuals,  institutions,  communi-

 "rural areas" means towns with population densities of one hundred fifty
 persons  or  less per square mile, and the villages, individuals, insti-
 tutions, communities, programs and such other entities or  resources  as
 are found therein.
