  § 442. MINIMUM  STANDARDS  OF  ANIMAL CARE. BREEDERS SHALL COMPLY WITH
 THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM STANDARDS OF CARE FOR EVERY ANIMAL IN THEIR CUSTO-
 DY OR POSSESSION.
  1. HOUSING. (A) ANIMALS SHALL  BE  HOUSED  IN  PRIMARY  ENCLOSURES  OR
 CAGES,  WHICH  SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO BE STRUCTURALLY SOUND. SUCH
 ENCLOSURES SHALL BE MAINTAINED IN GOOD  REPAIR  TO  CONTAIN  THE  ANIMAL
 HOUSED  INSIDE AND PROTECT IT FROM INJURY. SURFACES SHALL HAVE AN IMPER-
 VIOUS SURFACE SO AS NOT TO PERMIT THE ABSORPTION OF FLUIDS AND WHICH CAN
 BE THOROUGHLY AND REPEATEDLY CLEANED AND DISINFECTED  WITHOUT  RETAINING
 ODORS.
  (B)  PRIMARY  ENCLOSURES  OR  CAGES  HOUSING THE ANIMALS SHALL PROVIDE
 SUFFICIENT SPACE TO ALLOW EACH ANIMAL ADEQUATE FREEDOM  OF  MOVEMENT  TO
 MAKE  NORMAL  POSTURAL  ADJUSTMENTS,  INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO STAND UP,

 IS  CONSTRUCTED  OF  METAL STRANDS, SUCH STRANDS SHALL EITHER BE GREATER
 THAN ONE-EIGHTH INCH IN DIAMETER (NINE GAUGE WIRE) OR  SHALL  BE  COATED
 WITH MATERIAL SUCH AS PLASTIC OR FIBERGLASS, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED SO

 FLOOR OF THE ENCLOSURE. SUCH FLOORING SHALL NOT SAG OR BEND SUBSTANTIAL-
 LY BETWEEN STRUCTURAL SUPPORTS.
  (C) HOUSING FACILITIES SHALL BE ADEQUATELY VENTILATED AT ALL TIMES  TO
 PROVIDE  FOR  THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE ANIMAL. VENTILATION SHALL
 BE PROVIDED BY NATURAL OR MECHANICAL  MEANS,  SUCH  AS  WINDOWS,  VENTS,
 FANS,  OR AIR CONDITIONERS. VENTILATION SHALL BE ESTABLISHED TO MINIMIZE
 DRAFTS, ODORS, AND MOISTURE CONDENSATION.

 INCLUDE SUPPLYING SHADE FROM SUNLIGHT BY NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL MEANS.
  (E) THE INDOOR FACILITIES HOUSING THE ANIMALS SHALL BE  PROVIDED  WITH
 ADEQUATE  LIGHTING  SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT ROUTINE INSPECTION AND CLEANING
 AND BE ARRANGED SO THAT EACH ANIMAL IS PROTECTED FROM EXCESSIVE  ILLUMI-
 NATION WHICH POSES A HEALTH HAZARD TO THE ANIMAL.
  (F)  THE  INDOOR AND OUTDOOR FACILITIES HOUSING THE ANIMALS, INCLUDING
 THE PRIMARY ENCLOSURE OR CAGE, SHALL BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR THE  EFFI-
 CIENT  ELIMINATION OF ANIMAL WASTE AND WATER IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ANIMAL
 DRY  AND  PREVENT  THE  ANIMAL  FROM  COMING  INTO  CONTACT  WITH  THESE
 SUBSTANCES.  IF DRAINS ARE USED THEY SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED IN A MANNER TO
 MINIMIZE  FOUL ODORS AND BACKUPS OF SEWAGE. IF A DRAINAGE SYSTEM IS USED
 IT SHALL COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS RELATING TO POLLUTION
 CONTROL.
  (G) IN THE EVENT THAT A BREEDER HAS A PREGNANT OR NURSING DOG  ON  HIS
 OR HER PREMISES, THE BREEDER SHALL PROVIDE A WHELPING BOX FOR SUCH DOG.
  2.  SANITATION.  HOUSING  FACILITIES, INCLUDING PRIMARY ENCLOSURES AND

 ANIMAL.  TRASH  AND  WASTE  PRODUCTS  ON  THE PREMISES SHALL BE PROPERLY

 CONTAMINATION, AND VERMIN.
