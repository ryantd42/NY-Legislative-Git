  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 7-13, 2023, as Brain Tumor Action  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 7-13, 2023, as Brain
Tumor Action Week in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Brain Tumor Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Brain Tumor Awareness Month was developed to raise
awareness about brain tumors, as well as incidence, diagnosis, treatment
and care of people suffering from brain tumors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  more than 190,000 people in the United States
are diagnosed with a brain tumor; in approximately 30-40% of  cases  the
first warning sign of a brain tumor is a seizure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Brain tumors are a leading cause of tumor cancer deaths in
children, and the third main cause of cancer death in adults within  the
20-39 year age bracket; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Specialty care and follow-up care, rehabilitative services
and clinical trials can enhance the quality of  life  of  people  living
with brain tumors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and national levels to support the patients as well  as
their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 7-13, 2023,  as  Brain
Tumor Action Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
