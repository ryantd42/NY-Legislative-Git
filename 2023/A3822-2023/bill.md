  § 3. (a) For the accomplishment of its purposes,  the  commission  may
 meet and hold public and/or private hearings within or without the state
 and shall have all the powers of a legislative committee pursuant to the
 legislative  law. The commission is authorized to consult with community
 leaders  and  empowered  to undertake any studies, inquiries, surveys or
 analyses it may deem relevant through its own personnel  or  in  cooper-
 ation  with or by agreement with any other public or private agency. The
 commission shall consult with other departments or agencies of the state
 or subdivisions thereof as necessary when the  renaming  of  a  project,
 piece  of  infrastructure,  facility or site involves such other depart-
 ments or agencies of the state or subdivisions thereof.
  (b) To the maximum extent feasible, the  commission  may  request  and
 shall be entitled to receive and shall utilize and be provided with such
 facilities,  resources and data from any court in the state and from any
 subdivision, department, board, bureau, commission,  office,  agency  or
 other instrumentality of the state or of any political subdivision ther-
 eof  as  it deems necessary or desirable for the proper execution of its
 powers and duties and to effectuate the purposes set forth in this act.
  (c) The commission is hereby authorized and empowered  to  enter  into
 any  agreements  and  to  do and perform any acts that may be necessary,
 desirable or proper to carry out the purposes  and  objectives  of  this
 act.
  §  4.  (a) The commission shall make and submit their name recommenda-
 tions to the commissioner of the New York state office of parks,  recre-
 ation  and  historic preservation, the temporary president of the senate
 and the speaker of the assembly.  Such recommendations  shall  be  made
 within  six  months  after  all  members  of  the  commission  have been
 appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) of section two of this act.
  (b) Once such recommendations  are  received  and  decided  upon,  the
 commissioner  of  the  New  York  state  office of parks, recreation and
 historic preservation shall take all necessary  steps  to  proceed  with
 such renaming. Where applicable, the commissioner shall work in conjunc-
 tion  with  other  departments  or agencies of the state or subdivisions
 thereof to proceed with such renaming.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed on the first date next succeeding the date of the renam-
 ing  of  all  projects,  infrastructure,  facilities or sites within the
 state which are named after or include any reference to Robert Moses  as
 required under this act; and provided further, however, that the commis-
 sioner  of  the  New York state office of parks, recreation and historic
 preservation shall notify the legislative bill drafting commission  upon
 the renaming of all projects, infrastructure, facilities or sites within
 the state which are named after or include any reference to Robert Moses
 as  required under this act in order that the commission may maintain an
 accurate and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws
 of the state of New York in furtherance of effecting the  provisions  of
 section  44  of the legislative law and section 70-b of the public offi-
 cers law.
