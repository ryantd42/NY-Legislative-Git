  § 20. Subdivisions a and b of section 11-401.1 of  the  administrative
 code  of  the  city  of New York, as added by local law number 37 of the
 city of New York for the year 1996, are amended to read as follows:
  a. The commissioner of finance shall, not less than sixty days preced-
 ing the date of the sale of a tax lien  or  tax  liens,  submit  to  the
 commissioner  of  housing  preservation and development a description by
 block and lot, or by such other identification as  the  commissioner  of
 finance may deem appropriate, of any parcel of class one, CLASS ONE-A or
 class  two  real property on which there is a tax lien that may be fore-
 closed by the city. The commissioner of housing preservation and  devel-
 opment shall determine, and direct the commissioner of finance, not less
 than ten days preceding the date of the sale of a tax lien or tax liens,
 whether  any such parcel is a distressed property as defined in subdivi-
 sion four of section 11-401 of this chapter. Any tax lien on a parcel so
 determined to be a distressed property shall not  be  included  in  such
 sale.  In  connection with a subsequent sale of a tax lien or tax liens,
 the commissioner of finance may, not less than sixty days preceding  the
 date  of  the sale, resubmit to the commissioner of housing preservation
 and development a description by block and lot, or by such  other  iden-
 tification  as  the commissioner of finance may deem appropriate, of any
 parcel of class one, CLASS ONE-A or class two  real  property  that  was
 previously determined to be a distressed property pursuant to this para-
 graph  and  on  which  there  is a tax lien that may be included in such
 S. 2205  17
 
 sale. The commissioner of housing  preservation  and  development  shall
 determine,  and  direct  the  commissioner of finance, not less than ten
 days preceding the date of the  sale,  whether  such  parcel  remains  a
 distressed  property.  If  the  commissioner of housing preservation and
 development determines that the parcel is  not  a  distressed  property,
 then the tax lien on the parcel may be included in the sale.
  b.  The commissioner of housing preservation and development may peri-
 odically review whether a parcel of class one, CLASS ONE-A or class  two
 real property that is subject to subdivision c of this section or subdi-
 vision  j of section 11-412.1 of this chapter remains a distressed prop-
 erty. If the commissioner determines that the parcel is not a distressed
 property as defined in subdivision four of section 11-401 of this  chap-
 ter, then the parcel shall not be subject to such subdivisions.
  §  21.  Subdivision  b of section 11-404 of the administrative code of
 the city of New York, as amended by local law number 37 of the  city  of
 New York for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:
  b. A tax lien on any class one property or any class [two] ONE-A prop-
 erty  [that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative], as
 such classes of property are defined in subdivision one of section eigh-
 teen hundred two of the real property  tax  law,  and  on  any  multiple
 dwelling  owned  by  a  company  organized pursuant to article XI of the
 private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the depart-
 ment of housing preservation and development, shall not be foreclosed in
 the manner provided in this chapter until such tax lien has been due and
 unpaid for a period of at least three years from the date on  which  the
 tax, assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien.
  §  22.  Paragraph 5 of subdivision c of section 11-405 of the adminis-
 trative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 37 of
 the city of New York for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:
  (5) Notwithstanding paragraph one, two or three of  this  subdivision,
 with  respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed on
 or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner
 of finance may also exclude or thereafter  remove  from  such  list  any
 parcel  of class one, CLASS ONE-A or class two real property, other than
 a parcel described in paragraph four of this subdivision, as to which an
 agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such  commissioner
 for  the  payment  of  the  delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal
 charges, and the interest and penalties thereon,  in  installments.  The
 first  installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the install-
 ment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount equal  to
 not  less  than  fifteen  percent of the total amount of such delinquent
 taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties
 thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number  of
 unpaid  quarters  of  real  estate  taxes or the equivalent thereof, but
 which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number,  shall  be  payable
 quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For the
 purposes  of  calculating  the  number  of  such remaining installments,
 unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a  quar-
 terly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.
  § 23. Section 581 of the real property tax law is REPEALED.

 S. 2205  18
 
  1.  (a)  With  respect  to all property submitted to the provisions of
 this article other than property which is the  subject  of  a  qualified
 leasehold  condominium, each unit and its common interest, not including
 any personal property, shall be deemed to  be  a  parcel  and  shall  be
 subject  to  separate  assessment  and  taxation by each assessing unit,
 school district, special district, county or other taxing unit, for  all
 types of taxes authorized by law including but not limited to special ad
 valorem  levies and special assessments, except that the foregoing shall
 not apply to a unit held under lease or sublease unless the  declaration
 requires  the  unit  owner  to  pay  all taxes attributable to his unit.
 Neither the building, the property nor any of the common elements  shall
 be deemed to be a parcel.
  (b)  [In  no  event shall the aggregate of the assessment of the units
 plus their common interests exceed the total valuation of  the  property
 were the property assessed as a parcel.
  (c)]  For  the  purposes  of  this and the next succeeding section the
 terms "assessing unit",  "assessment",  "parcel",  "special  ad  valorem
 levy",  "special assessment", "special district", "taxation" and "taxes"
 shall have the meanings specified in section one hundred two of the real
 property tax law.
  [(d) The provisions of paragraph (b) of  this  subdivision  shall  not
 apply to such real property classified within:
  (i) on and after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, class one
 of  section one thousand eight hundred two of the real property tax law;
 or
  (ii) on and after January first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four,  the
 homestead  class  of  an  approved  assessing unit which has adopted the
 provisions of section one thousand nine hundred three of the real  prop-
 erty  tax law, or the homestead class of the portion outside an approved
 assessing unit of an eligible split school district  which  has  adopted
 the  provisions of section nineteen hundred three-a of the real property
 tax law; provided, however, that, in an approved  assessing  unit  which
 adopted the provisions of section one thousand nine hundred three of the
 real  property  tax law prior to the effective date of this subdivision,
 paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall apply to all such real  property
 (i) which is classified within the homestead class pursuant to paragraph
 one  of  subdivision (e) of section one thousand nine hundred one of the
 real property tax law and (ii) which, regardless of classification,  was
 on  the  assessment roll prior to the effective date of this subdivision
 unless the governing body of such approved assessing  unit  provides  by
 local  law  adopted  after a public hearing, prior to the taxable status
 date of such assessing unit next occurring after December  thirty-first,
 nineteen  hundred  eighty-three, that such paragraph (b) shall not apply
 to such real property to which this clause  applies.  Provided  further,
 however,  real  property  subject to the provisions of this subparagraph
 shall be assessed pursuant to subdivision two of  section  five  hundred
 eighty-one of the real property tax law.
  (e)] (C) On the first assessment roll with a taxable status date on or
 after the effective date of a declaration filed with the recording offi-
 cer  and  on  every assessment roll thereafter, the assessor shall enter
 each unit as a parcel, as provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision,
 based upon the condition and ownership of each such unit on  the  appro-
 priate  valuation  and  taxable status dates. Units owned by a developer
 may be entered as a single parcel with a parcel description  correspond-
 ing  to  the  entire development, including the land under such develop-
 ment, and excluding those units appearing  separately.  Upon  the  first
 S. 2205  19
 
 assessment roll where each unit is separately assessed, only an individ-
 ual unit and its common interest shall constitute a parcel.
  [(f)  The  provisions  of  paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall not
 apply to a converted condominium unit in a municipal  corporation  other
 than  a  special assessing unit, which has adopted, prior to the taxable
 status date of the assessment roll upon which its taxes will be  levied,
 a  local  law or, for a school district, a resolution providing that the
 provisions of paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall  not  apply  to  a
 converted  condominium  unit  within  that  municipal  corporation.  A
 converted condominium unit for purposes of this paragraph shall  mean  a
 dwelling  unit held in condominium form of ownership that has previously
 been on an assessment roll as a dwelling unit in other than  condominium
 form of ownership, and has not been previously subject to the provisions
 of paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  (g)] (D) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall not
 apply  to  real property owned or leased by a cooperative corporation or
 on a condominium basis in the Town of Greenburgh, in Westchester County,
 which has adopted, prior to the taxable status date  of  the  assessment
 roll upon which its taxes will be levied, a local law providing that the
 provisions  of paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall not apply to such
 real property within such town; provided,  however,  the  provisions  of
 this  paragraph  shall  not  apply to real property owned or leased by a
 cooperative corporation or on a condominium basis that had  been  previ-
 ously  subject  to  the  provisions of paragraph (b) of this subdivision
 prior to January first, two  thousand  twenty-three;  provided  further,
 however,  the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to real prop-
 erty owned or leased by a cooperative corporation or  on  a  condominium
 basis  that is participating in an affordable housing tax credit program
 or has a regulatory agreement with a federal,  state,  or  local  agency
 related to affordable housing requirements.
  § 25. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing  the  date  on  which  it shall have become a law and shall apply to
 assessment rolls prepared pursuant to a taxable status date occurring on
 or after such  date.  Effective  immediately,  the  addition,  amendment
 and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation
 of  this  act  on  its  effective  date  are  authorized  to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
