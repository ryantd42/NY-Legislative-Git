  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 8 of  arti-
 cle 2 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  8.  All  laws  creating, regulating or affecting boards or officers
 charged with the duty of qualifying voters, or of  distributing  ballots
 to  voters,  or  of receiving, recording or counting votes at elections,
 shall secure equal representation of the two political parties which, at
 the general election next preceding that for which such boards or  offi-
 cers  are  to  serve,  cast  the  highest and the next highest number of
 votes. All such boards and officers shall be  appointed  or  elected  in
 such  manner,  and  upon  the nomination of such representatives of said
 parties respectively, as the legislature may direct AND SHALL HAVE  SUCH
 OTHER  QUALIFICATIONS FOR PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES AS THE LEGISLATURE MAY
 DIRECT.  Existing laws on this subject shall continue until the legisla-
 ture shall otherwise provide. This section shall not apply to  town,  or
 village elections.
  §  2.  Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing amendment
 be referred to the first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
