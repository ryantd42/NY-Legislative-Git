 Introduced by M. of A. GLICK, REYES, GONZALEZ-ROJAS, BURDICK, MAMDANI --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to prohibiting the use of
  biometric surveillance technology by law enforcement; to establish the
  biometric  surveillance  regulation  task force; and providing for the
  repeal of certain provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds and declares the
 following:
  (a) The use of biometric  surveillance  technology  has  been  largely
 unregulated  by  all  levels of government in the United States to date,
 allowing its unfettered use by private  entities,  government,  and  law
 enforcement  with  little to no requirements or restrictions relating to
 use, data retention, privacy protections, and use of information derived
 from such systems in law enforcement investigations. In New  York,  this
 lack  of regulation and oversight has led to concerning practices by law
 enforcement, such as including sealed  mugshots  and  arrest  photos  of
 juveniles in facial recognition databases and running photos of celebri-
 ty lookalikes through facial recognition software to attempt to identify
 potential suspects.
  (b)  Studies  of currently available biometric surveillance technology
 demonstrate that such technology's consistency  and  accuracy  can  vary
 widely  based on age, gender, sex, race, and other factors, and has been
 found to be particularly inaccurate when used on  women,  young  people,
 and people of color.
  (c)  These accuracy concerns are particularly troubling in the context
 of this technology's ongoing and increasing use by law enforcement.  New
 York's  law  enforcement  should  not rely on technology that has demon-
 strated accuracy issues, as such practice risks the wrongful  targeting,

 interrogation, detention, or even conviction of an innocent person based
 on erroneous data.
  (d)  The  largest  U.S.  supplier  of police body cameras has publicly
 stated that  this  technology  "is  not  currently  reliable  enough  to
 ethically  justify  its  use," and other major companies working on this
 technology have chosen not to offer it for general  use  until  concerns
 about the technology's accuracy are resolved.
  (e) In addition to accuracy concerns, the continuous use of this tech-
 nology  for broad, untargeted surveillance purposes constitutes an unac-
 ceptable mass violation of privacy and could chill New Yorkers' right to
 free speech and freedom of assembly.
  (f) In order to protect the personal data, civil rights, civil  liber-
 ties,  and  due process rights of all New Yorkers, the use of this tech-
 nology by law enforcement should not currently be  permitted,  and  more
 study and research should be conducted into the impacts of this technol-
 ogy  before  determining  whether  it  should be authorized for use, and
 under what circumstances such use should be permitted.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a  new  section  837-x  to
 read as follows:

 States and abroad;
  (b)  Examine  current and proposed laws, rules, regulations, programs,

 systems  must  achieve in order to be authorized for use by law enforce-
 ment, and auditing requirements to ensure compliance with  those  stand-
 ards;
  (iv)  standards  for  use,  management,  and protection of information
 derived from the use of biometric surveillance systems by  law  enforce-
 ment, including, but not limited to data retention, sharing, access, and
 audit trails;
  (v)  rigorous  protections  for  due process, privacy, free speech and
 association, and racial, gender, and religious equity;
  (vi) training requirements for law enforcement personnel authorized to
 use biometric surveillance systems;
  (vii) procedures to address instances in which a person is  wrongfully
 targeted,  arrested  or  interrogated  based  on  inaccurate information

 to the governor, the temporary president of the senate, the  speaker  of
 the assembly, the minority leader of the senate, and the minority leader
 of  the  assembly,  the division of criminal justice services shall make
 such report available on its website.
  § 5. This act shall take effect  immediately,  provided  that  section
 four of this act shall expire and be deemed repealed 60 days after tran-
