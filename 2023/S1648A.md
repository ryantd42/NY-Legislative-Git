 Introduced  by Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the  Committee  on  Cultural  Affairs,
  Tourism,  Parks  and  Recreation  --  recommitted  to the Committee on
  Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and  Recreation  in  accordance  with
  Senate  Rule  6, sec. 8 -- committee discharged, bill amended, ordered
  reprinted as amended and recommitted to said committee
 
 AN ACT to amend the arts  and  cultural  affairs  law,  in  relation  to
  requiring  that  an  organization  applying  for  grant  funding shall
  provide to arts agencies a certification that it  will  enter  into  a
  labor  peace  agreement with at least one bona fide labor organization
  under certain circumstances; and to amend the labor law,  in  relation
  to prevailing wage requirement for not-for-profit theaters and payment
  of their employees on productions funded by the New York state council
  on the arts or arts agencies of localities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3.01 of  the  arts  and  cultural  affairs  law  is
 amended to read as follows:
  § 3.01. Legislative  findings  and declaration of policy. It is hereby
 found that many of our citizens lack the opportunity to view,  enjoy  or
 participate in living theatrical performances, musical concerts, operas,
 dance  and ballet recitals, art exhibits, examples of fine architecture,
 and the performing and fine arts generally. It is hereby  further  found
 that,  with  increasing  leisure time, the practice and enjoyment of the
 arts are of increasing importance and that the general  welfare  of  the
 people  of  the  state will be promoted by giving further recognition to
 the arts as a vital aspect of our culture and heritage and as  a  valued
 means of expanding the scope of our educational programs.
  It  is  hereby  declared  to  be  the policy of the state to join with
 private patrons and with  institutions  and  professional  organizations
 concerned  with the arts to insure that the role of the arts in the life

 of our communities will continue to grow and  will  play  an  ever  more
 significant  part in the welfare and educational experience of our citi-
 zens and in maintaining the paramount position  of  this  state  in  the
 nation and in the world as a cultural center.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER  FINDS  THAT THE INVESTMENT OF FUNDS BY ARTS
 AGENCIES AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE EIGHT-B OF THE LABOR LAW  CAN  PROVIDE  A
 VITAL  ECONOMIC ENGINE TO ASSIST, NURTURE, DEVELOP, AND PROMOTE REGIONAL
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE STATE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND THE GROWTH OF  JOBS
 IN  THE STATE.  INDEED, ATTENDEES OF ARTS PROGRAMMING GENERATE ECONOMIC
 ACTIVITY IN NEW YORK STATE FAR BEYOND THE COST OF ADMISSION,  FROM  FOOD
 AND  DRINK,  TO PARKING, TRANSPORTATION, TRAVEL, AND CHILDCARE REVENUES,
 AMONG OTHERS.
  THE PROFESSIONAL PERFORMERS AND RELATED  OR  SUPPORTING  PROFESSIONALS
 EMPLOYED ON PROJECTS AND PRODUCTIONS THAT CREATE THE PERFORMING AND FINE
 ARTS,  AND  ARE THE BASIS OF THE ARTS ECONOMY IN NEW YORK STATE AND MUST
 NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. THEREFORE, THE STATE  LEGISLATURE  FINDS  THAT  ARTS
 AGENCIES  HAVE  A SUBSTANTIAL AND COMPELLING PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN ANY
 FUNDS AWARDED IN THE FINE AND PERFORMING ARTS.  THE LEGISLATURE  HEREBY
 DECLARES  THAT  THE MANDATE OF A LIVING WAGE FOR PROJECTS AWARDED GRANTS
 BY ARTS AGENCIES IS CENTRAL TO ENSURING THE  CONTINUED  AVAILABILITY  OF
 THE  FINE  AND  PERFORMING  ARTS  IN NEW YORK STATE, AND THE CONCOMITANT
 ECONOMIC BENEFITS THEREWITH, AND FURTHER THAT  THE  STATE'S  PROPRIETARY
 INTEREST  WITH  REGARD  TO  SUCH  FUNDS  COULD  BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY
 LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONFLICT.
  It is further declared that all activities undertaken by the state  in
 carrying  out  this  policy  shall  be  directed  toward encouraging and
 assisting rather than in any  ways  limiting  the  freedom  of  artistic
 expression that is essential for the well-being of the arts.
  §  2.  Paragraph  (d) of subdivision 1 of section 3.19 of the arts and
 cultural affairs law, as added by chapter 16 of the  laws  of  2017,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (d) ANY ORGANIZATION APPLYING FOR GRANT FUNDING FROM AN ARTS AGENCY AS
 DEFINED BY THIS CHAPTER SHALL PROVIDE TO THE ARTS AGENCY A CERTIFICATION
 THAT  IT  WILL ENTER INTO A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT WITH AT LEAST ONE BONA
 FIDE LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES OF  SUCH  ORGANIZATION
 INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACTORS, STAGE MANAGERS, PRODUCTION ASSIST-
 ANTS, SCENIC ARTISTS,  SCENIC  DESIGNERS,  COSTUME  DESIGNERS,  LIGHTING
 DESIGNERS,  SOUND  DESIGNERS, PROJECTION DESIGNERS, GRAPHIC ARTISTS, ART
 AND COSTUME DEPARTMENT COORDINATORS, USHERS, TICKET TAKERS, LINE  DIREC-
 TORS, PRESS AGENTS, COMPANY MANAGERS, THEATRE MANAGERS, ENGINEERS, MUSI-
 CIANS,  SINGERS,  CHOREOGRAPHERS,  DANCERS, STAGING STAFF, BALLET SCHOOL
 FACULTY,  DIRECTORS,  FIGHT  DIRECTORS,  INTIMACY  DIRECTORS,  DRESSERS,
 WARDROBERS,  COSTUMERS,  STITCHERS,  TAILORS, DRAPERS, SHOPPERS, LAUNDRY
 WORKERS, DYERS,  COSTUME  TECHNICIANS,  MILLINERS,  CRAFTSPEOPLE,  CHILD
 ACTORS,  GUARDIANS,  BOX OFFICE TREASURERS, FIRST ASSISTANTS, AND TICKET
 SELLERS EITHER WHERE SUCH  BONA  FIDE  LABOR  ORGANIZATION  IS  ACTIVELY
 REPRESENTING  EMPLOYEES  PROVIDING  SERVICES COVERED BY THE ORGANIZATION
 SEEKING SUCH GRANT FUNDING OR UPON NOTICE BY A BONA FIDE LABOR ORGANIZA-
 TION THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO REPRESENT EMPLOYEES WHO WILL PROVIDE SERVICES
 TO THE ORGANIZATION SEEKING SUCH GRANT FUNDING.  THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH
 A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT SHALL  BE  AN  ONGOING  MATERIAL  CONDITION  FOR
 RECEIPT  OF  GRANT  FUNDING  UNDER  THIS ARTICLE.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
 SECTION, "LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT" MEANS AN AGREEMENT  BETWEEN  AN  ENTITY
 AND LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT, AT A MINIMUM, PROTECTS THE STATE'S PROPRIE-
 TARY  INTERESTS  BY  PROHIBITING  LABOR  ORGANIZATIONS  AND MEMBERS FROM
 S. 1648--A  3
 
 ENGAGING IN PICKETING, WORK STOPPAGES, BOYCOTTS, AND ANY OTHER  ECONOMIC
 INTERFERENCE WITH THE ENTITY.
  (E)  Any  applicant which fails to demonstrate that grant funds are to
 be used toward programs in the  state  shall  be  deemed  ineligible  to
 receive  grant funding under this article. Any organization, when apply-
 ing for grant funding, shall provide in its grant application  materials
 documentation demonstrating compliance with this provision.
