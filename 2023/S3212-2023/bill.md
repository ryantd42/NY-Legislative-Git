 MENT or sexual assault occurs may be hesitant to report  such  incidents

 vidual acting in good faith that  discloses  any  incident  of  domestic
 violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexual assault
 to  {Institution's}  officials or law enforcement will not be subject to
 {Institution's} code of conduct action for violations of alcohol  and/or

 domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexu-
 al assault."

 for information and assistance. Reports shall be investigated in accord-
 ance with institution policy and a reporting individual's identity shall
 remain private at all times if said reporting individual wishes to main-
 tain privacy;
  b. The right to a process in all student judicial  or  conduct  cases,
 where  a student is accused of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating
 violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexual activity that may other-
 wise violate the institution's code of  conduct,  that  includes,  at  a
 minimum:  (i) notice to a respondent describing the date, time, location
 and factual allegations concerning the violation,  a  reference  to  the
 specific  code  of conduct provisions alleged to have been violated, and
 possible sanctions; (ii) an opportunity  to  offer  evidence  during  an
 investigation, and to present evidence and testimony at a hearing, where
 appropriate, and have access to a full and fair record of any such hear-

 from such a hearing and may include a  transcript,  recording  or  other
 appropriate  record; and (iii) access to at least one level of appeal of
 a determination before a panel, which may include one or more  students,

 conflict of interest. In order to effectuate an appeal, a respondent and
 reporting individual in such cases shall receive written notice  of  the
 findings  of fact, the decision and the sanction, if any, as well as the
 rationale for the decision and  sanction.  In  such  cases,  any  rights
 provided  to  a  reporting  individual  must  be similarly provided to a

 ess. Rules for participation of such advisor shall be established in the

 manner by individuals who receive annual training in conducting investi-
 gations of sexual violence, the effects  of  trauma,  impartiality,  the
 rights  of the respondent, including the right to a presumption that the

 rently with a criminal justice investigation and proceeding, except  for
 temporary  delays  as requested by external municipal entities while law
 enforcement gathers evidence. Temporary delays should not last more than
 ten days except when law enforcement specifically requests and justifies
 a longer delay.

 otherwise  in the possession or control of the institution, and relevant
 to the conduct case, consistent with  institution  policies  and  proce-
 dures.

 al  assault  may be admissible in the disciplinary stage that determines
 sanction.

 attend,  of  the  specific  rule,  rules  or  laws  alleged to have been
 violated and in what manner, and the sanction or sanctions that  may  be
 imposed  on  the  respondent  based  upon the outcome of the judicial or
 conduct process, at which time the designated hearing  or  investigatory
 officer or panel shall provide a written statement detailing the factual
 findings supporting the determination and the rationale for the sanction
 imposed.
  viii.  To  make an impact statement during the point of the proceeding
 where the decision maker is deliberating on appropriate sanctions.

 cation  of  the  outcome of a judicial or conduct process, including the
 sanction or sanctions.

  c. how and where to report domestic violence, dating violence,  stalk-
 ing,  SEXUAL  HARASSMENT  or  sexual  assault  as  a victim, survivor or
 witness;
  e.  the  prevalence  of  victimization  and  perpetration  of domestic
 violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexual assault
 on and off campus during a set time period;
  § 7. Paragraphs a, b, d and g of subdivision 1 and  subdivision  2  of
 section 6446 of the education law, as added by chapter 76 of the laws of
 2015, are amended to read as follows:
  a.  Information  regarding  privileged and confidential resources they
 may contact regarding  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  stalking,
 SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexual assault;
  b. Information about counselors and advocates they may contact regard-
 ing  domestic  violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASSMENT or
 sexual assault;
  d. Information about how the institution shall  weigh  a  request  for
 confidentiality  and  respond to such a request. Such information shall,
 at a minimum, include that if a reporting individual discloses an  inci-
 dent  to an institution employee who is responsible for responding to or
 reporting domestic violence, dating violence, stalking,  SEXUAL  HARASS-
 MENT  or  sexual  assault but wishes to maintain confidentiality or does
 not consent to the institution's request to initiate  an  investigation,
 the  Title  IX  Coordinator  must  weigh  the request against the insti-
 tution's obligation to provide a  safe,  non-discriminatory  environment
 for  all  members  of  its  community. The institution shall assist with
 academic, housing, transportation, employment, and other reasonable  and
 available accommodations regardless of reporting choices;
  g.  Information regarding institutional crime reporting including, but
 not  limited  to:  reports  of  certain  crimes  occurring  in  specific
 geographic  locations that shall be included in the institution's annual
 security report pursuant to the Clery Act,  20  U.S.C.  1092(f),  in  an
 anonymized manner that identifies neither the specifics of the crime nor
 the  identity of the reporting individual; that the institution is obli-
 gated to issue timely warnings of crimes enumerated  in  the  Clery  Act
 occurring within relevant geography that represent a serious or continu-
 ing  threat  to  students  and  employees, except in those circumstances
 where issuing such a warning  may  compromise  current  law  enforcement
 efforts  or  when  the  warning  itself  could  potentially identify the
 reporting individual; that a reporting individual shall not  be  identi-
 fied in a timely warning; that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
 Act,  20  U.S.C.  1232g,  allows  institutions to share information with
 parents when i. there is a health or safety emergency, or ii.  when  the
 student  is a dependent on either parent's prior year federal income tax
 return; and that generally, the institution shall not share  information
 about  a  report of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL
 HARASSMENT or sexual assault with parents without the permission of  the
 reporting individual.
  2.  The  institution  may  take  proactive  steps, such as training or
 awareness efforts, to combat domestic violence, dating violence,  stalk-
 ing,  SEXUAL HARASSMENT or sexual assault in a general way that does not
 identify those who disclose or the information disclosed.

 sions 4, 5 and 6 of section 6447 of the education law, as added by chap-
 ter 76 of the laws of 2015, are amended to read as follows:

 about violence  prevention  and  shall  share  information  on  domestic
 violence,  dating  violence,  stalking,  SEXUAL  HARASSMENT  and  sexual
 assault prevention with parents of enrolling students.
  5. Every institution shall offer to all students general and  specific
 training in domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, SEXUAL HARASS-
 MENT  and  sexual  assault  prevention and shall conduct a campaign that
 complies with the Violence Against Women  Act,  20  U.S.C.  1092(f),  to
 educate  the  student population. They shall, as appropriate, provide or
 expand  specific  training  to  include  groups  such  as  international
 students,  students  that  are  also  employees, leaders and officers of
 registered or recognized student organizations, and online and  distance
 education students. They shall also provide specific training to members

 cer of student organizations recognized by or registered with the insti-
 tution, as  well  as  those  seeking  recognition  by  the  institution,

 AL  HARASSMENT  or sexual assault prevention prior to receiving recogni-
 tion or registration, and  each  institution  shall  require  that  each
 student-athlete complete training on domestic violence, dating violence,
 stalking,  SEXUAL  HARASSMENT  or  sexual  assault  prevention  prior to
 participating in intercollegiate athletic competition.
