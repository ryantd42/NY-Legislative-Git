 benchmark premium amount established by the federal centers for medicare
 and medicaid services and any other amount which such agency establishes
 under its de minimus premium policy.
  (h)  The  elderly pharmaceutical insurance coverage program is author-
 ized to represent program participants under this title with respect  to
 their Medicare part D OR COMPARABLE coverage.
