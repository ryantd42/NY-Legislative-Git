  men in New York state
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Legislative intent.  The  legislature  finds  that  African
 American  men:  (a)  are disproportionately less likely to complete high
 school and to obtain a post-secondary education; (b) are more likely  to
 be incarcerated or on parole; (c) are more likely to have lower lifetime
 economic  earnings; (d) are more likely to have been a part of the child
 welfare population; (e) are more likely to have a shorter life expectan-
 cy; and (f) are more likely to have health problems, such  as  HIV/AIDS,
 drug  dependency,  heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. The legislature
 additionally finds that the state of New York has a compelling  interest
 in  determining the causes of these problems and in developing appropri-
 ate remedies.
  § 2. The New York state task force on the condition of African  Ameri-
 can  men  is hereby established. The role of the task force includes but
 is not limited to:
  (a) assessing the causal factors for the condition of African American
 men;
  (b) assessing state programs and initiatives that serve to improve the
 condition of African American men  and  identifying  the  gaps  in  such
 services;
  (c)  developing  strategies  to  reduce duplication of services and to
 maximize coordination between state agencies, providers and  educational
 institutions, including developing benchmarks to measure progress; and
  (d) preparing a report for submission to the governor and the legisla-
 ture  that  provides  specific  recommendations regarding existing state
