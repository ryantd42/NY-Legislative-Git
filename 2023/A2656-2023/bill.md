  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph (B)  of  paragraph  4  of  subsection  (b)  of
 section  4328 of the insurance law, as amended by chapter 11 of the laws
 of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  (B) In addition to the enrollment periods required in subparagraph (A)
 of this  paragraph,  an  individual  enrollee  direct  payment  contract
 offered  pursuant  to  this  section shall allow for the enrollment of a
 pregnant individual. Such individual may enroll  at  any  time  after  a
 health  care professional licensed pursuant to title eight of the educa-
 tion law and acting within the scope of his or  her  practice  certifies
 that  the  individual  is  pregnant.  SUCH  HEALTH  INSURANCE  POLICY OR
 CONTRACT SHALL NOT IMPOSE A FEE OR OTHER PENALTY FOR SPECIAL  ENROLLMENT
 OF  THE  PREGNANT INDIVIDUAL.  Upon enrollment, coverage shall be effec-
 tive as of the first day of the month in which the health  care  profes-
 sional  certifies that the individual is pregnant, unless the individual
 elects to have coverage effective on the first day of the month  follow-
 ing  the date that the individual received certification of the pregnan-
 cy.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing  the date on which it shall have become a law and shall apply to all
 policies or contracts issued, renewed, modified, altered or  amended  on
 or  after  such  effective  date.  Effective immediately, the addition,
 amendment and/or repeal of any rule  or  regulation  necessary  for  the
 implementation  of  this  act on its effective date are authorized to be
 made and completed on or before such effective date.
