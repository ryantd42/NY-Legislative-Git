  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 750  of  the  correction  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  284  of  the  laws  of 2007, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (3) "Direct  relationship"  means  that  THERE  IS  AN  IMMEDIATE  AND
 SUBSTANTIAL  CONNECTION  BETWEEN  the  nature  of [criminal conduct] THE
 CRIME for which the person was convicted [has a direct  bearing  on  his
 fitness  or ability to perform one or more of] AND the duties or respon-
 sibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity,  or  job  in
 question  AND SUCH CONNECTION WOULD CREATE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO PROP-
 ERTY OR TO THE SAFETY OR WELFARE OF SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR THE  GENERAL
 PUBLIC UPON THE ISSUANCE OR CONTINUATION OF A LICENSE OR THE GRANTING OR
 CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYMENT OF SUCH PERSON.

 license or employment, and no employment or license held by an  individ-
 ual,  to  which  the provisions of this article are applicable, shall be
 denied or acted upon adversely by reason of the individual's having been
 previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a
 finding of lack of "good moral character" when  such  finding  is  based

  (1)]  there  is a direct relationship, AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION THREE
 OF SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY OF THIS ARTICLE, between one or  more  of
 the  previous  criminal  offenses and the specific license or employment
 sought or held by the individual[; or
  (2) the issuance or continuation of the license  or  the  granting  or
 continuation  of  the  employment  would involve an unreasonable risk to
 property or to the safety or welfare  of  specific  individuals  or  the
 general public].
  2.  NO  PUBLIC  OR  PRIVATE EMPLOYER TO WHICH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
 ARTICLE ARE APPLICABLE, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY  REQUIRED  OR  PERMITTED  BY

 BASED  UPON,  ANY  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION  OF  SUCH INDIVIDUAL UNLESS SUCH
 EMPLOYER FIRST MAKES A CONDITIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT TO SUCH  INDIVID-
 UAL. SUCH CONDITIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT MAY ONLY SUBSEQUENTLY BE WITH-
 DRAWN  ON  THE  BASIS  OF  A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
 ARTICLE WHERE SUCH CONVICTION BEARS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE SPECIF-

 CONVICTION  OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL UNLESS SUCH EMPLOYER FIRST MAKES A CONDI-
 TIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL. SUCH CONDITIONAL OFFER OF

 CONVICTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE-A OF  THE  CORRECTION
