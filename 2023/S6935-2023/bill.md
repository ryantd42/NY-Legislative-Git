 erly carry out its powers and duties hereunder.
  6. The task force shall undertake a review of the actions and measures
 that  are  needed  to  ensure  safe,  adequate,  efficient, and reliable
 freight rail transportation and make recommendations regarding:
  a. enhanced coordination between the federal, state, and local regula-

 information related to freight rail trains and their  operators  includ-

 other metrics that can help prevent catastrophic incidents;
  b. the establishment and adoption of a uniform safety training program

  c. a review of federal laws and rules as they relate to the regulation
 of  freight rail operations and operators, including but not limited to,

 oversight by the state; and
  d. the need for additional freight rail safety measures.
