 THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE OF THIS ARTICLE AND HOMEOWNERS POLICIES.

 ASSOCIATION'S  RELATED  LOSS  AND EXPENSE EXPERIENCE TOGETHER WITH OTHER

 APPROVED  BY  THE  SUPERINTENDENT.  EACH MEMBER'S SHARE OF THE ESTIMATED

 A. 2824  6
 
  (D)  IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, THE DEFICIT

 EARNED DURING THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECU-
 RITY FUND. ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF INCOME AND THE
 ACTUAL AMOUNT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR SHALL  BE  TAKEN  INTO  ACCOUNT  IN
 COMPUTING  THE ESTIMATE FOR THE NEXT PERIOD. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGO-
 ING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION OR ANY OTHER LAW TO THE CONTRARY, IF  THE
 ASSETS OF THE ASSOCIATION EXCEED ITS LIABILITIES ON THE THIRTIETH DAY OF
 NOVEMBER  IN  ANY  YEAR  COMMENCING  ON  OR  AFTER APRIL FIRST, NINETEEN
 HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT,
 THE ASSOCIATION SHALL PAY TO THE NEW  YORK  PROPERTY/CASUALTY  INSURANCE
 SECURITY  FUND AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ANY AMOUNTS PAID FROM SUCH FUND TO THE

 REPLACEMENT COST BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE WINDSTORM COVERAGE CONTAINED  IN
 AN  ASSOCIATION  POLICY  ISSUED TO THE SAME POLICYHOLDER. THE PURPOSE OF
 THESE INCENTIVES SHALL BE TO ENCOURAGE THE WRITING OF  VOLUNTARY  INSUR-
 ANCE  POLICIES  IN  COASTAL  AREAS  BY REDUCING THE PARTICIPATION IN THE
 WRITINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF THOSE MEMBER COMPANIES WHICH  VOLUNTARILY
 WRITE  POLICIES  THAT  INCLUDE WINDSTORM COVERAGE IN SUCH AREAS. FOR THE

 PERSONAL  PROPERTY,  AND  SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO COVER ONE TO FOUR FAMILY

 OF FLOOD INSURANCE AS A CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR COVERAGE UNDER THIS
 POLICY. THE ASSOCIATION SHALL FILE THE FORM FOR APPROVAL WITH THE SUPER-
 INTENDENT.

 "PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE" HAVE THE MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO THEM BY
 SECTION ONE HUNDRED SEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER,  EXCEPT  THAT  MOTOR  VEHICLE
 INSURANCE  AND MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LIABILITY INSURANCE ARE EXCLUDED FROM

  (2) "MARKET" MEANS A LINE, SUBLINE OR  CLASSIFICATION  (OTHER  THAN  A
 CLASSIFICATION  DELINEATED  BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION) OF PROPERTY/CASUALTY
