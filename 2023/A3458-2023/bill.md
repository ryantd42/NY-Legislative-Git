  Section 1. Subparagraph (i) of paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision  2  and

 laws of 2014, are amended to read as follows:
  (i)  The exemption from taxation provided by this subdivision shall be
 applicable to county, city, town, village and school  district  taxation
 [if  the  governing body of the school district in which the property is
 located, or in the case of a city with a population of  one  million  or
 more, the local legislative body, after public hearings, adopts a resol-
 ution,  or  in  the  case  of a city with a population of one million or
 more, a local law, providing such  exemption,  the  procedure  for  such
 hearing  and  resolution or local law shall be conducted separately from

 vision  four,  paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision  six and paragraph (b) of

 or after the thirty-first day of December nineteen hundred  eighty-four,

 village.  For  the  purposes of a county which is not an assessing unit,
 the taxable status date next occurring  on  or  after  December  thirty-
 first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four shall mean the first such taxable
 status  date  of any city or town within such county upon the assessment
 roll of which the county levies taxes. A local law adopted  pursuant  to
 this  paragraph may be repealed by the governing board of the applicable
 county, city, town or village. Such repeal must occur  at  least  ninety
 days  prior  to  the  taxable  status date of such county, city, town or
 village.

 governing  body  of  a  school  district may repeal a resolution adopted
 pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (d) of subdivision two of this
 section providing the exemption from taxation pursuant to  this  section
 for  the  purposes  of  taxes  levied  by  such school district. Nothing
 contained in this paragraph shall be construed to preclude the governing
 body of a school district from subsequently adopting a resolution grant-
 ing such exemption pursuant to this section.]
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to assess-
 ment rolls prepared on or after January 1, 2024.
