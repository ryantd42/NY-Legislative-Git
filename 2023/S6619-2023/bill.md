 AN  ACT  to amend the village law, in relation to exempting fire depart-
  ment officers of the Village of Hancock fire  department  from  a  New
  York state residency requirement

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 10-1012 of  the  village  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  481  of  the  laws  of 2015, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The chief and the first and second assistant chiefs and such  addi-
 tional  assistant  chiefs, if any, as may be provided for in the by-laws
 of the fire department shall each be a member thereof and a resident  of
 the  state of New York; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFICERS
 OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF THE VILLAGE OF HANCOCK, DELAWARE COUNTY,  NEED
 NOT  BE  RESIDENTS  OF  THE STATE OF NEW YORK. In addition, the board of
 trustees, or the board of fire commissioners subject to the approval  of
 the  board  of  trustees, may, by resolution, require that any or all of
 such fire department officers shall be residents  of  the  village.  The
 delegates elected to the general convention of the fire department shall
 meet  at  the  council  room thereof on the Thursday following the first
 Tuesday in April, except the elected delegates of the fire department of
 the village of Fishkill, Dutchess county, which shall meet on the  first
 Tuesday in December, and nominate a person for each of such offices; but
 the  fire  commissioners  of  any village may adopt a rule requiring all
 such nominations to be made on the day of the meeting by a vote  of  the
 duly  qualified  members of the department, in which case the meeting of
 the delegates in general convention, as provided for  in  this  section,
 shall  be dispensed with. The person acting as secretary of such conven-
 tion shall forthwith file in the office of the village clerk  a  certif-
 icate  of  such nominations. The board of fire commissioners at its next

 meeting shall consider the nominations and appoint such persons  to  the
 offices  to which they are respectively nominated or, if a nomination is
 not approved the board shall reconvene  the  general  convention,  which
 shall  submit  a  new nomination to take the place of any nomination not
 approved, which procedure shall continue until a full set of officers is
 approved. A person who has been convicted of arson in any  degree  shall
 not be eligible for nomination, election or appointment to the office of
 chief  or  assistant  chief.  Any  fire  chief or assistant chief who is
 convicted of arson in any degree during his  term  of  office  shall  be
 disqualified from completing such term of office.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
