 Introduced  by M. of A. ANGELINO, BRABENEC, DeSTEFANO, LEMONDES, MANKTE-
  LOW, McDONOUGH, MILLER, NORRIS  --  read  once  and  referred  to  the
  Committee on Small Business
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the economic development law, in relation to directing
  the department of economic development to study the attrition of small
  retail businesses from the state and create a pilot  program  to  help
  maintain  the  existence  of  small businesses within the state and to
  train and counsel small business owners and potential  small  business
  owners; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the number
 of small businesses located  within  the  boundaries  of  the  state  is
 decreasing  at a rapid pace. In today's market place, the small business
 owner struggles to compete with the large corporate chain stores.  The
 legislature  further  finds that the existence of these small businesses
 within the state is crucial toward  the  strengthening  of  the  state's
 economy.  Therefore, it is imperative that steps be taken to help ensure
 the future existence and stability of these small businesses.
  § 2. The department of economic  development  is  hereby  directed  to
 conduct  a  comprehensive  study relating to the ability to retain small
 retail businesses within the state  and  is  further  directed  to  make
 recommendations  in  accordance  with  its  findings.  Such  study shall
 include, but not be limited to:
  1. The economic feasibility to grant money to communities to establish
 small retail business retention and development plans.
  2. The possibility of subsidizing, either in whole or in part,  retail
 entrepreneur education programs for small business owners throughout the
 state.

  3.  The use of tax credits, both income and property, for small retail
 business owners to lessen  their  financial  burden  and  to  help  them
 compete with the highly funded corporation.
  4.  The  possibility of implementing legislation guaranteeing loans to
 small retail business owners at a low, fixed interest rate.
  5. The economic feasibility to grant money to  small  retail  business
 owners for the upgrade of certain equipment.
  6.  The  ability  to  create  a small business incentive program. Such
 program would:
  a. require small retail business owners participating in  the  program
 to  commit  to  a five year program consisting of entrepreneur education
 classes, management training, and consultations with financial advisors.
  b. be devised so as to create incentives for banking  institutions  to
 participate  in  the  growth  and  production  of new and existing small
 retail businesses.
  § 3. A report of the findings of such study, recommendations, and  any
 proposed  legislation  necessary to implement such recommendations shall
 be filed with the governor, the temporary president of the  senate,  and
 the  speaker of the assembly within one year after the effective date of
 this act.
  § 4. The economic development law is amended by adding a  new  section
 139-a to read as follows:

 NESS OWNER TRAINING PILOT PROGRAM.
  2.  APPROVAL AND TERMS OF SPONSORS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND POTEN-
 TIAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER PROGRAMS. THE WRITTEN APPROVAL OF A  SPONSOR'S
