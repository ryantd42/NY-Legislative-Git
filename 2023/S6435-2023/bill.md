 Introduced  by  Sens.  WEBER, ROLISON -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the transportation law, in  relation  to  penalties  for
  individuals,  corporations,  companies,  and associations that violate
  rules and regulations related to braking systems, steering components,
  coupling devices, and the transportation of hazardous  materials;  and
  to repeal certain provisions of such law relating thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  In  response  to  recent
 events  in  Rockland  County  that caused massive damage and the Norfolk
 Southern derailment that released flammable chemicals  into  surrounding
 areas  of  East Palestine, Ohio, it is imperative to protect New Yorkers
 from the disastrous effects of train accidents. Railroad companies  must
 ensure  that  their  trains  are safe before they drive them through our
 communities and minimize the risk to the  citizens  they  roll  by.  The
 legislature  finds  that  it  is  critical  to  hold rail companies that
 woefully act in a negligent manner  accountable  for  the  personal  and
 environmental harm that they cause.
  § 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 4 of section 14-f of the transporta-
 tion  law  is  REPEALED  and  a  new  paragraph  (b) is added to read as
 follows:

 LATIONS  INVOLVING  AN  OUT-OF-SERVICE DEFECT RELATING TO BRAKE SYSTEMS,
 STEERING COMPONENTS AND/OR COUPLING DEVICES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO  A  FINE
 OF  NO MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, BY IMPRISONMENT FOR NOT MORE THAN
 SIXTY DAYS, OR BY BOTH SUCH FINE  AND  IMPRISONMENT.  UPON  BEING  FOUND
 GUILTY  OF  A  SECOND  OR  SUBSEQUENT  OFFENSE COMMITTED WITHIN EIGHTEEN
 MONTHS, A FINE OF NOT LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND FIVE  HUNDRED  DOLLARS  NOR
 MORE  THAN  TWO  THOUSAND  FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS, BY IMPRISONMENT FOR NOT
