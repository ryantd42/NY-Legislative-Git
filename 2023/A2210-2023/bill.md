 ensure the most appropriate response to, and treatment  of,  individuals
 experiencing  crisis  due  to  mental  health conditions, alcohol use or
 substance use conditions; and to deescalate crisis situations so that as
 few New Yorkers as possible experience nonconsensual transport,  use  of
 force,  or  criminal  consequences as a result of mental health, alcohol
 use or substance abuse crises.
  § 3. Section 41.01 of the mental hygiene law, as amended by chapter 37
