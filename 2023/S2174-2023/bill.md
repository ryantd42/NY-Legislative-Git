 SECTION, THERE is hereby levied and imposed with respect to Diesel motor

 Diesel motor fuel in this state.
  The excise tax is imposed on the first sale or  use  of  Diesel  motor
 fuel to occur which is not exempt from tax under this article. Provided,
 however,  if  the  tax  has  not been imposed prior thereto, it shall be
 imposed on the removal of highway Diesel motor  fuel  from  a  terminal,
 other  than  by pipeline, barge, tanker or other vessel, or the delivery

 whichever event shall be first to occur. The tax shall be computed based
 upon the number of gallons of Diesel motor fuel sold, removed or used or
 the  number  of gallons of Diesel fuel delivered into the fuel tank of a
 motor vehicle, as the case may be. Nothing  in  this  article  shall  be
 construed  to require the payment of such excise tax more than once upon
 the same Diesel motor fuel. Nor shall the collection of such tax be made
