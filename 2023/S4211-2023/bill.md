 presence of such a person therein a reasonable possibility; OR

 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of  the  penal  law,  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, or any charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  firearm  as

 released on his or her own recognizance or under  appropriate  non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
  (u)  criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined in
