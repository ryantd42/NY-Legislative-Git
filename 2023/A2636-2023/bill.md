 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  COLTON,  BENEDETTO,  RIVERA, L. ROSENTHAL --
  Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. GLICK, THIELE, WALKER -- read once  and
  referred to the Committee on Local Governments
 
 AN ACT to enact the "wireless facility siting act"; to amend the general
  municipal  law, in relation to the placement, construction and modifi-
  cation of wireless services facilities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent.  Municipal control over the siting of
 wireless services facilities is an important component of municipal home
 rule.  The legislature recognizes the federal, state and local interests
 of providing for proper and convenient wireless services to the  public.
 As  such,  the  legislature  needs to balance the interests of providing
 quality wireless communication services with local concerns on the inap-
 propriate siting of telecommunications towers. This act provides  for  a
 process  of  municipal  review  for  applications to site, construct and
 modify wireless services facilities.  Such process must incorporate  the
 needs  and  desires of the local community, with regard to the aesthetic
 ramifications of such siting. It is the intent  of  the  legislature  in
 adopting the "wireless facility siting act" to implement enabling legis-
 lation  which  specifically  sets  forth a uniform statewide process for
 municipal review of applications for  the  placement,  construction  and
 modification  of wireless services facilities in all municipalities that
 do not have local laws to regulate the placement of  such  towers.  Each
 municipality  shall  be  able  to enact approval processes that are more
 strict than those established by this act.
  § 2. Short title. This act shall be known as and may be cited  as  the
 "wireless facility siting act".
  § 3. The general municipal law is amended by adding a new article 13-E
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 13-E
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
