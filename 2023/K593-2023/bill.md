  HONORING  Elizabeth  Mae Maxwell upon the occasion
  of her designation for special  recognition  at  the
  Chestertown  Firehouse  for her prompt actions while
  at the scene of a medical emergency on May 25, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
recognize  and  acknowledge  those  within  our  midst  who  have  made
significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
caring concern and heroic acts of exemplary citizens who take prompt and
appropriate action in emergency situations, and in doing so, help others
to avert life-threatening danger; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Elizabeth  Mae  Maxwell upon the occasion of her designation for special
recognition at the Chestertown Firehouse for her prompt actions while at
the scene of a medical emergency on May 25, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell will be  recognized  for  her  heroic
acts on Friday, June 2, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At approximately 5:45 pm, on Wednesday, May 25, 2022, then
18-year-old Elizabeth Mae Maxwell and  her  friend  Viviana  Bravo  were
driving  on  the  Adirondack State Northway between exits 15 and 16 when
they noticed a truck swerving in between the lanes in front of them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Peter and Susan Michalski were also driving along the  road
when he suddenly lost consciousness; after Susan was able to safely pull
the  vehicle  over  to  the  side of the road, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell and
Viviana Bravo also pulled over and immediately called 911 before running
over to help the couple; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon their arrival, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell and Viviana Bravo
quickly  noticed  Susan  Michalski  was  panicking  because  Peter  was
unconscious  and had stopped breathing; without regard for their safety,
the two teenagers opened the car door, pulled Peter out of the  driver's
seat,  carefully  placed  him on the ground, and began to perform CPR on
him, the first time they had done so on a human being; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shortly thereafter, the Wilton EMS arrived on the scene and
took over with an AED to continue life-saving  measures;  the  two  good
samaritans  stayed with Susan Michalski to comfort her and pray with her
while EMS was working on Peter; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thanks to the swift and lifesaving actions of Elizabeth Mae
Maxwell and Viviana Bravo, Peter Michalski recovered from a  ventricular
fibrillation  event  after  spending  10  weeks  in  several  medical
facilities, and was able to continue  his  life  as  a  loving  husband,
father, and grampy to his six grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  graduating from North Warren Central School in June
of 2022, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell is majoring  in  Culinary  Arts  at  SUNY
Adirondack; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Elizabeth  Mae Maxwell, through her spontaneous and heroic
actions, demonstrated her character and her compassion for  the  welfare
of  others,  personifying,  by  virtue  of  her  actions, the collective
concern of ordinary citizens across the community of the  State  of  New
York  who  voluntarily  respond  when  others  are in need of help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Elizabeth  Mae  Maxwell  upon the occasion of her designation for
special recognition at the Chestertown Firehouse for her prompt  actions
while  at  the  scene  of a medical emergency on May 25, 2022; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Elizabeth Mae Maxwell.
