  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its

observance of National Caribbean-American Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago, the sounds
of the steel pan have always been synonymous with Caribbean culture, and
is a source of great pride and true resilience for all its citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  enslaved  Africans  were  brought  to  Trinidad  by
colonialists  in the 1700s, they brought over their African heritage and

Orchestra  (TASPO) performed at the Festival of Britain, and in doing so
introduced the steel pan and a new music  genre  to  the  world;  today,
steel pans are enjoyed in concert halls like Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie
Hall,  the  Kennedy  Center,  and  more;  whether in the United Kingdom,
Japan,  Senegal,  or  the  United  States,  the  steel  pan  is  an
internationally  recognized  instrument  that  reminds  listeners of its
island origins; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steel Pan Day was established in 2015  to  acknowledge  the
impact  of  the  steel  pan,  the  only  instrument invented in the 20th
Century, which has greatly contributed to the music and culture  of  the
Caribbean people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Declared  by Pan Trinbago, World Steelpan Day is on August
11th of every year; Steel Pan Day will  be  celebrated  during  National
Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month in Prospect Park with caribBEING and
Prospect Park Alliance; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  2017,  caribBEING  spearheaded  the  naming  of  Little
Caribbean  to  recognize,  celebrate  and  foster  the  contributions of
Caribbean-Americans in New York City and the neighborhood  of  Flatbush,
Brooklyn, as a center for culture, community and commerce; and
 
  WHEREAS,  caribBEING  is  an  inclusive hub for creativity featuring
artists and  makers  from  Cuba,  Guyana,  Haiti,  Guadeloupe,  Grenada,
Jamaica,  Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Martinique, France,
Canada and others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  caribBEING  is  a  multidisciplinary  venture dedicated to
show-casing Caribbean culture, art, and film in Greater  New  York  City
and  around  the  world,  where  art,  culture and lifestyle meet global
Caribbean and LatinX heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital  organization  celebrates  and
amplifies  Caribbean  culture  and  lifestyle,  supporting  businesses,
creating community, and documenting as well as creating culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is pleased to have  this  opportunity
to  recognize  such events of significance which foster ethnic pride and
exemplify the cultural diversity that  represents  and  strengthens  the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize June 28, 2023, as Steel  Pan  Day,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance  of  National  Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month; and be it
