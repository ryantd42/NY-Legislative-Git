 of any other law, in a city of one million or more, where a majority  of
 laborers,  workmen  or mechanics in a particular civil service title are
 members of an employee organization which has been certified  or  recog-
 nized  to  represent them pursuant to the provisions of article fourteen
 of the civil service law or a local law enacted thereunder,  the  public
 employer  and  such  employee organization shall in good faith negotiate
 and enter into a written agreement with respect to the wages and supple-

 fail to achieve an agreement, only the employee  organization  shall  be
 authorized  to  file a single verified complaint pursuant to subdivision
 seven herein, on behalf of the laborers, workmen or mechanics so repres-

 sentative of such laborers, workmen or mechanics at any hearing pursuant
 to subdivision eight herein, and shall be the sole  complainant  in  the
 proceeding  for all purposes therein, including review pursuant to arti-
 cle seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.  Service by  the
 fiscal  officer  on the employee organization shall be sufficient notice
 to the laborers, workmen or mechanics so represented for all purposes of
 subdivision eight herein, except that the issuance  and  enforcement  of
 subpoenas  shall  be  regulated by the civil practice law and rules. Any

 subdivision.
  (B) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE PHRASE "LABORERS, WORKMEN OR
 MECHANICS" SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, EMPLOYEES OF  A  PUBLIC
