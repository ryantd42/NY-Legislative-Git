  Section 1. Section 27  of  the  transportation  corporations  law,  as

 follows:
  § 27. Construction of  lines.  1.  Any  such  corporation  may  erect,
 construct  and  maintain the necessary fixtures for its lines upon, over
 or under any of the public roads, streets  and  highways;  and  through,
 across  or  under any of the waters within the limits of this state, and
 may erect, construct and maintain its necessary stations, plants, equip-
 ment or lines upon, through or over any other land, subject to the right
 of the owners thereof to full compensation for the  same.  If  any  such
 corporation  can  not  agree  with such owner or owners upon the compen-
 sation to be paid therefor, such compensation shall  be  ascertained  in
 the manner provided in the eminent domain procedure law. Any such corpo-
 ration  is  authorized, from time to time, to construct and lay lines of
 electrical conductors under ground in any city, village or  town  within
 the limits of this state, subject to all the provisions of law in refer-
 ence to such companies not inconsistent with this section; provided that
 such corporation shall, before laying any such line in any city, village
 or  town  of this state, first obtain from the common council of cities,
 or  other  body  having  like  jurisdiction  therein,  the  trustees  of
 villages,  or  the  town superintendents of towns, permission to use the
 streets within such city, village or town for the  purposes  herein  set
 forth.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  limit,  alter,  or affect the
 provisions or powers relating or granted to telegraph corporations here-

 CITY'S  CHARTER) FOR THE USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY TO PROVIDE INFORMA-
 TION SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  TERMS  OF  SUCH  CITY'S  CHARTER
 REGARDING SUCH FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS OR REVOCABLE CONSENT AGREEMENTS SUCH

 IN  NO  EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL COMPENSATION AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY
 ANY ENTITY THAT HOLDS A CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE AGREEMENT EXCEED  THE
 MAXIMUM  AMOUNT,  WITH RESPECT TO LINES WHICH ARE USED FOR THE PROVISION
 OF CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE, PERMITTED TO BE CHARGED UNDER FEDERAL LAW.
