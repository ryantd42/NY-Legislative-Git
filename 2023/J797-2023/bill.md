Brian  S.  Waterson  upon  the  occasion  of his designation for special
recognition after many years of dedicated service to the Port Washington

  WHEREAS,  Brian S. Waterson has consistently demonstrated a level of

exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the Port Washington Fire Department since 1996,
