BY: Senator CLEARE
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  196th  Anniversary  of  the
  Abolition of Slavery in the State  of  New  York  on
  July 5, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to commemorate
significant events which represent turning points in our unique  history
and which are indelibly etched in the saga of our great Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  196th  Anniversary  of the Abolition of Slavery in the
State of New York to be observed on Wednesday, July 5, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1799, an Act for the Gradual Abolition  of  Slavery  was
enacted  in  the  State  of New York, specifying that children born to a
slave mother after July 4, 1799, were declared  legally  free,  but  not
until  male  children  had turned 28, and females 25; slaves born before
that date  remained  in  servitude,  although  they  were  redefined  as
indentured servants; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 31, 1817, the New York State Legislature ended two
centuries  of  slavery  within its borders, setting July 4, 1827, as the
date of final emancipation and making New York the first state to pass a
law for the total abolition of legal slavery; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1821, the New York Constitutional Convention was  called
to  extend  universal  suffrage  across  the  State,  and it did abolish
property qualifications  for  white  men,  but  at  the  same  time  the
convention  delegates  disenfranchised  the  states'  African  American
citizens, including those to be freed in 1827, by limiting the right  to
vote by free black men to those who owned substantial property; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  July  4, 1827, Governor Daniel Tompkins finally signed
legislation abolishing slavery in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, This historic law freed approximately 4,600 or 11%  of  the
black  population  living  in  New  York;  the  black  community and its
supporters  celebrated  Emancipation  Day  and  the  following  day,
approximately  3,000 people gathered at St. John's Park in New York City
to herald the new law; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the threat of racist violence, African American  New
Yorkers  later  chose  to celebrate the emancipation day on July 5th for
many  years;  after  1834,  the  tradition  largely  merged  into  local
commemorations  of  the August 1 Emancipation Day in the British Empire,
first observed in New York in 1838 as part of a growing national embrace
among African Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2020, through the support of the New York branch of  the
Association  for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH),
the holiday was revived and recognized by  the  State  as  an  Abolition
Commemoration Day observed on the second Monday in July; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body to commemorate
events of significance in the history  and  progress  of  society;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 196th Anniversary of the Abolition  of  Slavery  in  the
State of New York on July 5, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the New York branch of the Association for the  Study  of
African American Life and History (ASALH).
