  This bill would change the allowable overtime compensation included in
 the final average salary calculation beginning January 1, 2025 to thirty
 percent of a member's annual wages if greater than the limits  currently
 defined  in  Section  601  of the Retirement and Social Security Law for
 Tier 5 and Tier 6 Westchester County correction officers. Current limits
 were set at $15,000 at the inception of each tier, with the Tier 5 limit
 increasing  3%  annually  and  the Tier 6 limit increasing annually with
 inflation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $500,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  the County of Westchester for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of the affected members change but is  expected  to
 average 0.8% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $3.05 million which will
 be  borne by the County of Westchester as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If the Coun-
 ty of Westchester elects to amortize this cost over  a  10-year  period,
 the cost for each year including interest would be $389,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on 523 affected Tier 5 and Tier 6
 correction officers employed by the County of Westchester,  with  annual
 salary of approximately $51.9 million as of March 31, 2023.
