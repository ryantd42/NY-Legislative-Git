 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  prohibiting the release of certain balloons
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature  finds  that  the
 release  of  large quantities of helium-filled balloons result in litter
 on land and at sea; that sea mammals and  other  marine  life  die  upon
 ingesting  deflated  balloons;  that growing public awareness concerning
 pollution has had the salutary effect of  causing  the  cancellation  of
 several celebratory and promotional launches of balloons; and that plac-
 ing  statutory  limitations  on  the  quantity  of  balloons that may be
 launched will reduce litter and protect the ocean environment, and is in
 the public interest.
  § 2. The environmental conservation law is amended by adding  two  new
 sections 11-0331 and 71-0929 to read as follows:
 § 11-0331. RELEASE OF CERTAIN BALLOONS PROHIBITED.
  1.  NO  BUSINESS,  FIRM, CORPORATION OR ASSOCIATION SHALL KNOWINGLY OR
 INTENTIONALLY RELEASE OR CAUSE TO BE  RELEASED  AT  ANY  SINGLE  OUTDOOR
 CELEBRATION, PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, SPORTING OR OTHER PUBLIC EVENT WITHIN
 A  TWENTY-FOUR  HOUR PERIOD MORE THAN TEN BALLOONS FILLED WITH HELIUM OR
 OTHER SUBSTANCE WHICH CAUSES THE BALLOON TO RISE OR FLOAT IN THE  ATMOS-
 PHERE. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO:
  (A)  BALLOONS  WHICH  ARE  USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING SCIENTIFIC
 INSTRUMENTATION DURING THE  PERFORMANCE  OF  AN  EXPERIMENT  OR  TESTING
 PROCEDURE  OR BY A PERSON ON BEHALF OF A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OR PURSUANT
 TO A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACT FOR SCIENTIFIC OR METEOROLOGICAL PURPOSES;
  (B) HOT AIR BALLOONS THAT ARE RECOVERED AFTER LAUNCHING;
  (C) BALLOONS RELEASED INDOORS.

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 LIKE SUBSTANCE; OR

 § 71-0929. ENFORCEMENT OF SECTION 11-0331 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  ANY VIOLATION OF SECTION 11-0331 OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL  BE  PUNISHABLE
 BY  A  CIVIL  PENALTY  OF FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH BALLOON RELEASED, NOT TO

 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.  Effective  immediate-
 ly,  the  addition,  amendment  and/or  repeal of any rule or regulation
