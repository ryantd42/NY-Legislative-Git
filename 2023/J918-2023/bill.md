  WHEREAS,  Day  of Independence Committee of Panamanians in New York,
Inc.  (DICPNY) was formed by Mauricio Alleyne in 1995 to  celebrate  and

and
 
  WHEREAS, This historic moment has been celebrated annually  for  the

  WHEREAS, The  mission  of  the  Day  of  Independence  Committee  of
Panamanians  in  New  York, Inc. is to stimulate the appreciation of the

community, along with the  promotion  of  area  base  programs  for  the
cultural growth and development of the youth in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  210,000  Panamanians  live in the United States, and about

well as Panamanian-Caribbean and Latin American food specialties; and

both here in the US and from Panama, as  well  as  other  nationalities,
elected  officials, community leaders, and other dignitaries locally and
across the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  members  of  DICPNY  continue  to  work
tirelessly  to promote, enhance, and expand the parade not only to bring
