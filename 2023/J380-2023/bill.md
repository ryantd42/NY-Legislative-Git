  CONGRATULATING  Lieutenant Mark Gualtieri upon the
  occasion  of  his  retirement  after  27  years  of
  dedicated service with the Rome Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend Lieutenant
Mark  Gualtieri  upon  the  occasion of his retirement after 27 years of
dedicated service with the Rome Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many firefighters have lost their lives to save  the  lives
of  others;  each and every day, they face danger and peril without fear
and perform their job with the utmost concern and professionalism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mark Gualtieri thoroughly enjoyed his job; this  courageous
man  was  promoted  to  Lieutenant  on  February  10, 2009, the esteemed
position from which he officially retired on Saturday, January 28, 2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, With him throughout have been his wife Joanne and his three
children, Dominick, Arielle and Elena, all of whom feel privileged to be
a part of his life and rejoice in his achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters such as Lieutenant Mark Gualtieri unwaveringly
serve  our  great  State  with  pride,  valor,  and  integrity;  this
extraordinary man's leadership and willingness to step up throughout his
career has truly set an example to be emulated by all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Lieutenant Mark Gualtieri is such a firefighter; throughout 27 years  of
devoted  service,  this  firefighter has heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Lieutenant  Mark  Gualtieri  upon  the  occasion  of  his
retirement after more than 27 years of distinguished service to the Rome
Fire Department, and to wish him well in all his future  endeavors;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Lieutenant Mark Gualtieri.
