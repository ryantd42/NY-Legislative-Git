 Introduced  by M. of A. AUBRY -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to  adjournments
  in contemplation of dismissal in cases involving marihuana
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 2 of section 170.56 of the  criminal  procedure
 law, as added by chapter 1042 of the laws of 1971, is amended to read as
 follows:
  2.  Upon ordering the action adjourned in contemplation of dismissal,
 the court MUST RELEASE THE DEFENDANT ON HIS OR HER OWN RECOGNIZANCE  AND
 must  set  and  specify  such  conditions  for the adjournment as may be
 appropriate[, and such]. SUCH conditions may include placing the defend-
 ant under the supervision of any public or private agency.  At any  time
 prior  to  dismissal  the  court  may modify the conditions or extend or
 reduce the term of the adjournment, except  that  the  total  period  of
 adjournment  shall  not  exceed  twelve  months.  Upon violation of any
 condition fixed by the court, the court may revoke its order and restore
 the case to the calendar and the prosecution thereupon must proceed.  If
 the case is not so restored to the calendar during the period  fixed  by
 the court, the accusatory instrument is, at the expiration of such peri-
 od, deemed to have been dismissed in the furtherance of justice.
  §  2.  This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law  and  shall  apply  to  all
 adjournments  in  contemplation  of  dismissal ordered on and after such
 date.
