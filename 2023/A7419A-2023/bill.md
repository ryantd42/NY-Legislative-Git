 AN ACT granting retroactive tier IV membership in the New York state and

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Raymond Ruckel, a tier VI member of the New York state and local employ-
 ees'  retirement system employed by the Rockland county sheriff's office
 correction division and who was employed as a  full-time  employee  with
 Clarkstown  Central School District from August 1, 1990 through December
 1, 1990 and who, through no fault of his own, did not become a member of
 the New York state and local employees' retirement system on  August  1,
 1990  when  he  became  eligible for membership in such system, shall be
 deemed to have a date of membership with the New York  state  and  local
 employees'  retirement  system  of  August  1,  1990 if he shall file an
 application therefore with the state comptroller within one year of  the
 effective  date  of  this  act.  Upon  the  receipt of such application,
 Raymond Ruckel shall be granted tier IV status in the New York state and
 local employees' retirement system and shall be  eligible  for  all  the
 rights and benefits thereof.
  § 2. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by Clarkstown Central School District, and there shall be
 no refund of member contributions to Raymond Ruckel.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant Tier 4 status in the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System to Raymond Ruckel, a current Tier 6  member
 employed  by  Rockland  County,  by changing their date of membership to
 August 1, 1990. There will be no refund of member contributions.

  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase  of  approximately  $5,900  in  the
 annual contributions of Rockland County for the fiscal year ending March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of Raymond Ruckel change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $40,300 which will be
 borne by the Clarkstown Central School District as a  one-time  payment.
 This estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
