  Section  1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 1 of article

  Exemptions  from  taxation  may  be  granted  only  by  general  laws.
 Exemptions  may  be  altered  or repealed except those exempting real or

 table purposes as defined by law and owned by any corporation or associ-
 ation  organized  or  conducted  exclusively  for  one  or  more of such
 purposes  and  not  operating  for  profit;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT
 EXEMPTIONS  OF  REAL  OR  PERSONAL PROPERTY USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR PRIVATE
 INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION MAY BE ALTERED OR REPEALED.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing  be  referred
 to  the  first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after the next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
