  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor

  WHEREAS,  The  36th  Annual  New  York  Wine Classic is a nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years  and
allowing  wine  enthusiasts  to  enjoy  this unique part of the New York
experience across the  state,  this  extraordinary  vineyard  has  truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Clovis  Point  Vineyard was awarded for its 2016 Sparkling
Brut, Cabernet Franc; its 2019 Black Label,  Chardonnay;  and  its  2019
Petit Verdot; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2001, the partners of Clovis Point Vineyard purchased 10
acres  of  farm land with a beautiful barn in the heart of North Folk on
the Main Road in Jamesport, with a dream of creating a small  top-flight
vineyard, winery and wine room for lovers of good wine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  its  tasting room, a renovated potato barn, crowns
those 10 acres, now under vine; with top-notch vineyard  management  and
award-winning  winemaking,  Clovis  Point's  wines actively combine lots
whose different yet complimentary qualities make  wines  with  character
and balance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  true to its mission, Clovis Point Vineyard will
continue to make remarkably good and interesting  wines  from  the  best
fruit North Folk vineyards can provide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard has
demonstrated continuous service to the residents and  communities  which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Clovis  Point  Vineyard  is  in  direct
correlation to the efforts of its  dedicated  owners  and  staff,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  businesses  and the
communities they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community,  fully confident it will continue to enjoy the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
