  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February  12,  2023,  as  Operation  Homecoming
  Recognition Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to pay the highest
tribute to the members of the United States Armed Forces during times of
crisis who have so faithfully served their community  and  country  with
courage  and commitment contributing to the safety and welfare of others
and the preservation of the  freedoms  and  democratic  principles  upon
which this State and Nation are founded; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  dedication  and  sacrifices of our military personnel
ensure our continued role as a  Nation  which  embodies  the  ideals  of
democracy, and which is a defender of liberty for peoples throughout the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  February  12,  2023,  as  Operation
Homecoming Recognition Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Operation  Homecoming  was  the  return  of  591  American
prisoners of war (POWs) held by North Vietnam following the Paris  Peace
Accords that officially ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  January  27,  1973, Henry Kissinger, then assistant to
President Richard Nixon for  national  security  affairs,  agreed  to  a
ceasefire  with  representatives of North Vietnam which provided for the
withdrawal of American military forces from South Vietnam; and
 
  WHEREAS, The agreement also postulated for the release of nearly 600
American prisoners of war held by North Vietnam and its allies within 60
days of the withdrawal of U.S. troops; the deal would come to  be  known
as Operation Homecoming and was divided into three phases; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first phase required the initial reception of prisoners
at three release sites: POWs held by the Viet Cong (VC) were to be flown
by  helicopter  to  Saigon,  POWs  held  by the People's Army of Vietnam
(PAVN) were released in Hanoi and the three POWs held in China  were  to
be freed in Hong Kong; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  former  prisoners  were to then be flown to Clark Air
Base in the Philippines where they were to be processed at  a  reception
center,  debriefed,  and receive a physical examination; the final phase
was the relocation of the POWs to military hospitals; and
 
  WHEREAS, On February 12, 1973, three C-141 transports flew to Hanoi,
North Vietnam, and one C-9A aircraft was sent to Saigon,  South  Vietnam
to  pick  up  released  prisoners  of  war;  the first flight of 40 U.S.
prisoners of war left Hanoi in a C-141A, which later became known as the
"Hanoi Taxi"; and
 
  WHEREAS, From February 12th until April 4, 1973, 54  C-141  missions
flew out of Hanoi, bringing the former POWs home; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Of  the  POWs repatriated to the United States, a total of
325 served in the United States Air Force,  a  majority  of  which  were
bomber  pilots  shot down over North Vietnam or VC controlled territory;
the remaining 266 consisted of 138 United  States  Naval  personnel,  77
soldiers  serving  in  the United States Army, 26 United States Marines,
and 25 civilian employees of American government agencies; and
 
  WHEREAS, American former Prisoners of War are heroes  whose  service
to our country will never be forgotten; these brave men and women fought
for  their  country and endured cruelties and deprivation as they helped
to protect our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The freedoms and security we cherish as Americans come at a
very high price for those serving in the military in times of  conflict;
it  is fitting and proper that we who are the beneficiaries of those who
risk  their  lives,  leaving  their  families  behind,  express  our
appreciation  and  eternal gratitude for their sacrifices and courageous
acts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 12, 2023, as
Operation Homecoming Recognition Day in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
