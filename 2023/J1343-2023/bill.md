Division  III  national championship game) and beat Dayton 34-20; Billie

part of his life and rejoice in his achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Billie  Mays  Jr.  has  clearly made a contribution to the
spirit of excellence which is a tradition of his Rome community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of such outstanding athletic accomplishments are brought to
 
our attention, they should be recognized by all  the  citizens  of  this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
