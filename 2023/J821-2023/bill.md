  COMMEMORATING the 24th Annual World Falun Dafa Day
  Celebration, to be observed May 13, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
24th Annual World Falun Dafa Day Celebration, to  be  observed  May  13,
2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  of  those  who  participate  in World Falun Dafa Day
celebrate the teachings which have brought  physical  health,  joy,  and
peace  of  mind  to  millions  of people across the globe throughout the
entire week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong, is a self-improvement
practice rooted in ancient Chinese culture based on  refining  the  body
and mind through special exercises and meditation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  special  event observes the day Falun Dafa was first
introduced to the general public in May of 1992, in Changchun, China, by
Mr. Li Hongzhi; he then traveled around China lecturing to  the  public;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The impact his lectures had on the society was so profound,
that  the  practice spread very rapidly by word of mouth alone; by 1998,
it was estimated that 100 million people had taken up  the  practice  in
China; and
 
  WHEREAS, The practice of Falun Dafa is simple; it consists primarily
of  two  components,  self-improvement through study and the practice of
five gentle exercises; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Practitioners  of  Falun  Dafa  strive  to  live  by  the
principles  of  Truthfulness,  Compassion  and  Forbearance  in order to
improve their moral nature, and in turn, to experience remarkable health
benefits; and
 
  WHEREAS, The practice of Falun  Dafa  goes  beyond  the  pursuit  of
health and fitness to the goal of greater wisdom and enlightenment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Falun Dafa philosophy espouses the idea that when the
heart is pure, the mind balanced, and the  body  energized,  health  and
happiness  are  a  natural  outcome;  individuals have been empowered to
leave behind addictions and bad  habits;  families,  to  live  in  peace
together;  and  communities,  to  embrace  what  is  virtuous  and
life-affirming; and
 
  WHEREAS, The effectiveness of Falun Dafa  in  improving  health,  as
well  as  the  principles  upon  which  it is founded, have proven to be
immensely popular throughout the world and have attracted people in more
than 114 countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, To the people of China, Falun Dafa  provides  a  source  of
strength  in  the face of oppression; although the practice is banned in
 
the land of its origin, practitioners persevere in the pursuit of  their
spiritual beliefs, risking imprisonment or worse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1996,  Falun  Dafa was introduced to New York, and has
since grown to include  hundreds  of  practitioners  who  can  be  found
throughout  the  tri-state  area  offering  workshops in senior centers,
corporate offices, health clubs, private residences and police  stations
at no cost to the participants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Falun Dafa is practiced and cherished by millions of
people and has received over 3,000 awards; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Falun  Dafa  is a practice which has brought better health
and inner peace to millions around the world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  24th  Annual  World  Falun Dafa Day Celebration, to be
observed May 13, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Falun Dafa practitioners of New York State.
