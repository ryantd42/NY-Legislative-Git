  of celebrating its 70th Anniversary on  October  21,
  2022
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those fraternal organizations of high purpose and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Rome  Lions Club upon the occasion of celebrating its 70th
Anniversary, to be celebrated on Friday, January 6, 2023, at the  Mohawk
Valley Community College's Rome Campus; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Rome Lions Club was chartered on October 21, 1952, by a
group of Rome citizens who believed in the principles of Lionism and the
benefits to the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The 14 original charter members include: Leland W. Castle,
Dr.  G. Frederick Caswell, Richard Flemma, Peter  M.  Grande,  Frank  J.
Guiltinan,  Bernard  E.  Ingersoll,  Haver F. Karlen, Francis R. Loreto,
Frank Loreto, Nicholas Mammone, Robert Morris, Joseph  Palombi,  Stanley
Rebisz, and Carl J. Swanson; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  event  will  honor the Past District Governor, Joseph
DeFina, who passed away in 2021, and was a longtime member of  the  Rome
Lions Club; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Rome Lions Club is part of Lions Clubs International,
one of the largest service organizations in the  world,  and  is  deeply
committed  to meeting the challenges of public service; currently, there
are approximately 46,000 clubs in more than 200 countries and geographic
areas around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lions are also recognized worldwide for  their  service  to
the  blind  and  visually impaired; this service began when Helen Keller
challenged the Lions to become her "knights of the blind in the  crusade
against darkness" during the Lions' 1925 International Convention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Rome Lions Club has performed 8,313 vision screenings
on the children of Rome resulting in being able to identify  several  of
them  with  issues  that  require  the earliest possible intervention to
prevent permanent blindness; and
 
  WHEREAS, In great service to their community, the  Rome  Lions  Club
has  established service projects now being modeled by other Lions Clubs
in District 20Y for their efforts to support literacy in children; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Rome Lions Club established the most vibrant Lions Club
in  District  20Y,  helping  to  provide  opportunities  for  leadership
development,  community  outreach,  and overall personal development for
their community's children; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Rome Lions Club is in direct correlation
to  the  efforts  of  its  members, whose involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Rome  Lions Club upon the occasion of celebrating its 70th
Anniversary, and to honor  its  members,  past  and  present,  who  have
labored  so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of life in
the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Rome Lions Club.
