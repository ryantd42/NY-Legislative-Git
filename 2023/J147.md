Senate Resolution No. 147
 
BY: Senator PARKER
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  153rd  Anniversary of the 15th
  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
significant  events which represent turning points in our unique history
and which are indelibly etched in the saga of our great Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 153rd Anniversary of the  15th  Amendment  to  the  U.S.
Constitution; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  15th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  granted
African-American men the right to vote by declaring that the  "right  of
citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude."; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  ratified on February 3, 1870, the promise of the
15th Amendment would not be fully realized for almost a century; through
the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other means,  Southern  states
were able to effectively disenfranchise African-Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It would take the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965
before the majority of African-Americans in the South were registered to
vote; the first vote drawn was by A.R. Waud; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
events  of  significance  in  the  history and progress of society; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  153rd  Anniversary  of  the 15th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
