  (F-1) THE COMMISSIONER OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL  SHALL  STAND-

  421-A STANDARD RIDER FACT SHEET
  ANY  DWELLING  UNIT WITHIN AN ELIGIBLE SITE THAT RECEIVES TAX BENEFITS
 UNDER SECTION 421-A OF THE NEW YORK STATE REAL  PROPERTY  TAX  LAW  WILL
 REMAIN  RENT  STABILIZED  FOR A PERIOD OF TIME DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF
 FACTORS, INCLUDING  THE  LOCATION  OF  THE  UNIT,  THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF
 CONSTRUCTION  AND  THE  AFFORDABILITY IN THE PROJECT. FAILURE TO PROVIDE
 THE INITIAL STANDARDIZED RIDER MAY RESULT IN  THE  UNIT  REMAINING  RENT
 STABILIZED FOR THE DURATION OF THE TENANCY.  SPECIFIC DETAILS RELATED TO
 YOUR  UNIT ARE LISTED ON THE NEXT SHEET.  WHILE YOUR UNIT RECEIVES 421-A
 TAX BENEFITS, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO RENT STABILIZATION. NEW YORK STATE'S
 RENT REGULATION LAWS PROVIDE TENANTS IN RENT-STABILIZED APARTMENTS  WITH
 A  VARIETY  OF LEGAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS.  THE OWNER OF YOUR BUILDING
 MUST PROVIDE YOU WITH A RENT-STABILIZED LEASE WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE IN AND
 ALSO EACH TIME YOU RENEW YOUR LEASE FOR YOUR CHOICE OF EITHER A  ONE  OR
 TWO YEAR TERM, FOR AS LONG AS YOUR APARTMENT REMAINS STABILIZED.
  YOU  ARE ENTITLED TO CONTINUOUS LEASE RENEWALS WHILE YOUR APARTMENT IS
 RENT STABILIZED. WHEN YOU RENEW  YOUR  LEASE,  YOUR  RENT  MAY  ONLY  BE
 INCREASED  BY  AN  AMOUNT DETERMINED BY NEW YORK STATE'S RENT REGULATION
 LAWS, WHICH MAY BE FOUND BY VISITING (ENTER WEB ADDRESS), AND  PERMITTED
 BY APPLICABLE TAX BENEFIT LAWS.
  RENT  INCREASES  FOR RENT-STABILIZED TENANTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE NEW
 YORK CITY RENT GUIDELINES BOARD, AND GENERALLY, MAY ONLY INCREASE  BY  A
 SPECIFIED  AMOUNT  WITHIN  A  ONE-YEAR  OR TWO-YEAR LEASE TERM. FOR MORE
 INFORMATION, PLEASE VISIT (ENTER WEB ADDRESS) OR  CALL  (ENTER  NUMBER).
 RENT-STABILIZED  TENANTS ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO ASSISTANCE BY THE NEW YORK
 STATE HOMES AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL BY VISITING  (ENTER  WEB  ADDRESS)  OR
 CALLING (ENTER NUMBER).

 (ENTER  NUMBER)  OR  VISITING  (ENTER  WEB ADDRESS) OR THE NEW YORK CITY
