 A. 6636--A  3
 
  § 6.  This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to  Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide an increase in the defined benefit cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with the payment in September 2024, the base benefit for computation
 of the annual COLA, currently $18,000, will be increased annually by 50%
 of the annual inflation rate not to exceed 3% or be less than 1%.
  The provisions of Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
 shall not apply.
  This proposal primarily benefits current and former members of Tiers 1
 -  5.  The  cost  of this benefit improvement will disproportionately be
 borne by current and future members of Tier 6.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the  NYSLERS.
 If  this  bill  were  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 increase in the present value of benefits would be  approximately  $1.30
 billion.
 
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $1.03 billion  $634 million
  Tier 6  $0.27 billion  $663 million
  Total  $1.30 billion  $1.30 billion
 
  In  the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in  NYSLERS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately $51 million to the State of New York and approximately $76
 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 will  vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate
 and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $189 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $150 million  $80 million
  Tier 6  $39 million  $109 million
  Total  $189 million  $189 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $3.4  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $14 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
  We anticipate some administrative costs to implement the provisions of
 this legislation.
