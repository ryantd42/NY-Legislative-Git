 RELEVANT, ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE ON THEIR OWN BEHALF.
  (II) AT THE REQUEST OF THE PARTICIPANT OR THE  PARTICIPANT'S  COUNSEL,
 THE  COURT  MAY  CONDUCT  PROCEEDINGS OFF THE RECORD FOR PORTIONS OF THE
 PROCEEDINGS THAT WILL LIKELY RESULT IN ADVERSE COLLATERAL  CONSEQUENCES,
 INCLUDING  IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE COURT SHALL

  (c) If the court determines BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE that  the
 [defendant]  PARTICIPANT has violated a PROGRAM condition [of his or her
 S. 1976--B  9

 release under the judicial  diversion  program,  the]  IN  AN  IMPORTANT
 RESPECT  OR WILLFULLY FAILED TO APPEAR, THE COURT SHALL RESPOND BY USING
 A SYSTEM OF GRADUATED AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SUCH
 INAPPROPRIATE  BEHAVIORS  AND  FACILITATE,  WHERE  POSSIBLE, SUCCESSFUL
 COMPLETION OF THE TREATMENT PROGRAM. THE court may  PERMIT  THE  PARTIC-
 IPANT  TO CONTINUE THEIR TREATMENT MANDATE AS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED; modify
 the [conditions thereof, reconsider the order of  recognizance  or  bail
 pursuant  to  subdivision two of section 510.30 of this chapter,] TREAT-
 MENT PLAN ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TREATMENT PROVIDER;  or
 terminate  the [defendant's] PARTICIPANT'S participation in the judicial
 diversion program[; and when applicable  proceed  with  the  defendant's
 sentencing  in  accordance  with  the  agreement.  Notwithstanding  any
 provision of law to the contrary, the  court  may  impose  any  sentence
 authorized  for  the  crime  of  conviction  in accordance with the plea
 agreement, or any lesser sentence authorized to be imposed on  a  felony
 drug  offender  pursuant  to  paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision two of
 section 70.70 of the penal law taking into account] IF NO  OTHER  TREAT-
 MENT OPTION IS AVAILABLE. IF THE COURT FINDS A REASONABLE EXPLANATION OR
 MITIGATION  FOR  ANY  ALLEGED  VIOLATION  OR  ALLEGED WILLFUL FAILURE TO
 APPEAR, THE SECURING ORDER  SHALL  NOT  BE  MODIFIED.  THE  COURT  SHALL
 CONSIDER:
  (I) the length of time the [defendant] PARTICIPANT HAS spent in [resi-
 dential] treatment and how best to continue treatment [while the defend-
 ant  is  serving that sentence. In determining what action to take for a
 violation of a release condition, the court shall consider];
  (II) all relevant circumstances, including the views of  the  prosecu-
 tor, the defense and the [alcohol or substance use] PARTICIPANT'S INTER-
 EST  IN  CONTINUING treatment [provider, and the extent to which persons
 who ultimately successfully complete a drug treatment regimen sometimes]
 OR THE PROGRAM;
  (III) THE ROLE OF relapse [by not abstaining from alcohol or substance
 use or by failing to comply fully with all  requirements  imposed  by  a
 treatment  program.  The  court  shall also consider using a system of
 graduated and appropriate responses or  sanctions  designed  to  address
 such  inappropriate  behaviors,  protect  public  safety and facilitate,
 where possible, successful completion of the alcohol  or  substance  use
 treatment program] IN RECOVERY AND TREATMENT; AND
  (IV)  ANY  OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED THE ALLEGED
 VIOLATION OR WILLFUL FAILURE TO APPEAR.
  (d) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed  [as  preventing  a
 court  from  terminating  a  defendant's  participation  in the judicial
 diversion program for violating a release condition when such  a  termi-
 nation  is  necessary  to  preserve public safety. Nor shall anything in
 this subdivision be  construed]  as  precluding  the  prosecution  of  a
 [defendant]  PARTICIPANT for the commission of a different offense while
 participating in the judicial diversion program.
  (e) A [defendant] PARTICIPANT may at any time advise  the  court  that
 [he  or she wishes] THEY WISH to terminate participation in the judicial
 diversion program, at which time the court shall [proceed with the  case
 and, where applicable, shall impose sentence in accordance with the plea
 agreement.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of law to the contrary, the
 court may impose any sentence authorized for the crime of conviction  in
 accordance with the plea agreement, or any lesser sentence authorized to
 be imposed on a felony drug offender pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of
 subdivision  two  of  section 70.70 of the penal law taking into account
 the length of time the defendant spent in residential treatment and  how

 TRANSFER THE CASE BACK TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIAL PART.
  10.  Upon  the  court's determination that the [defendant] PARTICIPANT
 has successfully completed the required period of [alcohol or  substance
 use]  treatment  and has otherwise satisfied the conditions required for
 successful completion of the judicial diversion program, the court shall
 [comply with the terms and conditions it set for final disposition  when
 it  accepted  the  defendant's  agreement to participate in the judicial
 diversion program. Such disposition may include, but is not limited  to:
 (a)  requiring  the  defendant  to undergo a period of interim probation
 supervision and, upon  the  defendant's  successful  completion  of  the
 interim probation supervision term, notwithstanding the provision of any
 other  law,  permitting the defendant to withdraw his or her guilty plea
 and dismissing the indictment; or (b) requiring the defendant to undergo
 a  period  of  interim  probation  supervision  and,  upon  successful
 completion  of  the  interim probation supervision term, notwithstanding
 the provision of any other law, permitting the defendant to withdraw his
 or her guilty plea, enter a guilty plea to  a  misdemeanor  offense  and
 sentencing  the  defendant  as promised in the plea agreement, which may
 include a period of probation supervision pursuant to section  65.00  of
 the  penal  law;  or  (c)  allowing the defendant to withdraw his or her
 guilty plea and dismissing] DISMISS the  indictment  OR  SUPERIOR  COURT

 FULLY COMPLETE JUDICIAL DIVERSION SHALL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE  TO  APPLY  FOR
 SEALING OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 160.58 OF THIS CHAPTER.
 UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF JUDICIAL DIVERSION, THE COURT SHALL NOTIFY
 THE  PARTICIPANT  OF THEIR POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR SEALING PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 160.58 OF THIS CHAPTER. NO PARTICIPANT  SHALL
 BE REQUIRED OR PERMITTED TO WAIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR SEALING AS A CONDITION
 OF PARTICIPATION IN JUDICIAL DIVERSION.
  10-A. TREATMENT PROVIDERS SHALL COLLABORATE WITH  THE  PARTICIPANT AND
 THE  COURT TO CREATE A POST-GRADUATION PLAN PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF JUDI-
 CIAL  DIVERSION. SUCH PLAN SHALL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ASSIST THE PARTIC-
 IPANT IN OBTAINING STABLE  HOUSING  AND  MEETING  THEIR  SELF-IDENTIFIED
 LONG-TERM  GOALS  AFTER GRADUATION. HOWEVER, WHEN A PARTICIPANT FINISHES
 THEIR TREATMENT PLAN, THEY  SHALL BE CONSIDERED  TO  HAVE  SUCCESSFULLY
 COMPLETED  THEIR OBLIGATION TO THE COURT, REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO
 SECURE HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, OR OTHER PERSONAL GOALS IDENTIFIED.
  11. Nothing in this article  shall  be  construed  as  restricting  or
 prohibiting  courts or district attorneys from using other lawful proce-
 dures or  models  for  placing  appropriate  persons  into  [alcohol  or
 substance use] treatment.
