 AN ACT to amend the cannabis law, in relation to authorizing conditional
  adult-use cultivator and processor licensees to sell tested, packaged,
  and sealed cannabis products and cannabis  to  a  cannabis  dispensing
  facility licensed by a tribal nation for retail sale
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "cannabis
 crop rescue act".
  §  2. Legislative findings. Chapter 18 of the laws of 2022 created the
 conditional adult-use cultivator license. Due to a  variety  of  circum-
 stances  beyond  the control of New York's cannabis farmers, many licen-
 sees cannot afford to process their  cannabis  or  sell  their  finished
 products.  As a result, their 2022 crops are losing value while in stor-
 age due to diminished potency, color and aroma.  Without sales, many are
 unable to plant a crop for the  upcoming  growing  season,  and  are  in
 severe financial stress.
  §  3.  Section  68-c  of the cannabis law is amended by adding two new
 subdivisions 16 and 17 to read as follows:
  16.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF  THIS  CHAPTER,  A  CONDI-
 TIONAL ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR OR PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO
 SELL  TESTED,  PACKAGED,  AND  SEALED  CANNABIS PRODUCTS OR BIOMASS TO A
 CANNABIS DISPENSING FACILITY LICENSED OR PERMITTED BY  A  TRIBAL  NATION
 FOR  RETAIL SALE.  TRIBAL NATIONS SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO OR LIMITED BY
 AGGREGATE SALES OR CONSUMPTION LIMITS OTHERWISE  PROVIDED  FOR  IN  THIS
 CHAPTER.  NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO ALTER, MODI-
 FY, ABROGATE, OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE OR INTERFERE WITH SUCH TRIBAL NATION'S
 SOVEREIGN  AUTHORITY  TO LICENSE, SELL, CULTIVATE, PROCESS, MANUFACTURE,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 7375--A  2
 
 DISTRIBUTE, DELIVER, OR TRANSPORT  CANNABIS  PRODUCT  ON  OR  AMONG  ITS
 TERRITORIES.  ANY  PRODUCT SOLD BY A CONDITIONAL ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR OR
 PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF  ARTICLE  TWEN-
 TY-C OF THE TAX LAW; AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT THE LICENSEE SHALL BEAR
 THE  COST OF ALL SUCH TAXES IMPOSED BY SUCH ARTICLE AND SHALL REMIT SUCH
 TAXES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE.
  17. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER, A CONDITIONAL
 ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR OR PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL BE AUTHORIZED  TO  SELL
 TESTED,  PACKAGED  AND  SEALED  CANNABIS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS;
 PROVIDED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION CONSUMER  SHALL  MEAN  AN
 AUTHORIZED  REPRESENTATIVE  OF  A  TRIBAL  NATION.  CONSUMERS UNDER THIS
 SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO OR LIMITED  BY  AGGREGATE  SALES  OR
 CONSUMPTION  LIMITS  OTHERWISE  PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CHAPTER. NOTHING IN
 THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO ALTER, MODIFY, ABROGATE OR OTHER-
 WISE IMPEDE OR INTERFERE WITH SUCH TRIBAL NATION'S  SOVEREIGN  AUTHORITY
 TO  LICENSE,  SELL, CULTIVATE, PROCESS, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, DELIVER
 OR TRANSPORT CANNABIS PRODUCT ON OR AMONG ITS TERRITORIES.  ANY  PRODUCT
 SOLD  BY  A CONDITIONAL ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR OR PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL
 BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY-C OF  THE  TAX  LAW;  AND
 PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  THAT  THE  LICENSEE SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ALL SUCH
 TAXES IMPOSED BY SUCH ARTICLE AND SHALL REMIT SUCH TAXES TO THE  DEPART-
 MENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE.
  § 4. A conditional adult-use cultivator licensee may select to operate
 under  subdivision 16 of section 68-c of the cannabis law until December
 31, 2023.
  § 5.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however,  that
 the amendments to section 68-c of the cannabis law made by section three
 of  this  act  shall  not affect the repeal of such section and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
