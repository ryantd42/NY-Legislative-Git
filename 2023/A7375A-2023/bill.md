 Introduced by M. of A. LUPARDO, PEOPLES-STOKES, BRONSON -- read once and
  referred to the Committee on Economic Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the cannabis law, in relation to authorizing conditional
  adult-use cultivator and processor licensees to sell tested, packaged,
  and  sealed  cannabis  products  and cannabis to a cannabis dispensing
  facility licensed by a tribal nation for retail sale
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "cannabis
 crop rescue act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. Chapter 18 of the laws of 2022 created  the
 conditional  adult-use  cultivator  license. Due to a variety of circum-
 stances beyond the control of New York's cannabis farmers,  many  licen-
 sees  cannot  afford  to  process  their cannabis or sell their finished
 products. As a result, their 2022 crops are losing value while in  stor-
 age due to diminished potency, color and aroma.  Without sales, many are
 unable  to  plant  a  crop  for  the upcoming growing season, and are in
 severe financial stress.
  § 3. Section 68-c of the cannabis law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 16 to read as follows:
  16.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER, A CONDI-
 TIONAL ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR OR PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO
 SELL TESTED, PACKAGED, AND SEALED CANNABIS PRODUCTS  OR  CANNABIS  GROWN
 DURING  THE  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-TWO  GROWING  SEASON,  TO  A CANNABIS
 DISPENSING FACILITY LICENSED BY A TRIBAL NATION FOR RETAIL SALE. NOTHING
 IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO ALTER,  MODIFY,  ABROGATE,  OR
 OTHERWISE  IMPEDE  OR  INTERFERE  WITH  SUCH  TRIBAL  NATION'S SOVEREIGN
 AUTHORITY TO LICENSE, SELL, CULTIVATE, PROCESS, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE,
 DELIVER, OR TRANSPORT CANNABIS PRODUCT ON OR AMONG ITS TERRITORIES.  ANY
 PRODUCT SOLD BY A CONDITIONAL-USE CULTIVATOR OR PROCESSOR LICENSEE SHALL
 BE  SUBJECT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY-C OF THE TAX LAW; AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT THE LICENSEE SHALL BEAR THE  COST  OF  ALL  SUCH
 TAXES  IMPOSED BY SUCH ARTICLE AND SHALL REMIT SUCH TAXES TO THE DEPART-
 MENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE.  THE OFFICE IS AUTHORIZED TO  ISSUE  EMER-
 GENCY REGULATIONS, IF NECESSARY, TO IMPLEMENT THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 4. A conditional adult-use cultivator licensee may select to operate
 under  subdivision 16 of section 68-c of the cannabis law until December
 31, 2023.
  § 5.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however,  that
 the amendments to section 68-c of the cannabis law made by section three
 of  this  act  shall  not affect the repeal of such section and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
