  COMMEMORATING  the 100th Anniversary of the Galway
  Volunteer Fire Company to be celebrated on Saturday,
  August 26, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proud  to  commemorate  the  100th
Anniversary  of  the Galway Volunteer Fire Company and to honor its past
and present members for 100  years  of  fire  protection  and  emergency
response to most of the Town of Galway, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fire companies are an integral part of community protection
services  in every locality of our State; during the past 100 years, the
courageous and devoted firefighters of  Galway  Volunteer  Fire  Company
have  valiantly  responded  to all types of emergencies and have won the
praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer firefighters serve without pay,  devote  hundreds
of  hours  of  time away from family, and in many cases; spend their own
money on firefighting gear and bear the responsibility  for  recruitment
and retention to maintain organizational stability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  current  leadership  of Company President Bill
Schwab, and Chief Russell DeRidder, the Galway  Volunteer  Fire  Company
has  held up the high standards of ensuring public safety which has been
a staple of this company since its inception; and
 
  WHEREAS, Always at the ready,  the  Galway  Volunteer  Fire  Company
handles  an  average  of  285-300 calls annually, responding when called
upon in a professional and timely manner; and
 
  WHEREAS, The record of the Galway Volunteer Fire Company  in  public
service and fire protection is one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for
365  days a year, for 100 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these noble
volunteers left their homes and went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, The brave firefighters of Galway Volunteer Fire  Department
are  prepared  to  risk  their lives every day to help save the lives of
others and to protect homes and property from the destruction caused  by
fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by individual firefighters and emergency personnel, the Galway Volunteer
Fire  Company  reflects  on  their  rich  history  and  development  of
firefighting  over  the  past  100  years  at a celebration on Saturday,
August 26, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving, especially in a volunteer capacity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
 
good works performed by the  volunteer  fire  companies  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Galway  Volunteer  Fire
Company; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ranking members of the Galway Volunteer Fire Company.
