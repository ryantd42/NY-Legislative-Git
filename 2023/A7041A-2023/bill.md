 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Saddle Rock Minyan to file an applica-
  tion for retroactive real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Saddle Rock Minyan an application for exemption from real property taxes
 pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax law with  respect  to
 the  2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls for a portion of the 2021-
 2022 school taxes, a portion of the  2021  general  taxes,  all  of  the
 2022-2023 school taxes, and all of the 2022 general taxes for the parcel
 owned by such organization, with such parcel being located at 115 Green-
 leaf  Hill,  in  the  incorporated village of Saddle Rock, town of North
 Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau  county  tax  map
 district  007,  section 02, block 318, lot 60. If accepted, the applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status dates established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the town board, may grant exemption
 from all taxation beginning on the date of the conveyance of such parcel
 to such organization, and make appropriate corrections  to  the  subject
 rolls.  If  such  exemption  is  granted and such organization therefore
 shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the governing
 body or tax department may, in its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the
 refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and  cancel any taxes, fines, penalties,
 interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
