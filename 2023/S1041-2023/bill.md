  § 1022-E. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER
 OF  EMINENT DOMAIN. 1. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY EXPRESSLY FINDS AND DETER-
 MINES:
  (A) THE ACQUISITION BY THE AUTHORITY, THROUGH PURCHASE OR THE EXERCISE
 OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, OF EITHER THE SECURITIES OR ASSETS OF  A
 DOWNSTATE  UTILITY CORPORATION WHICHEVER IS LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE RATE-
 PAYERS, AS THE AUTHORITY MAY DETERMINE WILL BE JUST TO THE RATEPAYERS IN
 THE SERVICE AREA, IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE  MEANS  OF  DEALING  WITH  THE
 EMERGENCY  INVOLVING THE ECONOMY, HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS AND
 THE INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE IN THE SERVICE AREA, NOTWITHSTANDING THE  FACT
 THAT  SUCH  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY CORPORATION PRESENTLY MAY BE DEVOTED TO A
 PUBLIC USE, SINCE THE PUBLIC USE OF SUCH PROPERTY BY  THE  AUTHORITY  IS
 HEREBY  DEEMED  TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE PUBLIC USE OF SUCH PROPERTY BY ANY
 OTHER PERSON, ASSOCIATION, OR CORPORATION.
  (B) THE AUTHORITY, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN  TO
 ACQUIRE  THE  STOCK  OR ASSETS OF A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION, SHALL
 ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION FOR  THE
 PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING SUCH STOCK OR ASSETS UPON SUCH TERMS AS THE AUTHOR-
 ITY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DETERMINES WILL RESULT IN RATES EQUAL TO OR
 LESS  THAN THE RATES WHICH WOULD RESULT IF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPO-
 RATION WERE TO CONTINUE IN OPERATION.
  (C) THE COMPENSATION PAID BY THE  AUTHORITY  TO  A  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY
 CORPORATION SHALL BE JUST TO THE RATEPAYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA WHO MUST
 PAY SUCH COMPENSATION.
  (D)  IF  THE  AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS THE STOCK OF A DOWNSTATE
 UTILITY CORPORATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN, THE PROPER MEASURE OF  DAMAGES
 SHALL BE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THEREOF AS EVIDENCED BY THE PRICE OF SUCH
 STOCK  ON THE EXCHANGE ON WHICH IT IS TRADED ON THE VALUATION DATE SINCE
 THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR SUCH STOCK THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF  ITS
 VALUE. IN NO EVENT, HOWEVER, SHALL CONSEQUENTIAL OR SEVERANCE DAMAGES BE
 AWARDED IF CONTROL OF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION SHALL HAVE BEEN
 TAKEN BY THE AUTHORITY.
  (E)  IF  THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS THE ASSETS OF A DOWNSTATE
 UTILITY CORPORATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN, FAIR MARKET  VALUE  WOULD  NOT
 CONSTITUTE JUST COMPENSATION TO SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION SINCE
 THERE  IS  AN  INSUFFICIENT  MARKET IN THE USUAL SENSE FOR ITS ASSETS TO
 ASCERTAIN THE VALUE THEREOF FROM THE MARKET. IN DETERMINING THE  COMPEN-
 S. 1041  8
 
 SATION  PAYABLE FOR SUCH ASSETS, THERE SHALL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
 THE CAPITALIZATION OF  SUCH  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY  CORPORATION'S  EXPECTED
 FUTURE EARNINGS.
  (F)  NEITHER  CONSEQUENTIAL  NOR  SEVERANCE  DAMAGES ARE PROPER IF THE
 AUTHORITY CONDEMNS ALL THE ASSETS OF A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION.
  (G) SUCH AN ACQUISITION BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECURITIES  OR  ASSETS
 OF  A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION SERVES THE PUBLIC PURPOSES OF ASSUR-
 ING THE PROVISION OF AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF  GAS  AND  ELECTRICITY  IN  A
 RELIABLE,  EFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC MANNER AND RETAINING EXISTING COMMERCE
 AND INDUSTRY IN AND ATTRACTING NEW COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY TO THE  SERVICE
 AREA, ALL OF WHICH ARE MATTERS OF STATE-WIDE CONCERN.
  2.  IN  FURTHERANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS SET
 FORTH IN SUBDIVISION ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  AUTHORITY  IS  HEREBY
 AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO ACQUIRE, THROUGH PURCHASE OR THE EXERCISE OF
 THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, ALL OR ANY PART OF THE SECURITIES OR ASSETS
 OF  A  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY  CORPORATION,  AS  THE  AUTHORITY  IN ITS SOLE
 DISCRETION MAY DETERMINE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT  PRIOR  TO  PROCEEDING
 WITH  ANY SUCH ACQUISITION UNDER THIS TITLE, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES SHALL
 DETERMINE, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION BASED UPON SUCH ENGINEERING, FINANCIAL
 AND LEGAL DATA, STUDIES AND OPINIONS AS IT MAY  DEEM  APPROPRIATE,  THAT
 THE  RATES  PROJECTED  TO BE CHARGED AFTER SUCH ACQUISITION AND FOR SUCH
 REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AS THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES  MAY  DETERMINE  WILL
 NOT  BE  HIGHER THAN THE RATES PROJECTED TO BE CHARGED BY SUCH DOWNSTATE
 UTILITY CORPORATION DURING SUCH  PERIOD  IF  SUCH  ACQUISITION  HAD  NOT
 OCCURRED.
  3.  THE AUTHORITY ALSO IS AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED, IN ITS DISCRETION,
 TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER OR TENDER OFFERS FOR ALL OR ANY  PORTION  OF  THE
 SECURITIES OF A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION AT SUCH PRICE OR PRICES AS
 THE  AUTHORITY  MAY  DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT
 SUCH TENDER OFFER OR TENDER OFFERS, IN THE SOLE JUDGMENT OF THE AUTHORI-
 TY, WILL RESULT IN RATES LESS THAN THE RATES  WHICH  WOULD  RESULT  FROM
 CONTINUED OPERATION BY SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION.
  (A)  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL MAKE SUCH OFFER OR OFFERS OR ANY ADJUSTMENT
 THEREOF PRIOR TO ACQUIRING ANY SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY ASSETS OF A  DOWN-
 STATE  UTILITY  CORPORATION THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT
 DOMAIN. THE AUTHORITY MAY PAY FOR SUCH SECURITIES IN CASH OR BY EXCHANG-
 ING THEREFOR THE AUTHORITY'S BONDS OR A COMBINATION THEREOF.
  (B) IN THE CASE OF A TENDER OFFER IN WHICH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE AUTHOR-
 ITY ACQUIRES AT LEAST SIXTY-SIX AND TWO-THIRDS PERCENT  OF  A  DOWNSTATE
 UTILITY  CORPORATION'S COMMON STOCK, SUCH SUBSIDIARY MAY MERGE WITH SUCH
 DOWNSTATE UTILITY  CORPORATION  AND  EITHER  CONTINUE  IN  EXISTENCE  OR
 DISSOLVE, AS IT MAY DETERMINE.
  (C)  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SECTION  FIVE  HUNDRED  THIRTEEN AND ARTICLE
 SIXTEEN OF THE BUSINESS CORPORATION LAW AND ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF  LAW
 RELATING  TO PROCEDURES IN A CORPORATE TAKEOVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMI-
 TATION CHAPTER NINE HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF  THE  LAWS  OF  NINETEEN  HUNDRED
 EIGHTY-FIVE,  SHALL  NOT  BE  APPLICABLE TO THE ACTIONS OF THE AUTHORITY

  4. THE AUTHORITY, SHOULD IT DETERMINE,  IN  ITS  SOLE  DISCRETION,  TO
 ACQUIRE  THE  STOCK  OR ASSETS OF A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION BY THE
 EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, SHALL NOT  TAKE  TITLE  TO  NOR
 POSSESSION OF SUCH STOCK OR ASSETS PRIOR TO A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE
 AMOUNT  OF COMPENSATION TO BE PAID FOR SUCH STOCK OR ASSETS NOR PRIOR TO
 A DETERMINATION BY THE AUTHORITY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THAT THE TAKING
 OF SUCH STOCK OR ASSETS WILL RESULT IN RATES LESS THAN THE  RATES  WHICH
 WOULD  RESULT  FROM CONTINUED OPERATION BY SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPO-
 RATION.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE EMINENT DOMAIN  PROCEDURE
 LAW,  THE  PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS FIVE AND SIX OF THIS SECTION SHALL
 APPLY TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE STOCK  OR  PROPERTY  OF  SUCH  DOWNSTATE
 UTILITY CORPORATION BY THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, PROVIDED HOWEVER, TO
 THE  EXTENT  THE PROVISIONS HEREIN DO NOT SUPERSEDE OR CONFLICT WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF SUCH LAW THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH LAW SHALL APPLY.
  5. PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK.
 (A) IN THE EVENT THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES TO  ACQUIRE  THE  STOCK  OF  A
 DOWNSTATE  UTILITY  CORPORATION  BY THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT
 DOMAIN, HAVING FIRST ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH DOWNSTATE UTIL-
 ITY CORPORATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF SUCH STOCK, THE AUTHORITY  NEED  NOT
 HOLD ANY PUBLIC HEARING ON ITS INTENTION TO CONDEMN SUCH STOCK OR ON THE
 QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC USE OF SUCH ACTION, SUCH FINDING HAVING BEEN MADE
 BY THE LEGISLATURE HEREIN. THE AUTHORITY SHALL COMMENCE SUCH ACQUISITION
 BY  SERVING  UPON SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION AND FILING WITH THE
 COUNTY CLERK OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF  SUCH  DOWN-
 STATE UTILITY CORPORATION IS LOCATED A NOTICE DESCRIBING THE STOCK BEING
 ACQUIRED,  THE  VALUATION DATE, AS DETERMINED BY THE AUTHORITY, AND SUCH
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS THE AUTHORITY MAY REASONABLY DEEM NECESSARY TO
 FACILITATE THE PROCESS OF CONDEMNATION AND  PAYMENT.  THE  NOTICE  SHALL
 STATE  THAT  IT IS A NOTICE OF PENDENCY OF AN ACQUISITION PROCEEDING AND
 THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL ELECT WHETHER OR NOT TO PAY THE AMOUNT  OF  SUCH
 AWARD  WHEN  IT  HAS  BEEN  FINALLY DETERMINED. THE AUTHORITY ALSO SHALL
 CAUSE A COPY OF SUCH NOTICE (I) TO BE SERVED  UPON  THE  STOCK  TRANSFER
 AGENT OR AGENTS DESIGNATED BY SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION FOR THE
 TRANSFER  AND  REGISTRATION  OF ITS STOCK AND (II) TO BE PUBLISHED IN AT
 LEAST FIVE SUCCESSIVE ISSUES OF A DAILY  NEWSPAPER  OF  NATIONAL  CIRCU-
 LATION.
  (B)  UPON  RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THE STOCK TRANSFER AGENT OR AGENTS,
 AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AUTHORITY, SHALL FORTHWITH SERVE UPON EACH OF  THE
 REGISTERED  OWNERS OF SUCH STOCK A COPY OF SUCH NOTICE. SERVICE SHALL BE
 DEEMED SUFFICIENT IF MAILED BY  CERTIFIED  OR  REGISTERED  MAIL  TO  THE
 ADDRESS OF EACH SUCH OWNER AS SHOWN ON A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION'S
 STOCK  TRANSFER  BOOKS.  SERVICE  OF  THE NOTICE UPON THE STOCK TRANSFER
 AGENT OR AGENTS AND ITS PUBLICATION SHALL NOT BE JURISDICTIONAL  PREREQ-
 UISITES  TO  THE  VALIDITY OF THE TAKING. FAILURE TO NOTIFY ANY OWNER OF
 STOCK TO BE TAKEN WILL NOT INVALIDATE ANY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT  HEREUNDER
 OR ANY TITLE ACQUIRED BY THE AUTHORITY.
  (C)  UPON  FILING  OF  THE  NOTICE  DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION, THE AUTHORITY SHALL PETITION A SPECIAL TERM OF THE  SUPREME
 COURT  IN  THE  JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPO-
 RATION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE  STOCK.  SUCH
 PETITION SHALL BE GENERALLY IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN
 PROCEDURE LAW SO FAR AS CONSISTENT HEREWITH.
  (D)  THE SUPREME COURT IN THE DISTRICT IN WHICH SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY
 CORPORATION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICE SHALL HAVE  EXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION
 TO  HEAR  AND DETERMINE ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF STOCK
 BY THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF  EMINENT  DOMAIN  AND  SHALL  HEAR  SUCH
 S. 1041  10
 
 CLAIMS  WITHOUT  A JURY AND WITHOUT REFERRAL TO A REFEREE OR COMMISSION-
 ERS.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION NINE HUNDRED ONE OF  THE
 CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, UPON MOTION TO THE COURT BY THE AUTHORITY,
 THE  CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF STOCK SHALL BE MAIN-
 TAINED AS A CLASS ACTION, PURSUANT TO REMAINING  PROVISIONS  OF  ARTICLE
 NINE  OF  THE  CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, AND THE OWNERS OF THE STOCK
 SHALL BE DEEMED A DEFENDANT CLASS ON THE BASIS OF THE FOLLOWING  EXPRESS
 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
  (I) THE CLASS OF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK OWNERS IS SO
 NUMEROUS THAT JOINDER OF ALL MEMBERS IS IMPRACTICABLE;
  (II)  THE  ISSUE  OF  VALUATION  OF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION
 STOCK IS COMMON TO ALL SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION  STOCK  OWNERS
 AND  THERE  ARE  QUESTIONS  OF LAW OR FACT COMMON TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH
 CLASS WHICH PREDOMINATE OVER ANY  QUESTIONS  AFFECTING  ONLY  INDIVIDUAL
 MEMBERS;
  (III)  THE  CLAIMS OR DEFENSES, IF ANY, OF ANY REPRESENTATIVE OWNER OF
 SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK TO ACQUISITION THEREOF  BY  THE
 AUTHORITY ARE TYPICAL OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES OF THE CLASS;
  (IV)  THERE  ARE REPRESENTATIVE PARTIES WHO WILL FAIRLY AND ADEQUATELY
 PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE CLASS; AND
  (V) THE PROSECUTION OF  SEPARATE  ACTIONS  BY  OR  AGAINST  INDIVIDUAL
 MEMBERS  OF  THE  CLASS  WOULD  CREATE A RISK OF INCONSISTENT OR VARYING
 ADJUDICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF VALUATION  AND  OTHER  ISSUES
 COMMON TO THE CLASS.
  (E)  THE  PROCEDURE  FOR DETERMINING JUST COMPENSATION SHALL BE IN THE
 MANNER PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE  LAW,  EXCEPT  TO  THE
 EXTENT SUCH PROCEDURE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE,
 IN WHICH CASE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE SHALL CONTROL.
  (F)  UPON  THE ENTRY OF AN AWARD FINALLY DETERMINING JUST COMPENSATION
 FOR THE STOCK, THE AUTHORITY SHALL HAVE  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER  RECEIPT  OF
 NOTICE  OF ENTRY OF SUCH AWARD WITHIN WHICH TO ELECT TO PROCEED WITH THE
 TAKING OR TO ABANDON SUCH ACQUISITION AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION NINE OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION.  NOTICE OF SUCH  ELECTION  SHALL  BE  SERVED  BY  THE
 AUTHORITY  AND  BY  THE  STOCK TRANSFER AGENT IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED IN
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION. IF THE AUTHORITY  ELECTS  TO  PROCEED
 WITH  THE  ACQUISITION, IT SHALL DEPOSIT WITH THE SUPREME COURT IN WHICH
 THE CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING WAS HELD AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AWARD WITHIN
 ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER RECEIPT BY  THE  AUTHORITY  OF  NOTICE  OF
 ENTRY  OF  SUCH  AWARD.  UPON  THE MAKING OF SUCH DEPOSIT, THE AUTHORITY
 SHALL NOTIFY SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION'S STOCK  TRANSFER  AGENT
 IN  WRITING  OF  SUCH  DEPOSIT. THE SUM SO DEPOSITED SHALL BE APPLIED AS
 PROVIDED IN THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW. UPON MAKING  SUCH  DEPOSIT
 AND  GIVING  SUCH NOTICE TO THE STOCK TRANSFER AGENT, TITLE TO ALL STOCK
 DESCRIBED IN THE NOTICE OF TAKING SHALL IMMEDIATELY VEST IN THE AUTHORI-
 TY AND THE AUTHORITY SHALL HAVE THE  IMMEDIATE  RIGHT  THERETO.  IN  THE
 EVENT THE AUTHORITY ELECTS TO ABANDON THE ACQUISITION, THE PROVISIONS OF
 SUBDIVISION NINE OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY.
  (G)  IT  SHALL BE A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION
 FOR ANY SUCH SECURITIES THAT  SUCH  SECURITIES  BE  SURRENDERED  TO  THE
 SUPREME  COURT  OR  TO  SUCH  OTHER ENTITY, INCLUDING THE ISSUER'S STOCK
 TRANSFER AGENT, AS THE SUPREME COURT MAY DIRECT.
  6. PROCEDURE  FOR  ACQUISITION  OF  A  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY  CORPORATION
 ASSETS.  (A)  IF  THE AUTHORITY SHALL FIND IT NECESSARY OR CONVENIENT TO
 ACQUIRE ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SUCH DOWNSTATE  UTILITY  CORPO-
 RATION, OTHER THAN SECURITIES, WHETHER FOR IMMEDIATE OR FUTURE USE, THEN
 THE  AUTHORITY  NEED  NOT  DETERMINE  THAT SUCH PROPERTY IS REQUIRED FOR
 S. 1041  11

 PUBLIC USE, SINCE THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY HAS MADE SUCH DETERMINATION IN
 THIS TITLE WHICH DETERMINATION SHALL BE BINDING FOR  ALL  PURPOSES.  THE
 AUTHORITY  NEED  NOT PUBLISH ANY NOTICE OF ITS INTENTION TO ACQUIRE SUCH
 PROPERTY  OR  HOLD  ANY  PUBLIC  HEARING  WITH RESPECT THERETO OR TO THE
 PUBLIC USE OF SUCH ACTION.
  (B) WHEN ANY REAL PROPERTY OF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION WITH-
 IN THIS STATE IS SOUGHT TO BE ACQUIRED BY THE EXERCISE OF THE  POWER  OF
 EMINENT  DOMAIN, AND AFTER THE AUTHORITY SHALL HAVE ENTERED INTO NEGOTI-
 ATIONS WITH SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF  SUCH
 PROPERTY,  THE AUTHORITY SHALL CAUSE A SURVEY AND MAP TO BE MADE THEREOF
 AND SHALL CAUSE SUCH SURVEY AND MAP TO BE FILED IN ITS OFFICE AND IN THE
 OFFICE OF THE COUNTY CLERK IN WHICH  SUCH  PROPERTY  IS  LOCATED.  THERE
 SHALL  BE  ANNEXED  TO SUCH SURVEY AND MAP A CERTIFICATE EXECUTED BY THE
 CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE AUTHORITY, OR BY SUCH OTHER OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE AS
 MAY BE DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, STATING THAT THE PROPERTY OR
 INTEREST THEREIN DESCRIBED IN SUCH SURVEY AND MAP IS NECESSARY  FOR  ITS
 PURPOSES.
  (C)  UPON  FILING  SUCH SURVEY AND MAP, THE AUTHORITY SHALL PETITION A
 SPECIAL TERM OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH  THE
 PROPERTY  IS  LOCATED  FOR  THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH PROPERTY OR INTEREST
 THEREIN. SUCH PETITION SHALL DESCRIBE THE PROPERTY BEING  ACQUIRED,  THE

 THE PROCESS OF CONDEMNATION AND PAYMENT. THE PETITION SHALL  STATE  THAT
 THE  AUTHORITY WILL ELECT WHETHER OR NOT TO PAY THE AMOUNT OF SUCH AWARD
 WHEN IT HAS BEEN FINALLY DETERMINED. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS,  SUCH  PETI-
 TION  SHALL  BE  GENERALLY  IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN
 PROCEDURE LAW, SO FAR AS CONSISTENT HEREWITH.  SUCH  PETITION,  TOGETHER
 WITH  A  NOTICE  OF  PENDENCY  OF  THE PROCEEDING, SHALL BE FILED IN THE
 OFFICE OF THE COUNTY CLERK OF  THE  COUNTY  IN  WHICH  THE  PROPERTY  IS
 LOCATED  AND SHALL BE INDEXED AND RECORDED AS PROVIDED BY LAW. A COPY OF
 SUCH PETITION, TOGETHER WITH A NOTICE OF  THE  PRESENTATION  THEREOF  TO
 SUCH  SPECIAL TERM OF THE SUPREME COURT, SHALL BE SERVED UPON THE OWNERS
 OF SUCH PROPERTY AS PROVIDED IN THE EMINENT DOMAIN  PROCEDURE  LAW.  THE
 AUTHORITY MAY CAUSE A DUPLICATE ORIGINAL AFFIDAVIT OF THE SERVICE THERE-
 OF TO BE RECORDED IN THE BOOKS USED FOR RECORDING DEEDS IN THE OFFICE OF
 THE  COUNTY  CLERK OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN SUCH
 NOTICE IS LOCATED, AND THE RECORDING OF SUCH AFFIDAVIT  SHALL  BE  PRIMA

  (D)  SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE CONDUCTED GENERALLY IN THE MANNER
 PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT  THE
 PROVISIONS  THEREOF  ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE,
 IN WHICH CASE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE SHALL CONTROL.
  (E) IN ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE VALUATION OF A  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY
 CORPORATION'S  PROPERTY  TAKEN BY THE AUTHORITY, THE SUPREME COURT SHALL
 ASCERTAIN AND DETERMINE JUST COMPENSATION FOR THE PROPERTY TAKEN  AS  OF
 THE  VALUATION DATE, GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE APPLICABLE FINDINGS
 AND DETERMINATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION  OF  THIS
 SECTION.
  (F)  SHOULD A DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPORATION'S PROPERTY BE TAKEN BY THE
 EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND IF  SUCH  DOWNSTATE  UTILITY
 CORPORATION  SHALL HAVE AGREED UPON THE COMPENSATION TO BE PAID THEREFOR
 IN SETTLEMENT OF THE PROCEEDING, IF, SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY  CORPORATION
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PAYMENT OF THE AGREED OR AWARDED COMPENSATION WITH-
 IN  ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS  AFTER THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT UPON THE

 INTEREST  UPON THE AMOUNT OF SUCH COMPENSATION FROM THE TIME OF ACQUISI-
 TION THEREOF BY THE AUTHORITY TO THE DATE OF  PAYMENT  OF  SUCH  COMPEN-
 SATION; BUT SUCH INTEREST SHALL CEASE UPON THE SERVICE BY THE AUTHORITY,
 UPON  THE  PERSON  OR  CORPORATION  ENTITLED THERETO, OF A FIFTEEN DAYS'

 COMPENSATION UPON THE PRESENTATION OF PROPER PROOFS AND  VOUCHERS.  SUCH
 NOTICE  SHALL BE SERVED PERSONALLY OR BY REGISTERED MAIL AND PUBLICATION

 FOR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY  CORPORATION,  THE  AUTHORITY
 SHALL  HAVE  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER RECEIPT OF NOTICE OF ENTRY OF SUCH AWARD

 TY  CORPORATION  IN WRITING OF SUCH DEPOSIT.  THE SUM SO DEPOSITED SHALL
 BE APPLIED AS PROVIDED IN THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW. UPON  MAKING
 SUCH  DEPOSIT  AND  GIVING  SUCH NOTICE TO SUCH DOWNSTATE UTILITY CORPO-
 RATION, TITLE TO ALL PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THE NOTICE  OF  TAKING  SHALL

 AWARD, SHALL BE FILED IN THE OFFICE OF THE COUNTY CLERK OF THE COUNTY IN
 WHICH  THE  PROPERTY IS LOCATED AND SHALL BE INDEXED AND RECORDED IN THE
 SAME MANNER AS A NOTICE OF PENDENCY UNDER THE EMINENT  DOMAIN  PROCEDURE
 LAW.  THE  OWNER  OR PERSON IN POSSESSION OF SUCH PROPERTY SHALL DELIVER
 POSSESSION THEREOF TO THE AUTHORITY UPON DEMAND, AND IN CASE  POSSESSION
 IS  NOT  DELIVERED  WHEN DEMANDED OR DEMAND IS NOT CONVENIENT BECAUSE OF
 ABSENCE OF THE OWNER OR INABILITY TO LOCATE OR DETERMINE THE OWNER,  THE
 AUTHORITY  MAY  APPLY TO THE COURT WITHOUT NOTICE FOR AN ORDER REQUIRING
 THE SHERIFF TO PUT IT INTO POSSESSION OF SUCH  REAL  PROPERTY.  SUCH  AN
 ORDER  SHALL  BE EXECUTED AS IF IT WERE AN EXECUTION FOR THE DELIVERY OF
 THE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY. IN THE EVENT  THE  AUTHORITY  ELECTS  TO

 THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL  AS  SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE TAKE ALL STEPS
 NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHTS AND CLAIMS OF ALL THE HOLDERS OF ANY
 OTHER STOCK AND DEBT SECURITIES AND ALL OTHER CREDITORS THEREOF  ARE  AS
 SECURE AS THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION BY THE AUTHORI-
 S. 1041  13
 
 TY.  NOTHING  HEREIN SHALL PROHIBIT THE AUTHORITY FROM TAKING ANY APPRO-
 PRIATE AND PRUDENT ACTION TO RENEGOTIATE AND RESTRUCTURE  SUCH  DEBT  OR

 CORPORATION AT SUCH PRICES AS THE AUTHORITY MAY DETERMINE. THE AUTHORITY

  9. IF THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, THAT THE TOTAL
 COST  OF  ACQUISITION  WILL RESULT IN RATES IN EXCESS OF THE RATES WHICH

 RATION,  THE AUTHORITY SHALL ABANDON THE ACQUISITION. IN SUCH EVENT, THE

 SITION THE AUTHORITY SHALL FILE A COPY OF THE NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT WITH
