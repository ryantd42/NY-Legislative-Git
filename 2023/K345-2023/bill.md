  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Parkinson's Disease  Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
serious diseases by proclaiming official months to increase awareness of
such concerns, which affect thousands of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 2023, as Parkinson's Disease
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Parkinson's  Disease  is  a  progressive  disorder  of  the
nervous system that affects movement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United  States,  50,000-60,000  new  cases  of
Parkinson's Disease are diagnosed each year, adding to the  one  million
people who currently have Parkinson's Disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Great  strides  have  been  made  in  the  battle  against
Parkinson's Disease; Parkinson's Disease Awareness Month is committed to
fighting this horrific  disease  by  finding  better  ways  to  prevent,
detect, and provide treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Parkinson's Disease is a substantial health problem in the
State  of  New  York  and  throughout  the  United  States;  it  strikes
disproportionately  more  men,  but  also women, with the average age of
onset being around 60 years old; and
 
  WHEREAS, The symptoms of Parkinson's Disease can vary from person to
person; early signs  may  be  subtle  and  can  go  unnoticed;  symptoms
typically begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that
side even after symptoms begin to affect both sides; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People suffering with Parkinson's Disease can exhibit many
signs and symptoms including  tremors,  rigidity,  slowing  of  motions,
postural  instability,  depression,  emotional  changes, difficulty with
swallowing  and  chewing,  speech  changes,  sleep  problems,  pain  and
dementia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  there  is  no  cure  for  Parkinson's Disease, many
different types of medications and surgical options  are  available  for
its treatment; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Parkinson's
Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
