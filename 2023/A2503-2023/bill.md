 RATIONS, POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, OR MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS in  New  York

 accordance with this section.

 DAYS,  EXCLUDING  LEGAL  HOLIDAYS,  AFTER  RECEIPT OF AN INVOICE FOR THE

 THAT THERE IS REASONABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT PAYMENT MAY NOT  PROPERLY
 BE DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART;
  (B)  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIFIC STATUTORY OR CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS,
 PAYMENT MUST BE PRECEDED BY AN INSPECTION  PERIOD  OR  BY  AN  AUDIT  TO

  (C) THE NECESSARY STATE GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATION REQUIRED TO AUTHORIZE
 PAYMENT HAS YET TO BE ENACTED;
  (D) THE CASH BALANCE OF THE FUND OR SUB-FUND FROM WHICH THE PAYMENT IS

 TO PAYMENT; OR
  (F) THE GOODS OR PROPERTY HAVE NOT BEEN DELIVERED OR THE SERVICES HAVE
 NOT BEEN RENDERED BY THE CONTRACTOR IN  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  TERMS  OR

  THE  REQUIRED  PAYMENT  DATE SHALL BE FIFTEEN CALENDAR DAYS, EXCLUDING
 LEGAL HOLIDAYS,  AFTER  SUCH  CONDITIONS  DESCRIBED  IN  PARAGRAPHS  (A)
 THROUGH  (F)  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION HAVE BEEN SATISFIED OR RECTIFIED, AND
 PROVIDED FURTHER THAT ALL REASONABLE AND PRACTICABLE  EFFORTS  SHALL  BE
 TAKEN TO SATISFY OR RECTIFY SUCH CONDITIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
  10.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  supersede inconsistent
 provisions of any general, special or local law, or  the  provisions  of

  §  3.  Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 179-f of the state finance law,
 subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 36 of the laws of 2016,  subdivision
 3  as amended by chapter 568 of the laws of 2015, are amended, and three
 new subdivisions 7, 8 and 9 are added to read as follows:
  2. The required payment date shall be thirty calendar days,  excluding
 legal  holidays, provided, however, that for a small business, PREFERRED
 SOURCE, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS, OR MINORITY AND  WOMEN-
 OWNED  BUSINESS  ENTERPRISE  the  required payment date shall be fifteen
 calendar days,  excluding  legal  holidays,  absent  a  showing  by  the
 contracting  agency  of  circumstances beyond its control, provided that
 the small business submits its invoice  electronically,  in  conformance
 with the policies and procedures of the accounting and financial manage-
 ment  system of state government and identifies that it is seeking expe-
 dited payment as a small business, or in the case of final  payments  on
 highway  construction  contracts  seventy-five  calendar days, excluding
 legal holidays, after receipt of  an  invoice  for  the  amount  of  the
 contract payment due; except when:
  (a) the state comptroller in the course of his or her audit determines
 that  there is reasonable cause to believe that payment may not properly
 be due, in whole or in part;
  (b) in accordance with specific statutory or  contractual  provisions,
 payment  must  be  preceded  by  an  inspection period or by an audit to
 determine the resources applied or used by a  contractor  in  fulfilling
 the terms of the contract;
  (c) the necessary state government appropriation required to authorize
 payment has yet to be enacted;
  (d) [a proper invoice must be examined by the federal government prior
 to payment;
  (e)]  the  goods  or  property have not been delivered or the services
 have not been rendered by the contractor in compliance with the terms or
 conditions of the contract;
  [(f)] (E) the required payment date is  modified  in  accordance  with
 subdivision three of this section; or
  [(g)]  (F)  in  the  case  of  final  payments on highway construction
 contracts  the  commissioner  of  transportation  determines  that  the
 contractor  has  failed  to  properly submit the necessary documents and
 other submissions prescribed by the contract specifications and require-
 ments, by the provisions of subdivision eight of section thirty-eight of
 the highway law, and by all other applicable state and federal  laws  in
 A. 2503  3
 
 order  to  enable  the department of transportation to process the final
 payment properly and expeditiously.
  Any  time  taken  to satisfy or rectify any of the types of conditions
 described in paragraphs (a) through [(e)]  (D)  or  [(g)]  (F)  of  this
 subdivision shall extend the required payment date by an equal period of
 time,  provided,  however, that for small businesses, PREFERRED SOURCES,
 SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESSES, OR MINORITY  AND  WOMEN-OWNED
 BUSINESS  ENTERPRISES, the required payment date shall be fifteen calen-
 dar days, excluding legal holidays,  after  such  conditions  have  been
 satisfied  or  rectified,  and  provided further that all reasonable and
 practicable efforts shall be taken to satisfy or rectify such conditions
 as soon as possible.
  3. Each state agency shall have fifteen calendar days after receipt of
 an invoice by the state agency at its designated payment office,  or  in
 the case of an invoice received from a small business, PREFERRED SOURCE,
 SERVICE  DISABLED  VETERAN-OWNED  BUSINESS,  OR MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED
 BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, seven calendar days, to notify  the  contractor  of
 (a)  defects  in the delivered goods, property, or services, (b) defects
 in the invoice, or (c) suspected improprieties  of  any  kind;  and  the
 existence  of  such defects or improprieties shall prevent the commence-
 ment of the time period specified in subdivision two  of  this  section.
 When  a  state  agency  fails  to notify a contractor of such defects or
 suspected improprieties within fifteen calendar days, or seven  calendar
 days  if  such contractor is a small business, PREFERRED SOURCE, SERVICE
 DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS, OR MINORITY  AND  WOMEN-OWNED  BUSINESS
 ENTERPRISE,  of  receiving  the  invoice, the number of days allowed for
 payment of the corrected proper invoice will be reduced by the number of
 days between the fifteenth day, or seventh day if payment of such proper
 invoice is for a small  business,  PREFERRED  SOURCE,  SERVICE  DISABLED
 VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS, OR MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE,
 and  the day that notification was transmitted to the contractor. If the
 state agency, in such situations, fails to  provide  reasonable  grounds
 for  its  contention  that  a defect or impropriety exists, the required
 payment date shall be calculated from the date of receipt of an invoice.
  7. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "PREFERRED SOURCE" SHALL MEAN A  QUALIFIED

 PURPOSES BY THE COMMISSIONER  OF  THE  OFFICE  OF  CHILDREN  AND  FAMILY
