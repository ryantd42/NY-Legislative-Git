 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  amendments  to  a
  tribal-state compact with the Seneca Nation of Indians
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The state legislature  finds  that  the
 continued  operation  of  the Seneca Nation of Indians' Class III gaming
 operations will create continued economic benefit for the people of  the
 state  of New York, and further recognizes that the state and the Seneca
 Nation of Indians must negotiate a tribal-state compact in good faith in
 compliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.
 The state legislature also  acknowledges  that  the  prior  tribal-state
 compact  between  the  state  and  the  Seneca Nation of Indians granted
 certain gaming exclusivity rights  to  the  Nation,  and  that  any  new
 tribal-state  gaming compact must preserve the exclusivity rights within
 the exclusivity zone. The state legislature also finds  that  the  state
 continues  to  have  a significant interest in ensuring that any tribal-
 state compact is  consistent  with,  to  the  fullest  extent  possible,
 certain  state  laws,  including, but not limited to, the labor law, the
 workers' compensation law, and the human rights law. These laws  provide
 for  the  granting  of benefits, rights and privileges which improve the
 economic quality of life and personal safety  of  persons  who  will  be
 employed within a gaming facility either by the Nation or by any person,
 corporation,  firm or entity engaged by the Nation, to operate, adminis-
 ter or manage the gaming facility.
  § 2. Section 12 of the executive law is amended by adding a new subdi-
 vision (a-1) to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
