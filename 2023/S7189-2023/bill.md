 which  have  been  suspended  from  the  filing  requirement pursuant to

  § 3. Subsection (h) of section 2344 of the insurance law,  as  amended
 by  section  3  of item JJ of subpart B of part XXX of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  (h) This section shall cease to be of any force or effect  during  the
 period  August third, two thousand one through the day before the effec-
 tive date of the property/casualty insurance availability act, and after
 June thirtieth, two  thousand  [twenty-three]  TWENTY-SIX,  except  that
 rates shall reflect the likely reductive cost effects reasonably attrib-
 utable  to  the  statutory  provisions  specified  in  paragraph  one of
 subsection (g) of this section.
  § 4. Sections 2328 and 2329  of  the  insurance  law,  as  amended  by
 section  5 of item JJ of subpart B of part XXX of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2020, are amended to read as follows:
  § 2328. Certain motor vehicle insurance rates; prior approval. For the
 periods February first, nineteen  hundred  seventy-four  through  August
 second,  two  thousand  one,  and  the  effective  date  of  the
 property/casualty insurance availability act through June thirtieth, two
 thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX, no changes in rates,  rating  plans,
 rating  rules  and  rate  manuals applicable to motor vehicle insurance,
 including no-fault coverages under article fifty-one  of  this  chapter,
 shall  be  made effective until approved by the superintendent, notwith-
 standing any inconsistent provisions of this article; provided, however,
 that changes in such rates, rating plans, rating rules and rate  manuals
 may  be  made  effective  without such approval if the rates that result
 from such changes are no higher than the insurer's rates  last  approved
 by  the superintendent. This section shall apply only to policies cover-
 ing losses or liabilities arising out of ownership of  a  motor  vehicle
 used principally for the transportation of persons for hire, including a
 bus  or  a  school  bus  as defined in sections one hundred four and one
 hundred forty-two of the vehicle and traffic law.
  § 2329. Motor vehicle insurance rates; excess profits.  In  accordance
 with  regulations prescribed by the superintendent, each insurer issuing
 policies that are subject to article fifty-one of this chapter,  includ-
 ing  policies  of  motor  vehicle personal injury liability insurance or
 policies of motor vehicle property damage liability insurance or  insur-
 ance  for  loss  or  damage  to a motor vehicle, shall establish a fair,
 practicable, and nondiscriminatory plan for refunding or otherwise cred-
 iting to those purchasing such policies their  share  of  the  insurer's
 excess  profit,  if  any,  on such policies. An excess profit shall be a
 profit beyond a percentage rate of return on net worth  attributable  to
 such  policies,  computed  in accordance with the regulation required by
 section two thousand three hundred twenty-three  of  this  article,  and
 S. 7189  3
 
 determined by the superintendent to be so far above a reasonable average
 profit  as  to amount to an excess profit, taking into consideration the
 fact that losses or profits below a reasonable average profit  will  not
 be  recouped  from  such  policyholders. Each plan shall apply to policy
 periods for the periods January  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-four
 through  August  second, two thousand one, and the effective date of the
 property/casualty insurance availability act through June thirtieth, two
 thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX.  In prescribing such regulations the
 superintendent may limit the duration of such plans, waive any  require-
 ment for refund or credit that [he or she] THE SUPERINTENDENT determines
 to  be de minimis or impracticable, adopt forms of returns that shall be
 made to [him or her] THE SUPERINTENDENT in order to establish the amount
 of any refund or credit due, establish periods and times for the  deter-
 mination and distribution of refunds and credits, and shall provide that
 insurers  receive  appropriate  credit  against  any  refunds or credits
 required by any such plan for  policyholder  dividends  and  for  return
 premiums that may be due under rate credit or retrospective rating plans
 based on experience.
  §  5.  Paragraphs  1 and 2 and the opening paragraph of paragraph 3 of
 subsection (m) of section 3425 of  the  insurance  law,  as  amended  by
 section  4 of item JJ of subpart B of part XXX of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2020, are amended to read as follows:

 section shall not apply to any new covered policy of  automobile  insur-
 ance  voluntarily  written  on  or  after August first, nineteen hundred
 eighty-five and prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, and
 on or after August second, two thousand one and prior to  the  effective
 date  of  the  property/casualty  insurance  availability act, and on or
 after June thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-three]  TWENTY-SIX,  but  the
 legal  rights granted to insurers or policyholders under such provisions
 shall not be extinguished or impaired thereby.
  (2) In lieu of such provisions, paragraph  seven  of  subsection  (a),
 subparagraph  (A) of paragraph one of subsection (j) of this section and
 paragraph three of this subsection shall apply to such automobile insur-
 ance policies that are newly and voluntarily written to have  an  effec-
 tive  date  on  or  after August first, nineteen hundred eighty-five and
 prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-six,  and  on  or  after
 August  second,  two thousand one and prior to the effective date of the
 property/casualty insurance availability act, and on or after June thir-
 tieth, two thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX.

 January  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six,  and  on or after August
 second, two thousand  one  and  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the
 property/casualty insurance availability act, and on or after June thir-
 tieth,  two  thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX, no notice of nonrenewal
 or conditional renewal of such  covered  automobile  insurance  policies
 referred  to  in  this  subsection  shall  be issued to become effective
 during the required policy period unless it is based upon a  ground  for
 which  the  policy  could have been cancelled or unless it is based upon
 one or more of the following grounds that occurred during the thirty-six
 month period ending on the last day of the fourth  month  preceding  the
 month  of the effective date of such notice of nonrenewal or conditional
 renewal:
