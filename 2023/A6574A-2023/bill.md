 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  the limitation of overtime compensation in final average salary calcu-
  lations
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 1203 of the retirement and social security law, as
 added by section 1 of part A of chapter 504 of  the  laws  of  2009,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  §  1203. Overtime. A member's final average salary shall be calculated
 in accordance with such provisions of article eight or article eleven of
 this chapter as govern the member's benefits INCLUDING OVERTIME,  except
 that earnings classified as overtime compensation in an amount in excess
 of [fifteen] THIRTY percent of a member's annual wages not classified as
 overtime compensation shall be excluded from such calculation. "Overtime
 compensation"  shall  mean,  for  purposes of this section, compensation
 paid under any law or policy under which employees are paid  at  a  rate
 greater  than  their  standard  rate  for additional hours worked beyond
 those required, including compensation paid under  section  one  hundred
 thirty-four  of  the civil service law and section ninety of the general
 municipal law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would increase the allowable overtime compensation  included
 in  the  final  average  salary  calculation to 30 percent of a member's
 annual wages for Tier 5 and Tier 6 members in the  New  York  State  and

 Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS). The current limit is
 15 percent.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the NYSLPFRS, the increased costs would
 be shared by the State of New York and the local participating employers
 in the NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the  2024  Legislative
 Session, the increase in the present value of benefits would be approxi-
 mately $493 million.
 
 NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
 Tiers 1-5  $31 million  $75 million
 Tier 6  $462 million  $418 million
 Total  $493 million  $493 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLPFRS  is  1.0%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $8.6 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $35 million to the local participating employers.  THIS PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST  WILL  INCREASE  as  Tier  6 salary grows and will vary by employer
 based upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
