 Introduced  by M. of A. ROZIC -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Consumer Affairs and Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the  management
  and oversight of personal data
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York privacy act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  1.  Privacy is a fundamental right and an
 essential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced ramp-
 ant growth in the amount and categories of personal  data  being  gener-
 ated,  collected,  stored,  analyzed,  and  potentially  shared,  which
 presents both promise and peril. Companies collect, use  and  share  our
 personal  data  in  ways that can be difficult for ordinary consumers to
 understand. Opaque data processing policies make it impossible to evalu-
 ate risks  and  compare  privacy-related  protections  across  services,
 stifling  competition.  Algorithms  quietly make decisions with critical
 consequences for New York consumers, often with no human accountability.
 Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning people into products
 and their activity into assets. New York consumers deserve  more  notice
 and more control over their data and their digital privacy.
  2. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy.  It
 gives New York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their
 personal data and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and
 accountable  managers  of  that  information.  To achieve this, this act
 provides New York consumers a number  of  new  rights,  including  clear
 notice of how their data is being used, processed and shared; the abili-
 ty  to  access  and obtain a copy of their data in a commonly used elec-
 tronic format, with the ability to transfer  it  between  services;  the
 ability  to  correct  inaccurate  data and to delete their data; and the
 ability to challenge certain automated decisions. This act also  imposes

 obligations  upon  businesses  to  maintain reasonable data security for
 personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable harms arising
 from use of their data and to obtain specific consent for that use,  and
 to conduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not being used for
 unacceptable purposes. These data assessments can be obtained and evalu-
 ated  by the New York State Attorney General, who is empowered to obtain
 penalties for violations of this act and prevent future violations.
  § 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42 to
 read as follows:

 PURPOSE,  INCLUDING  THOSE REGARDING THE METHOD AND SCOPE OF COLLECTION,
 OF THE CONSUMER'S SENSITIVE DATA THAT MAY  BE  LESS  PROTECTIVE  OF  THE
 CONSUMER'S  SENSITIVE DATA THAN THE PROCESSING TO WHICH THE CONSUMER HAS
 PREVIOUSLY GIVEN THEIR FREELY GIVEN, SPECIFIC, INFORMED, AND UNAMBIGUOUS
 OPT-IN CONSENT.
 A. 7423  9
 
  (B) ANY REQUEST FOR CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSITIVE DATA MUST BE PROVIDED

 PROCESSING  PURPOSES,  THE RETENTION PERIOD, OR IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE,
 THE CRITERIA USED TO DETERMINE THE PERIOD, AND STATE  IF  SUCH  SHARING,
 DISCLOSURE,  TRANSFER, OR SALE ENABLES OR INVOLVES TARGETED ADVERTISING.
 THE DETAILS OF THE CATEGORIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, AND THE  CATEGORIES
 OF DATA, PROCESSING PURPOSES, AND THE RETENTION PERIOD, MAY BE SET FORTH
 IN  A  DIFFERENT  DISCLOSURE,  PROVIDED  THAT  THE  REQUEST  FOR CONSENT
 CONTAINS A CONSPICUOUS AND DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE LINK TO THAT DISCLOSURE.
  (C) TARGETED ADVERTISING AND  SALE  OF  PERSONAL  DATA  SHALL  NOT  BE
 CONSIDERED PROCESSING PURPOSES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR
 GOODS REQUESTED BY A CONSUMER.
  (D) ONCE A CONSUMER HAS PROVIDED FREELY GIVEN, SPECIFIC, INFORMED, AND
 UNAMBIGUOUS  OPT-IN  CONSENT TO PROCESS THEIR SENSITIVE DATA FOR A PROC-
 ESSING PURPOSE, A CONTROLLER MAY RELY ON SUCH CONSENT UNTIL IT IS  WITH-
 DRAWN.
  (E)  A  CONTROLLER MUST PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR A CONSUMER TO WITHDRAW
 PREVIOUSLY GIVEN CONSENT AT ANY TIME. SUCH MECHANISM SHALL  MAKE  IT  AS
 EASY FOR A CONSUMER TO WITHDRAW THEIR CONSENT AS IT IS FOR SUCH CONSUMER
 TO PROVIDE CONSENT.
  (F)  A  CONTROLLER  MUST NOT INFER THAT A CONSUMER HAS PROVIDED FREELY
 GIVEN, SPECIFIC, INFORMED,  AND  UNAMBIGUOUS  OPT-IN  CONSENT  FROM  THE
 CONSUMER'S  INACTION  OR  THE  CONSUMER'S  CONTINUED USE OF A SERVICE OR
 PRODUCT PROVIDED BY THE CONTROLLER.
  (G) CONTROLLERS MUST NOT REQUEST  CONSENT  FROM  A  CONSUMER  WHO  HAS
 PREVIOUSLY  WITHHELD  OR DENIED CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSITIVE DATA, UNTIL
 AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS AFTER A DENIAL, UNLESS CONSENT  IS  NECESSARY  TO
 PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER.
  (H) CONTROLLERS MUST TREAT USER-ENABLED PRIVACY CONTROLLERS IN A BROW-
 SER,  BROWSER  PLUG-IN, SMARTPHONE APPLICATION, OPERATING SYSTEM, DEVICE
 SETTING, OR OTHER MECHANISM THAT COMMUNICATES OR SIGNALS THE  CONSUMER'S
 CHOICES  TO OPT OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN FURTHERANCE OF
 TARGETED ADVERTISING, THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA, OR  PROFILING  IN
 FURTHERANCE  OF  DECISIONS  THAT  PRODUCE LEGAL OR SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT
 EFFECTS CONCERNING THE CONSUMER AS A DENIAL OF CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSI-
 TIVE DATA UNDER THIS ARTICLE. TO THE EXTENT  THAT  THE  PRIVACY  CONTROL
 CONFLICTS  WITH  A  CONSUMER'S  CONSENT,  THE  PRIVACY  CONTROL SETTINGS
 A. 7423  10
 
 GOVERN, UNLESS THE CONSUMER PROVIDES FREELY GIVEN,  SPECIFIC,  INFORMED,
 AND UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT TO OVERRIDE THE PRIVACY CONTROL, HOWEVER,
 THE  CONTROLLER MAY NOTIFY SUCH CONSUMER OF SUCH CONFLICT AND PROVIDE TO
 THE  CONSUMER  THE  CHOICE TO GIVE CONTROLLER-SPECIFIC CONSENT TO SUCH
 PROCESSING.
  (I) (I) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT  DISCRIMINATE  AGAINST  A  CONSUMER  FOR
 WITHHOLDING OR DENYING CONSENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BY:
  (A)  DENYING  SERVICES  OR  GOODS TO THE CONSUMER, UNLESS THE CONSUMER

 RATE FOR GOODS OR SERVICES OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR QUALITY  OF  SERVICES
 OR GOODS.
  (II)  A  CONTROLLER  SHALL NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM OFFERING A DIFFERENT
 PRICE, RATE, LEVEL, QUALITY, OR SELECTION OF  GOODS  OR  SERVICES  TO  A
 CONSUMER, INCLUDING OFFERING GOODS OR SERVICES FOR NO FEE, IF THE OFFER-
 ING  IS  IN CONNECTION WITH A CONSUMER'S VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN BONA
 FIDE  LOYALTY,  REWARDS,  PREMIUM  FEATURES,  DISCOUNTS,  OR  CLUB  CARD

 THE SALE IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE THIRD PARTY TO PROVIDE  A
 BENEFIT TO WHICH THE CONSUMER IS ENTITLED; (B) THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA
 TO  THIRD  PARTIES IS CLEARLY DISCLOSED IN THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM; AND
 (C) THE THIRD PARTY USES THE PERSONAL DATA ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF  FACILI-
 TATING  SUCH  A  BENEFIT  TO WHICH THE CONSUMER IS ENTITLED AND DOES NOT
 RETAIN OR OTHERWISE USE OR DISCLOSE THE  PERSONAL  DATA  FOR  ANY  OTHER
 PURPOSE.
  (J)  A  CONTROLLER  MAY,  WITH  THE CONSUMER'S FREELY GIVEN, SPECIFIC,
 INFORMED, AND UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT GIVEN PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION,
 OPERATE A PROGRAM IN WHICH INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR  SERVICES  SOLD  TO
 THE  CONSUMER  ARE  DISCOUNTED  BASED  SOLELY  ON  SUCH CONSUMER'S PRIOR
 PURCHASES FROM THE CONTROLLER, PROVIDED THAT ANY SENSITIVE DATA USED  TO
 OPERATE  SUCH  PROGRAM  IS PROCESSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING
 SUCH PROGRAM.
  (K) IN THE EVENT OF A MERGER, ACQUISITION, BANKRUPTCY, OR OTHER TRANS-
 ACTION IN WHICH ANOTHER ENTITY ASSUMES CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP  OF  ALL  OR
 MAJORITY  OF  THE  CONTROLLER'S  ASSETS,  ANY  CONSENT  PROVIDED  TO THE
 CONTROLLER BY A CONSUMER RELATING TO SENSITIVE DATA PRIOR TO SUCH TRANS-
 ACTION OTHER THAN CONSENT TO PROCESSING NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR
 GOODS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER, SHALL BE DEEMED WITHDRAWN.

 THE CONSUMER'S OR THEIR AGENT'S DESIGNATION WITHOUT HINDRANCE.
  6. RIGHT TO CORRECT. (A) UPON THE VERIFIED REQUEST OF  A  CONSUMER  OR
 THEIR  AGENT,  A  CONTROLLER  MUST CONDUCT A REASONABLE INVESTIGATION TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER PERSONAL DATA, THE ACCURACY OF WHICH  IS  DISPUTED  BY
 THE  CONSUMER,  IS  INACCURATE,  WITH SUCH INVESTIGATION TO BE CONCLUDED
 WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF  SUBDIVISION  EIGHT
 OF THIS SECTION.
  (B)  NOTWITHSTANDING  PARAGRAPH  (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, A CONTROLLER
 MAY TERMINATE AN INVESTIGATION INITIATED PURSUANT TO SUCH  PARAGRAPH  IF
 THE  CONTROLLER REASONABLY AND IN GOOD FAITH DETERMINES THAT THE DISPUTE

 URE  BY  A CONSUMER TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO INVESTIGATE THE
 DISPUTED PERSONAL DATA. UPON MAKING ANY DETERMINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THIS PARAGRAPH THAT A DISPUTE IS  WHOLLY  WITHOUT  MERIT,  A  CONTROLLER
 MUST,  WITHIN  THE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION
 EIGHT OF THIS SECTION, PROVIDE THE  AFFECTED  CONSUMER  A  STATEMENT  IN
 WRITING THAT INCLUDES, AT A MINIMUM, THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE DETER-
 MINATION,  AND IDENTIFICATION OF ANY INFORMATION REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE
 THE DISPUTED PERSONAL DATA, WHICH MAY CONSIST  OF  A  STANDARDIZED  FORM
 DESCRIBING THE GENERAL NATURE OF SUCH INFORMATION.
  (C)  IF,  AFTER ANY INVESTIGATION UNDER PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION OF ANY PERSONAL DATA  DISPUTED  BY  A  CONSUMER,  AN  ITEM  OF  THE
 PERSONAL  DATA  IS  FOUND  TO  BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE, OR CANNOT BE
 VERIFIED, THE CONTROLLER MUST:
  (I) CORRECT THE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE PERSONAL DATA OF THE  CONSUM-
 ER; AND
  (II)  UNLESS IT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE OR INVOLVES DISPROPORTIONATE EFFORT,
 COMMUNICATE SUCH REQUEST TO EACH PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY  TO  WHOM  THE
 CONTROLLER  DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA WITHIN ONE
 YEAR PRECEDING THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST, AND TO REQUIRE  THOSE  PROCESSORS
 OR  THIRD  PARTIES  TO  DO  THE SAME FOR ANY FURTHER PROCESSORS OR THIRD
 PARTIES THEY DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA TO.
  (D) IF THE INVESTIGATION DOES NOT RESOLVE THE  DISPUTE,  THE  CONSUMER
 MAY  FILE WITH THE CONTROLLER A BRIEF STATEMENT SETTING FORTH THE NATURE
 OF THE DISPUTE. WHENEVER A STATEMENT OF A DISPUTE IS FILED, UNLESS THERE
 EXISTS REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS  WHOLLY  WITHOUT  MERIT,
 THE CONTROLLER MUST NOTE THAT IT IS DISPUTED BY THE CONSUMER AND INCLUDE
 EITHER  THE CONSUMER'S STATEMENT OR A CLEAR AND ACCURATE CODIFICATION OR
 SUMMARY  THEREOF  WITH  THE  DISPUTED  PERSONAL  DATA  WHENEVER  IT  IS
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD TO ANY PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY.
  7.  RIGHT  TO  DELETE.  (A) UPON THE VERIFIED REQUEST OF A CONSUMER, A
 CONTROLLER MUST:
  (I) WITHIN FORTY-FIVE  DAYS  AFTER  RECEIVING  THE  VERIFIED  REQUEST,
 DELETE  ANY  OR  ALL OF THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL DATA, AS DIRECTED BY THE
 CONSUMER OR THEIR AGENT,  THAT THE CONTROLLER POSSESSES OR CONTROLS; AND
  (II) UNLESS IT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE OR INVOLVES  DISPROPORTIONATE  EFFORT
 THAT  IS  DOCUMENTED  IN  WRITING  BY  THE  CONTROLLER, COMMUNICATE SUCH
 REQUEST TO  EACH  PROCESSOR  OR  THIRD  PARTY  TO  WHOM  THE  CONTROLLER
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA WITHIN ONE YEAR PRECED-
 A. 7423  12
 
 ING  THE  CONSUMER'S  REQUEST  AND  TO REQUIRE THOSE PROCESSORS OR THIRD
 PARTIES TO DO THE SAME FOR ANY FURTHER PROCESSORS OR THIRD PARTIES  THEY
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA TO.
  (B) FOR PERSONAL DATA THAT IS NOT POSSESSED BY THE CONTROLLER BUT BY A
 PROCESSOR  OF  THE CONTROLLER, THE CONTROLLER MAY CHOOSE TO (I) COMMUNI-
 CATE THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST FOR  DELETION  TO  THE  PROCESSOR,  OR  (II)
 REQUEST  THAT  THE  PROCESSOR RETURN TO THE CONTROLLER THE PERSONAL DATA
 THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST AND DELETE  SUCH  PERSONAL
 DATA UPON RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST.
  (C) A CONSUMER'S DELETION OF THEIR ONLINE ACCOUNT MUST BE TREATED AS A
 REQUEST TO THE CONTROLLER TO DELETE ALL OF THAT CONSUMER'S PERSONAL DATA
 DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ACCOUNT.
  (D)  A  CONTROLLER  MUST  MAINTAIN  REASONABLE  PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO
 PREVENT THE REAPPEARANCE IN ITS SYSTEMS, AND IN ANY DATA  IT  DISCLOSES,
 TRANSFERS,  OR  SELLS TO ANY PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY, THE PERSONAL DATA
 THAT IS DELETED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (E) A CONTROLLER IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A  CONSUMER'S  REQUEST
 TO DELETE PERSONAL DATA IF:
  (I)  COMPLYING  WITH  THE  REQUEST  WOULD  PREVENT THE CONTROLLER FROM
 PERFORMING ACCOUNTING  FUNCTIONS,  PROCESSING  REFUNDS,  EFFECTUATING  A
 PRODUCT  RECALL PURSUANT TO FEDERAL OR STATE LAW, OR FULFILLING WARRANTY
 CLAIMS, PROVIDED THAT THE PERSONAL DATA  THAT  IS  THE  SUBJECT  OF  THE
 REQUEST IS NOT PROCESSED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN SUCH SPECIFIC ACTIV-
 ITIES; OR
  (II)  IT  IS  NECESSARY  FOR THE CONTROLLER TO MAINTAIN THE CONSUMER'S
 PERSONAL DATA TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC OR PEER-REVIEWED  SCIENTIFIC,  HISTOR-
 ICAL, OR STATISTICAL RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT ADHERES TO ALL
 OTHER APPLICABLE ETHICS AND PRIVACY LAWS, WHEN THE CONTROLLER'S DELETION
 OF  THE  INFORMATION  IS LIKELY TO RENDER IMPOSSIBLE OR SERIOUSLY IMPAIR
 THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH RESEARCH, PROVIDED THAT THE CONSUMER  HAS  GIVEN
 INFORMED  CONSENT AND THE PERSONAL DATA IS NOT PROCESSED FOR ANY PURPOSE
 OTHER THAN SUCH RESEARCH.

 ACCOUNT  THE  COMPLEXITY AND NUMBER OF THE REQUESTS. THE CONTROLLER MUST
 INFORM THE CONSUMER OF ANY SUCH  EXTENSION  WITHIN  FORTY-FIVE  DAYS  OF

 DENIAL AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO APPEAL THE DECISION.
  (B) A CONTROLLER SHALL PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AND CARRY OUT ITS
 OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISIONS FOUR THROUGH SEVEN OF THIS SECTION
 FREE OF CHARGE, AT LEAST TWICE ANNUALLY TO THE CONSUMER. WHERE  REQUESTS
 FROM  A  CONSUMER  ARE  MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED OR EXCESSIVE, IN PARTICULAR
 BECAUSE OF THEIR REPETITIVE CHARACTER, THE  CONTROLLER  MAY  EITHER  (I)
 CHARGE  A  REASONABLE FEE TO COVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF COMPLYING
 WITH THE REQUEST OR (II) REFUSE TO ACT ON THE  REQUEST  AND  NOTIFY  THE
 CONSUMER  OF  THE  REASON FOR REFUSING THE REQUEST. THE CONTROLLER BEARS

 WERE MADE BY THE CONSUMER WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE DATA, OR BY A PERSON
 LAWFULLY  EXERCISING  THE  RIGHT  ON  BEHALF  OF THE CONSUMER WHO IS THE
 SUBJECT OF THE DATA. COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS SHALL BE DETERMINED
 BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF  THE
 DATA IMPLICATED BY THE REQUEST.
  (II)  A  CONTROLLER  MAY  REQUIRE  THE  CONSUMER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION ONLY IF THE REQUEST CANNOT REASONABLY  BE  VERIFIED  WITHOUT
 THE  PROVISION  OF  SUCH  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION. A CONTROLLER MUST NOT
 TRANSFER OR PROCESS ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AND MUST DELETE ANY  SUCH  ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION  WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY AND IN ANY EVENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS
 AFTER THE CONTROLLER HAS NOTIFIED THE CONSUMER THAT IT HAS TAKEN  ACTION
 ON  A  REQUEST  UNDER SUBDIVISIONS FOUR THROUGH SEVEN OF THIS SECTION AS
 DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (III) IF A CONTROLLER DISCLOSES THIS  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION  TO  ANY
 PROCESSOR  OR  THIRD  PARTY  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  VERIFYING A CONSUMER
 REQUEST, IT MUST NOTIFY THE RECEIVING PROCESSOR OR THIRD  PARTY  AT  THE
 TIME  OF  SUCH  DISCLOSURE,  OR AS CLOSE IN TIME TO THE DISCLOSURE AS IS
 REASONABLY PRACTICABLE,  THAT  SUCH  INFORMATION  WAS  PROVIDED  BY  THE
 CONSUMER  FOR  THE  SOLE PURPOSE OF VERIFICATION AND CANNOT BE PROCESSED
 FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN VERIFICATION.
  9. IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS. CONTROLLERS MUST PROVIDE EASILY  ACCESSI-
 BLE  AND  CONVENIENT  MEANS FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER
 THIS ARTICLE.
  10. NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS. ANY PROVISION OF A CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT  OF

 FORCEABLE.

 TIVE TREATMENT OF, OR  UNLAWFUL  DISPARATE  IMPACT  ON  CONSUMERS,  (II)
 FINANCIAL,  PHYSICAL  OR REPUTATIONAL INJURY TO CONSUMERS, (III) A PHYS-
 ICAL OR OTHER INTRUSION UPON THE SOLITUDE OR SECLUSION, OR  THE  PRIVATE

 AND (D) THE PROCESSING OF SENSITIVE DATA.
  (II) DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED  PURSUANT  TO  SUBPARAGRAPH
 (I)  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH  SHALL IDENTIFY AND WEIGH THE BENEFITS THAT MAY
 FLOW, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PROCESSING  TO  THE  CONTROLLER,
 THE  CONSUMER,  OTHER  STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE POTENTIAL
 RISKS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PROCESSING,  AS
 MITIGATED BY SAFEGUARDS THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED BY THE CONTROLLER TO REDUCE
 SUCH  RISKS.  THE  CONTROLLER SHALL FACTOR INTO ANY SUCH DATA PROTECTION
 ASSESSMENT THAT USE OF DEIDENTIFIED DATA AND THE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS

 NEY GENERAL MAY  EVALUATE  THE  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  TO  ASSESS
 COMPLIANCE  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE. DATA PROTECTION ASSESS-
 MENTS SHALL BE CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL BE EXEMPT  FROM  DISCLOSURE  UNDER
 THE  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW. TO THE EXTENT ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED
 IN A DATA PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  DISCLOSURE  TO  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL
 INCLUDES  INFORMATION SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR WORK PROD-
 UCT PROTECTION, SUCH DISCLOSURE SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A  WAIVER  OF  SUCH
 PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION.
  (IV)  A SINGLE DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT MAY ADDRESS A COMPARABLE SET
 OF PROCESSING OPERATIONS THAT INCLUDE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES.
  (V) IF A CONTROLLER CONDUCTS A  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  FOR  THE
 PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH ANOTHER APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION, THE DATA
 PROTECTION ASSESSMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS ESTAB-
 LISHED  IN THIS SECTION IF SUCH DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT IS REASONABLY
 SIMILAR IN SCOPE AND EFFECT TO THE DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD
 OTHERWISE BE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  (VI) DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS SHALL APPLY TO PROCESSING
 ACTIVITIES CREATED OR GENERATED AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THIS  ARTI-
 CLE.
  (B)  CONTROLLERS MUST NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS

 OF  PERSONAL  DATA,  AND  A CONSUMER'S EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION:
  (I) DESIGNING A USER INTERFACE WITH THE PURPOSE OR SUBSTANTIAL  EFFECT
 OF  DECEIVING CONSUMERS, OBSCURING CONSUMERS' RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE,

 OF THE PERSONAL DATA AT ISSUE.
  (D) (I) A CONTROLLER SHALL LIMIT THE USE AND RETENTION OF A CONSUMER'S
 PERSONAL  DATA TO WHAT IS (A) NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS
 REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER, (B) NECESSARY FOR THE INTERNAL BUSINESS OPER-
 ATIONS OF THE CONTROLLER AND CONSISTENT WITH THE DISCLOSURES MADE TO THE
 CONSUMER PURSUANT TO SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR  (C)

  (II)  AT LEAST ANNUALLY, A CONTROLLER SHALL REVIEW ITS RETENTION PRAC-
 TICES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT IT  IS  MAINTAINING  THE  MINIMUM
 AMOUNT  OF  PERSONAL DATA AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSI-
 NESS. A CONTROLLER MUST SECURELY DISPOSE OF ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS NO
 LONGER (A) NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED  BY  THE

 SALE TO A THIRD PARTY OF PERSONAL DATA IF IT CAN REASONABLY  EXPECT  THE
 PERSONAL DATA OF A CONSUMER TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH A CONSUMER
 A. 7423  17
 
 HAS  EXERCISED  THEIR  OPT-OUT  RIGHTS  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION TWO OF
 SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR FOR  WHICH  THE  CONSUMER
 HAS  NOT  CONSENTED  TO  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION ELEVEN

 THE PROCESSOR MUST COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN CLAUSES (A)
 THROUGH  (J)  OF SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF PARAGRAPH (F) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION.
  (B) A PROCESSOR IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY  WITH  A  REQUEST  SUBMITTED
 PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE IF (I) THE CONSUMER SUBMITS THE REQUEST DIRECT-

  3.  THE  OBLIGATIONS  IMPOSED  ON CONTROLLERS OR PROCESSORS UNDER THIS

 ING PRELIMINARY RELIEF.
  (A) ANY ACTION OR SPECIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN SIX YEARS.
  (B)  EACH  INSTANCE  OF  UNLAWFUL  PROCESSING  COUNTS  AS  A  SEPARATE
 VIOLATION. UNLAWFUL PROCESSING OF THE PERSONAL DATA  OF  MORE  THAN  ONE
 CONSUMER  COUNTS  AS  A  SEPARATE  VIOLATION  AS  TO EACH CONSUMER. EACH
 PROVISION OF  THIS  ARTICLE  THAT  IS  VIOLATED  COUNTS  AS  A  SEPARATE
 VIOLATION.
  (C)  IN ASSESSING THE AMOUNT OF PENALTIES, THE COURT MUST CONSIDER ANY
 ONE OR MORE OF THE  RELEVANT  CIRCUMSTANCES  PRESENTED  BY  ANY  OF  THE
 PARTIES,  INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF
 THE MISCONDUCT, THE NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS, THE PERSISTENCE OF THE MISCON-

 BELIEVES MAY BE IN POSSESSION, CUSTODY, OR CONTROL OF ANY BOOKS, PAPERS,
 OR OTHER THINGS, OR MAY HAVE INFORMATION, RELEVANT TO ACTS OR  PRACTICES
 STATED  TO  BE  UNLAWFUL  IN THIS ARTICLE IS SUBJECT TO THE SERVICE OF A
 SUBPOENA ISSUED BY  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION.
 SERVICE  MAY  BE  MADE IN ANY MANNER THAT IS AUTHORIZED FOR SERVICE OF A
 SUBPOENA OR A SUMMONS BY THE STATE IN WHICH SERVICE IS MADE.
  4. (A) FAILURE TO  COMPLY WITH A SUBPOENA  ISSUED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 SECTION  WITHOUT REASONABLE CAUSE TOLLS THE APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMI-
 A. 7423  21
 
 TATIONS IN ANY ACTION OR SPECIAL  PROCEEDING  BROUGHT  BY  THE  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL  AGAINST THE NONCOMPLIANT PERSON THAT ARISES OUT OF THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S INVESTIGATION.
  (B)  IF  A  PERSON  FAILS TO COMPLY WITH A SUBPOENA ISSUED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY MOVE  IN  THE  SUPREME  COURT  TO
