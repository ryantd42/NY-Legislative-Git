  2.  [Examination]  SENTENCE; EXAMINATION order; psychiatric examiners.
 Upon entry of a verdict of not responsible by reason of  mental  disease
 or defect, or upon the acceptance of a plea of not responsible by reason
 of  mental  disease  or  defect, the court must immediately (A) IMPOSE A
 PERIOD OF CONFINEMENT IN THE CUSTODY OF THE COMMISSIONER WHICH IS  EQUAL
 TO  THE  SENTENCE  OF  IMPRISONMENT  SUCH  DEFENDANT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED
 PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVENTY OF THE PENAL LAW,  UPON  CONVICTION  OF  THE
 CRIME  WITH  WHICH  HE  OR SHE WAS CHARGED; AND (B) issue an examination
 order. Upon receipt of such order, the commissioner must  designate  two
 qualified  psychiatric  examiners  to conduct the examination to examine
 the defendant. In conducting their examination, the psychiatric  examin-
 ers  may  employ  any method which is accepted by the medical profession
 for the examination of persons alleged to be suffering from a  dangerous
 mental disorder or to be mentally ill or having a developmental disabil-
 ity.  The court may authorize a psychiatrist or psychologist retained by
 a defendant to be present at such examination. The clerk  of  the  court
 must  promptly  forward  a  copy  of the examination order to the mental
 hygiene legal service and such service may thereafter participate in all
 subsequent proceedings under this section.
  In all subsequent proceedings under this section, [prior to the  issu-
 ance of a special order of conditions,] the court shall consider whether
 any  order  of  protection  had  been  issued  prior to a verdict of not
 S. 1927  4
 
 responsible by reason of mental disease or defect in the case, or  prior
 to  the  acceptance  of  a  plea  of not responsible by reason of mental
 disease or defect in the case.
  2-a.  Firearm,  rifle  or  shotgun  surrender  order.  Upon entry of a
 verdict of not responsible by reason of mental  disease  or  defect,  or
 upon  the  acceptance  of  a plea of not responsible by reason of mental
 disease or defect, or upon a finding that the defendant is an  incapaci-
 tated  person  pursuant to article seven hundred thirty of this chapter,
 the court shall revoke the defendant's firearm license, if any,  inquire
 of  the defendant as to the existence and location of any firearm, rifle
 or shotgun owned or possessed by such defendant and direct the surrender
 of such firearm, rifle or shotgun pursuant to subparagraph (f) of  para-
 graph  one  of  subdivision  a  of section 265.20 and subdivision six of
 section 400.05 of the penal law.
  3. Examination order; place of examination. Upon issuing  an  examina-
 tion  order, the court must, except as otherwise provided in this subdi-
 vision, direct that the defendant be  committed  to  a  secure  facility
 designated  by  the commissioner as the place for such psychiatric exam-
 ination. The sheriff must hold the defendant  in  custody  pending  such
 designation  by  the commissioner, and when notified of the designation,
 the sheriff must promptly deliver the defendant to such secure facility.
 [When the defendant is not in custody at the time  of  such  verdict  or
 plea,  because he was previously released on bail or on his own recogni-
 zance, the court, in its discretion, may direct that such examination be
 conducted on an out-patient basis, and at such time  and  place  as  the
 commissioner  shall designate. If, however, the commissioner informs the
 court that confinement of the defendant is necessary  for  an  effective
 examination,  the  court must direct that the defendant be confined in a
 facility  designated  by  the  commissioner  until  the  examination  is
 completed.]
  4.  Examination  order,  duration.  Confinement  in  a secure facility
 pursuant to an examination order shall be for  a  period  not  exceeding
 thirty  days,  except  that,  upon  application of the commissioner, the
 court may authorize confinement for an additional period  not  exceeding
 thirty  days  when a longer period is necessary to complete the examina-
 tion. [If the initial  hearing  required  by  subdivision  six  of  this
 section  has  not commenced prior to the termination of such examination
 period, the commissioner shall retain custody of the defendant  in  such
 secure  facility  until  custody  is  transferred  to the sheriff in the
 manner prescribed in subdivision six of this section.] During the period
 of such confinement, the physician in charge of the facility may  admin-
 ister  or  cause  to  be  administered  to  the defendant such emergency
 psychiatric, medical or other therapeutic treatment as  in  his  OR  HER
 judgment  should  be  administered.  [If the court has directed that the
 examination be conducted on an out-patient basis, the examination  shall
 be  completed  within thirty days after the defendant has first reported
 to the place designated by the commissioner, except that, upon  applica-
 tion of the commissioner, the court may extend such period for a reason-
 able time if a longer period is necessary to complete the examination.]
  5.  Examination  order;  reports. After he OR SHE has completed his OR
 HER examination of the defendant, each psychiatric examiner must prompt-
 ly prepare a report of his OR HER findings and evaluation concerning the
 defendant's mental condition, and submit such report to the  commission-
 er.  If  the psychiatric examiners differ in their opinion as to whether
 the defendant is mentally ill or is suffering from  a  dangerous  mental
 disorder,  the  commissioner must designate another psychiatric examiner
 S. 1927  5
 
 to examine the defendant. Upon receipt of the examination  reports,  the
 commissioner  must  submit them to the court that issued the examination
 order. If the court is not satisfied with the findings of these  psychi-
 atric  examiners, the court may designate one or more additional psychi-
 atric examiners pursuant  to  subdivision  [fifteen]  FOURTEEN  of  this
 section.  [The court must furnish a copy of the reports to the district
 attorney, counsel  for  the  defendant  and  the  mental  hygiene  legal
 service.]
  6.  [Initial hearing; commitment] COMMITMENT order. After the examina-
 tion reports are submitted, the court must[,  within  ten  days  of  the
 receipt  of  such  reports,  conduct an initial hearing to determine the
 defendant's present mental condition. If the defendant is in the custody
 of the commissioner pursuant to an examination  order,  the  court  must
 direct  the  sheriff to obtain custody of the defendant from the commis-
 sioner and to confine the defendant pending further order of the  court,
 except that the court may direct the sheriff to confine the defendant in
 an  institution  located  near  the  place  where the court sits if that
 institution has been designated by the commissioner as suitable for  the
 temporary  and  secure  detention  of mentally disabled persons. At such
 initial hearing, the district attorney must establish to  the  satisfac-
 tion  of the court that the defendant has a dangerous mental disorder or
 is mentally ill. If the court finds that the defendant has  a  dangerous
 mental  disorder,  it must] issue a commitment order FOR THE TERM OF THE
 PERIOD OF CONFINEMENT IMPOSED, PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF  SUBDIVISION
 TWO  OF THIS SECTION, AND TO SUCH A SECURE FACILITY AS SHALL BE SUITABLE
 FOR A MENTALLY ILL PERSON OR A PERSON WITH A DANGEROUS MENTAL  DISORDER,
 AS  THE  CASE MAY BE, BASED UPON THE EXAMINATION REPORTS.  [If the court
 finds that the defendant does not have a dangerous mental  disorder  but
 is  mentally  ill,  the  provisions of subdivision seven of this section
 shall apply.]
  7. [Initial hearing civil commitment and order of conditions.  If,  at
 the  conclusion of the initial hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision
 six of this section, the court finds that the defendant is mentally  ill
 but  does  not have a dangerous mental disorder, the provisions of arti-
 cles nine or fifteen of the mental hygiene law shall apply at that stage
 of the proceedings and at all subsequent proceedings. Having found  that
 the  defendant  is mentally ill, the court must issue an order of condi-
 tions and an order committing  the  defendant  to  the  custody  of  the
 commissioner. The latter order shall be deemed an order made pursuant to
 the  mental  hygiene  law  and not pursuant to this section, and further
 retention, conditional release or discharge of such defendant  shall  be
 in  accordance with the provisions of the mental hygiene law. If, at the
 conclusion of the initial hearing, the court finds  that  the  defendant
 does  not  have a dangerous mental disorder and is not mentally ill, the
 court must discharge the defendant either unconditionally or subject  to
 an order of conditions.
  7-a.  Whenever the court issues a special order of conditions pursuant
 to this section, the commissioner shall make reasonable efforts to noti-
 fy the victim or victims or the designated witness or witnesses  that  a
 special  order of conditions containing such provisions has been issued,
 unless such victim or witness has requested that such notice should  not
 be provided.
  8.]  First  retention order. When a defendant is in the custody of the
 commissioner pursuant to a commitment order, the commissioner  must,  at
 least  thirty  days  prior to the expiration of the period prescribed in
 the order, apply to the court that issued the order, or  to  a  superior
 S. 1927  6

 court  in  the  county where the secure facility is located, for a first
 retention order or a release order. The commissioner must  give  written
 notice of the application to the district attorney, the defendant, coun-
 sel  for  the  defendant,  and  the  mental  hygiene legal service. Upon
 receipt of such application, the court may, on its own motion, conduct a
 hearing to determine whether the defendant has a dangerous mental disor-
 der, and it must conduct such hearing if a demand therefor  is  made  by
 the  district attorney, the defendant, counsel for the defendant, or the
 mental hygiene legal service within ten days from the date  that  notice
 of  the  application  was given to them. If such a hearing is held on an
 application for retention, the commissioner must establish to the satis-
 faction of the court that the defendant has a dangerous mental  disorder
 or  is  mentally  ill. The district attorney shall be entitled to appear
 and present evidence at such hearing. If such a hearing is  held  on  an
 application  for  release,  the  district attorney must establish to the
 satisfaction of the court that the  defendant  has  a  dangerous  mental
 disorder or is mentally ill. If the court finds that the defendant has a
 dangerous  mental disorder it must issue a first retention order. If the
 court finds that the defendant is mentally  ill  but  does  not  have  a
 dangerous  mental  disorder,  it must issue a first retention order and,
 pursuant to subdivision [eleven] TEN of this section, a  transfer  order
 and  an  order of conditions. If the court finds that the defendant does
 not have a dangerous mental disorder and is not mentally  ill,  it  must
 issue a release order and an order of conditions pursuant to subdivision
 [twelve] ELEVEN of this section.
  [9.] 8. Second and subsequent retention orders. When a defendant is in
 the custody of the commissioner pursuant to a first retention order, the
 commissioner  must,  at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the
 period prescribed in the order, apply  to  the  court  that  issued  the
 order,  or  to  a  superior  court  in  the county where the facility is
 located, for a second retention order or a release  order.  The  commis-
 sioner  must  give  written  notice  of  the application to the district
 attorney, the defendant, counsel  for  the  defendant,  and  the  mental
 hygiene  legal service. Upon receipt of such application, the court may,
 on its own motion, conduct a hearing to determine whether the  defendant
 has  a  dangerous mental disorder, and it must conduct such hearing if a
 demand therefor is made by the district attorney, the defendant, counsel
 for the defendant, or the mental hygiene legal service within  ten  days
 from  the date that notice of the application was given to them. If such
 a hearing is held on an application for retention, the commissioner must
 establish to the satisfaction of the court  that  the  defendant  has  a
 dangerous  mental  disorder  or  is  mentally ill. The district attorney
 shall be entitled to appear and present evidence  at  such  hearing.  If
 such  a  hearing  is  held  on  an application for release, the district
 attorney must establish to  the  satisfaction  of  the  court  that  the
 defendant  has  a  dangerous  mental disorder or is mentally ill. If the
 court finds that the defendant has a dangerous mental disorder  it  must
 issue a second retention order. If the court finds that the defendant is
 mentally  ill  but  does  not  have a dangerous mental disorder, it must
 issue a second retention order and, pursuant to subdivision [eleven] TEN
 of this section, a transfer order and an order  of  conditions.  If  the
 court finds that the defendant does not have a dangerous mental disorder
 and  is  not mentally ill, it must issue a release order and an order of
 conditions pursuant to subdivision [twelve] ELEVEN of this section. When
 a defendant is in the custody of the commissioner prior to  the  expira-
 tion  of  the  period prescribed in a second retention order, the proce-
 S. 1927  7
 
 dures set forth in  this  subdivision  for  the  issuance  of  a  second
 retention order shall govern the application for and the issuance of any
 subsequent retention order.
  [10.]  9.  Furlough  order.  The commissioner may apply for a furlough
 order, pursuant to this subdivision, when a defendant is in his  OR  HER
 custody  pursuant  to  a  [commitment  order,]  recommitment order[,] or
 retention order and the commissioner is of  the  view  that,  consistent
 with  the  public safety and welfare of the community and the defendant,
 the clinical condition of the defendant warrants a granting of the priv-
 ileges authorized by a furlough order. The application  for  a  furlough
 order may be made to the court that issued the commitment order, or to a
 superior  court  in the county where the secure facility is located. The
 commissioner must give ten days written notice to the district attorney,
 the defendant, counsel for the defendant, and the mental  hygiene  legal
 service.  Upon  receipt  of  such application, the court may, on its own
 motion, conduct a hearing to determine whether the application should be
 granted, and must conduct such hearing if a demand therefor is  made  by
 the  district  attorney.  If  the  court  finds  that  the issuance of a
 furlough order is consistent with the public safety and welfare  of  the
 community  and  the  defendant,  and  that the clinical condition of the
 defendant warrants a granting of the privileges authorized by a furlough
 order, the court must grant the application and issue a  furlough  order
 containing  any  terms  and conditions that the court deems necessary or
 appropriate. If the defendant fails to return to the secure facility  at
 the time specified in the furlough order, then, for purposes of subdivi-
 sion  [nineteen]  EIGHTEEN of this section, he OR SHE shall be deemed to
 have escaped.
  [11.] 10. Transfer order and order of conditions. The commissioner may
 apply for a transfer order, pursuant to this subdivision, when a defend-
 ant is in his OR HER custody pursuant to a retention order or  a  recom-
 mitment  order,  and  the commissioner is of the view that the defendant
 does not have a dangerous mental disorder or that, consistent  with  the
 public  safety and welfare of the community and the defendant, the clin-
 ical condition of the defendant warrants his  OR  HER  transfer  from  a
 secure  facility  to a non-secure facility under the jurisdiction of the
 commissioner or to any non-secure facility designated by the commission-
 er. The application for a transfer order may be made to the  court  that
 issued  the  order under which the defendant is then in custody, or to a
 superior court in the county where the secure facility is  located.  The
 commissioner must give ten days written notice to the district attorney,
 the  defendant,  counsel for the defendant, and the mental hygiene legal
 service. Upon receipt of such application, the court  may,  on  its  own
 motion, conduct a hearing to determine whether the application should be
 granted, and must conduct such hearing if the demand therefor is made by
 the  district  attorney.  At  such  hearing,  the district attorney must
 establish to the satisfaction of the court  that  the  defendant  has  a
 dangerous  mental  disorder  or that the issuance of a transfer order is
 inconsistent with the public safety and welfare of  the  community.  The
 court must grant the application and issue a transfer order if the court
 finds  that  the defendant does not have a dangerous mental disorder, or
 if the court finds that the issuance of a transfer order  is  consistent
 with  the  public  safety and welfare of the community and the defendant
 and that the clinical condition of the defendant, warrants  his  OR  HER
 transfer  from  a secure facility to a non-secure facility. A court must
 also issue a transfer order when, in connection with an application  for
 a  first  retention  order pursuant to subdivision [eight] SEVEN of this
 S. 1927  8
 
 section or a second or subsequent retention order pursuant  to  subdivi-
 sion [nine] EIGHT of this section, it finds that a defendant is mentally
 ill  but  does  not  have a dangerous mental disorder.  Whenever a court
 issues a transfer order it must also issue an order of conditions.
  [12.]  11. Release order and order of conditions. The commissioner may
 apply for a release order, pursuant to this subdivision, when a  defend-
 ant  is in his OR HER custody pursuant to a retention order or recommit-
 ment order, and the commissioner is of the view that  the  defendant  no
 longer  has  a  dangerous mental disorder and is no longer mentally ill.
 The application for a release order may be made to the court that issued
 the order under which the defendant is then in custody, or to a superior
 court in the county where the facility is located. The application  must
 contain  a  description of the defendant's current mental condition, the
 past course of treatment, a history of the  defendant's  conduct  subse-
 quent  to  his  OR  HER commitment, a written service plan for continued
 treatment which shall include the information specified  in  subdivision
 (g) of section 29.15 of the mental hygiene law, and a detailed statement
 of  the  extent  to  which supervision of the defendant after release is
 proposed. The commissioner must give ten  days  written  notice  to  the
 district  attorney,  the  defendant,  counsel for the defendant, and the
 mental hygiene legal service. Upon  receipt  of  such  application,  the
 court must promptly conduct a hearing to determine the defendant's pres-
 ent  mental  condition.  At  such  hearing, the district attorney must
 establish to the satisfaction of the court  that  the  defendant  has  a
 dangerous  mental  disorder  or is mentally ill. If the court finds that
 the defendant has a dangerous mental disorder, it must deny the applica-
 tion for a release order. If the court finds that the defendant does not
 have a dangerous mental disorder but is mentally ill, it  must  issue  a
 transfer  order  pursuant to subdivision [eleven] TEN of this section if
 the defendant is then confined in a secure facility. If the court  finds
 that  the defendant does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is not
 mentally ill, it must grant the application and issue a release order. A
 court must also issue a release order when, in connection with an appli-
 cation for a first retention order pursuant to subdivision [eight] SEVEN
 of this section or a second or subsequent retention  order  pursuant  to
 subdivision  [nine]  EIGHT  of this section, it finds that the defendant
 does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is not mentally ill. When-
 ever a court issues a release order it  must  also  issue  an  order  of
 conditions.  If  the court has previously issued a transfer order and an
 order of conditions, it must issue a new order of conditions upon  issu-
 ing  a release order. The order of conditions issued in conjunction with
 a release order shall incorporate a written service plan prepared  by  a
 psychiatrist  familiar with the defendant's case history and approved by
 the court, and shall contain any conditions that the court determines to
 be reasonably necessary or appropriate. It shall be  the  responsibility
 of  the  commissioner  to determine that such defendant is receiving the
 services specified in the written service plan and is complying with any
 conditions specified in such plan and the order of conditions.
  [13.] 12. Discharge order. The commissioner may apply for a  discharge
 order,  pursuant  to this subdivision, when a defendant has been contin-
 uously on an out-patient status for three years or more  pursuant  to  a
 release order, and the commissioner is of the view that the defendant no
 longer has a dangerous mental disorder and is no longer mentally ill and
 that  the  issuance  of  a discharge order is consistent with the public
 safety and welfare of the community and the defendant.  The  application
 for  a  discharge order may be made to the court that issued the release
 S. 1927  9
 
 order, or to a superior court in the county where the defendant is  then
 residing.  The  commissioner  must  give  ten days written notice to the
 district attorney, the defendant, counsel for  the  defendant,  and  the
 mental  hygiene  legal  service.  Upon  receipt of such application, the
 court may, on its own motion, conduct a hearing to determine whether the
 application should be granted, and must conduct such hearing if a demand
 therefor is made by the district attorney.  The  court  must  grant  the
 application  and  issue  a  discharge  order if the court finds that the
 defendant has been continuously on an out-patient status for three years
 or more, that he OR SHE does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is
 not mentally ill, and that  the  issuance  of  the  discharge  order  is
 consistent  with  the public safety and welfare of the community and the
 defendant.
  [14.] 13. Recommitment order. At any time during the period covered by
 an order of conditions an application may be made by the commissioner or
 the district attorney to the court that issued such order, or to a supe-
 rior court in the county where the defendant is  then  residing,  for  a
 recommitment  order when the applicant is of the view that the defendant
 has a dangerous mental disorder. The applicant must give written  notice
 of  the application to the defendant, counsel for the defendant, and the
 mental hygiene legal service, and if the applicant is  the  commissioner
 he  OR  SHE  must  give  such  notice to the district attorney or if the
 applicant is the district attorney he OR SHE must give  such  notice  to
 the  commissioner. Upon receipt of such application the court must order
 the defendant to appear before it for a  hearing  to  determine  if  the
 defendant has a dangerous mental disorder. Such order may be in the form
 of a written notice, specifying the time and place of appearance, served
 personally  upon  the  defendant,  or  mailed  to  his OR HER last known
 address, as the court may direct.  If the defendant fails to  appear  in
 court as directed, the court [may] SHALL issue a warrant to an appropri-
 ate peace officer directing him OR HER to take the defendant into custo-
 dy  and  bring  him  OR  HER before the court. In such circumstance, the
 court [may] SHALL direct that the defendant be confined in an  appropri-
 ate  institution  located near the place where the court sits. The court
 must conduct a hearing to determine whether the defendant has a  danger-
 ous  mental  disorder. At such hearing, the applicant, whether he OR SHE
 be the commissioner or the  district  attorney  must  establish  to  the
 satisfaction  of  the  court  that  the defendant has a dangerous mental
 disorder. If the applicant is the commissioner,  the  district  attorney
 shall be entitled to appear and present evidence at such hearing; if the
 applicant  is  the district attorney, the commissioner shall be entitled
 to appear and present evidence at such hearing. If the court finds  that
 the defendant has a dangerous mental disorder, it must issue a recommit-
 ment  order.  When  a  defendant  is  in the custody of the commissioner
 pursuant to a recommitment order, the procedures set forth  in  subdivi-
 sions  SEVEN  AND  eight  [and nine] of this section for the issuance of
 retention orders shall govern the application for and the issuance of  a
 first  retention  order,  a  second  retention  order,  and  subsequent
 retention orders.
  [15.] 14. Designation of psychiatric examiners.  If,  at  any  hearing
 conducted under this section to determine the defendant's present mental
 condition, the court is not satisfied with the findings of the psychiat-
 ric examiners, the court may direct the commissioner to designate one or
 more  additional  psychiatric examiners to conduct an examination of the
 defendant and submit a report of their findings. In addition, the  court
 may  on its own motion, or upon request of a party, may designate one or
 S. 1927  10
 
 more psychiatric examiners to examine the defendant and submit a  report
 of  their  findings. The district attorney may apply to the court for an
 order directing that the defendant submit to an examination by a psychi-
 atric examiner designated by the district attorney, and such psychiatric
 examiner may testify at the hearing.
  [16.] 15. Rehearing and review. Any defendant who is in the custody of
 the commissioner pursuant to [a commitment order,] a retention order, or
 a recommitment order, if dissatisfied with such order, may, within thir-
 ty days after the making of such order, obtain a rehearing and review of
 the  proceedings  and of such order in accordance with the provisions of
 section 9.35 or 15.35 of the mental hygiene law.
  [17.] 16.  Rights  of  defendants.  Subject  to  the  limitations  and
 provisions  of this section, a defendant committed to the custody of the
 commissioner pursuant to this section shall have the rights  granted  to
 patients under the mental hygiene law.
  [18.]  17.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law, no person
 confined by reason  of  a  [commitment  order,]  recommitment  order  or
 retention  order  to  a  secure  facility  may be discharged or released
 unless the commissioner shall deliver written notice, at least four days
 excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, in advance of such  discharge
 or release to all of the following:
  (a) the district attorney.
  (b) the police department having jurisdiction of the area to which the
 defendant is to be discharged or released.
  (c) any other person the court may designate.
  The notices required by this subdivision shall be given by the facili-
 ty staff physician who was treating the defendant or, if unavailable, by
 the  defendant's  treatment  team  leader, but if neither is immediately
 available, notice must be given by some other  member  of  the  clinical
 staff of the facility. Such notice must be given by any means reasonably
 calculated to give prompt actual notice.
  [19.]  18. Escape from custody; notice requirements. If a defendant is
 in the custody of the commissioner pursuant to  an  order  issued  under
 this  section, and such defendant escapes from custody, immediate notice
 of such escape shall be given by the department facility staff  to:  (a)
 the  district  attorney, (b) the superintendent of state police, (c) the
 sheriff of the county where the escape occurred, (d) the police  depart-
 ment  having jurisdiction of the area where the escape occurred, (e) any
 person the facility staff believes to be in  danger,  and  (f)  any  law
 enforcement  agency  and any person the facility staff believes would be
 able to apprise such endangered person that the  defendant  has  escaped
 from  the  facility.  Such notice shall be given as soon as the facility
 staff know that the defendant has escaped from the  facility  and  shall
 include  such  information as will adequately identify the defendant and
 the person or persons believed to be in danger and  the  nature  of  the
 danger.  The  notices required by this subdivision shall be given by the
 facility staff physician who was treating the defendant or, if  unavail-
 able,  by the defendant's treatment team leader, but if neither is imme-
 diately available, notice must be given by  some  other  member  of  the
 clinical  staff  of the facility. Such notice must be given by any means
 reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice. The defendant may be
 apprehended, restrained, transported to, and returned  to  the  facility
 from  which he escaped by any peace officer, and it shall be the duty of
 the officer to assist any representative of the commissioner to take the
 defendant into custody upon the request of such representative.

  [20.] 19. Required affidavit.  No  application  may  be  made  by  the
 commissioner  under  this section without an accompanying affidavit from
 at least one psychiatric examiner supportive of relief requested in  the
 application,  which affidavit shall be served on all parties entitled to
 receive  the  notice  of application. Such affidavit shall set forth the
 defendant's clinical diagnosis, a detailed analysis of his or her mental
 condition which caused the psychiatric examiner to formulate an opinion,
 and the opinion of the psychiatric examiner with respect to the  defend-
 ant.  Any  application submitted without the required affidavit shall be
 dismissed by the court.
  [21.] 20. Appeals. (a) A party to proceedings conducted in  accordance
 with  the provisions of this section may take an appeal to an intermedi-
 ate appellate court by permission of the intermediate appellate court as
 follows:
  (i) the commissioner may appeal  from  any  release  order,  retention
 order,  transfer  order, discharge order, order of conditions, or recom-
 mitment order, for which he OR SHE has not applied;
  (ii) a defendant, or the mental hygiene legal service on  his  or  her
 behalf,  may appeal from any [commitment order,] retention order, recom-
 mitment order, or, if the defendant has obtained a rehearing and  review
 of  any  such  order  pursuant  to subdivision [sixteen] FIFTEEN of this
 section, from an order, not otherwise appealable as of right, issued  in
 accordance  with  the  provisions of section 9.35 or 15.35 of the mental
 hygiene law authorizing continued retention under  the  original  order,
 provided,  however, that a defendant who takes an appeal from a [commit-
 ment order,] retention order, or recommitment order may not subsequently
 obtain a rehearing and review of  such  order  pursuant  to  subdivision
 [sixteen] FIFTEEN of this section;
  (iii)  the district attorney may appeal from any release order, trans-
 fer order, discharge order, order  of  conditions,  furlough  order,  or
 order  denying  an  application for a recommitment order which he OR SHE
 opposed.
  (b) An aggrieved party may appeal from a final order of the intermedi-
 ate appellate court to the court of appeals by permission of the  inter-
 mediate  appellate  court  granted  before  application  to the court of
 appeals, or by permission of the court of appeals upon  refusal  by  the
 intermediate appellate court or upon direct application.
  (c)  An  appeal  taken under this subdivision shall be deemed civil in
 nature, and shall be governed by the laws and rules applicable to  civil
 appeals;  provided, however, that a stay of the order appealed from must
 be obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)  [hereof]
 OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (d)  The  court  from  or  to  which  an  appeal is taken may stay all
 proceedings to enforce the order appealed  from  pending  an  appeal  or
 determination  on  a  motion  for  permission  to appeal, or may grant a
 limited stay, except that only the court to which an appeal is taken may
 vacate, limit, or  modify  a  stay  previously  granted.  If  the  order
 appealed  from is affirmed or modified, the stay shall continue for five
 days after service upon the appellant of  the  order  of  affirmance  or
 modification  with  notice of its entry in the court to which the appeal
 was taken. If a motion is made for permission to  appeal  from  such  an
 order,  before  the  expiration of the five days, the stay, or any other
 stay granted pending determination  of  the  motion  for  permission  to
 appeal, shall:
  (i)  if  the  motion  is  granted,  continue until five days after the
 appeal is determined; or
 S. 1927  12

  (ii) if the motion is denied,  continue  until  five  days  after  the
 movant is served with the order of denial with notice of its entry.
  [22.]  21. Any special order of conditions issued pursuant to subpara-
 graph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (o) of subdivision one  of  this  section
 shall  bear  in  a  conspicuous manner the term "special order of condi-
 tions" and a copy shall be filed by the clerk  of  the  court  with  the
 sheriff's  office in the county in which anyone intended to be protected
 by such special order resides, or, if anyone intended to be protected by
 such special order resides within a city, with the police department  of
 such  city.  The  absence  of  language specifying that the order is a
 "special order of conditions" shall not  affect  the  validity  of  such
 order.  A copy of such special order of conditions may from time to time
 be filed by the clerk of the court with any other police  department  or
 sheriff's  office  having  jurisdiction of the residence, work place, or
 school of anyone intended to be protected by such special order. A  copy
 of  such  special  order  may  also  be  filed  by anyone intended to be
 protected by such provisions at the  appropriate  police  department  or
 sheriff's  office having jurisdiction. Any subsequent amendment or revo-
 cation of such special order may be filed in the same manner as provided
 in this subdivision.  Such special order of  conditions  shall  plainly
 state the date that the order expires.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a  law  and  shall  apply  to
 criminal offenses committed on or after such date.
