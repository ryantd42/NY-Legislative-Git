 graph (k) as added by section 43 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws  of
 2008, is amended to read as follows:
  9-a.  (a)  (I)  As a condition for participation in pool distributions
 authorized pursuant to this section  and  section  twenty-eight  hundred
 seven-w  of  this  article  for  periods on and after January first, two
 thousand nine, general hospitals shall, effective  for  periods  on  and
 after  January first, two thousand [seven, establish] TWENTY-FIVE, ADOPT
 AND IMPLEMENT THE UNIFORM financial [aid  policies  and  procedures,  in
 accordance with the provisions of this subdivision,] ASSISTANCE FORM AND
 POLICY,  TO  BE  DEVELOPED  AND ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER. THIS SECTION
 SHALL APPLY TO ANY GENERAL HOSPITAL INCLUDING ANY  AFFILIATED  PROVIDERS
 OR  ENTITY  ACTING  ON  THE  GENERAL HOSPITAL'S OR AFFILIATED PROVIDER'S
 BEHALF, AND SHALL INCLUDE ANY THIRD PARTY OR AGENT THEREOF IF  THE  DEBT
 IS  TRANSFERRED OR SOLD.  AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "AFFILIATED PROVIDER"
 MEANS A PROVIDER THAT IS BILLING FOR MEDICAL GOODS OR SERVICES THAT WERE
 DELIVERED AT A GENERAL HOSPITAL THAT IS: (A) EMPLOYED BY  THE  HOSPITAL;
 (B)  UNDER A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH THE HOSPITAL; OR (C) A
 CLINICAL FACULTY MEMBER OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL OR OTHER SCHOOL THAT  TRAINS
 INDIVIDUALS  TO BE PROVIDERS AND THAT IS AFFILIATED WITH THE HOSPITAL OR

 FORM for reducing GENERAL HOSPITAL charges otherwise applicable to  low-
 income  individuals  [without  health  insurance,  or who have exhausted
 their health insurance benefits, and] who can demonstrate  an  inability
 to  pay full charges, and also, at the hospital's discretion, for reduc-
 ing or discounting the collection of  co-pays  and  deductible  payments
 from  those  individuals  who  can  demonstrate an inability to pay such
 amounts. IMMIGRATION STATUS SHALL NOT BE AN  ELIGIBILITY  CRITERION  FOR
 THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (II)  A  GENERAL HOSPITAL MAY USE THE NEW YORK STATE OF HEALTH MARKET-
 PLACE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PAGE TO ESTABLISH THE  PATIENT'S  HOUSE-
 HOLD  INCOME  AND  RESIDENCY  IN LIEU OF THE FINANCIAL APPLICATION FORM,
 PROVIDED IT HAS SECURED THE CONSENT OF THE PATIENT. A  GENERAL  HOSPITAL
 SHALL  NOT  REQUIRE A PATIENT TO APPLY FOR COVERAGE THROUGH THE NEW YORK
 STATE OF HEALTH MARKETPLACE  IN  ORDER  TO  RECEIVE  CARE  OR  FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE.
  (III)  UPON SUBMISSION OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION FORM, THE PATIENT IS
 NOT LIABLE FOR ANY BILLS AND NO INTEREST MAY ACCRUE  UNTIL  THE  GENERAL
 HOSPITAL  HAS  RENDERED A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (b) [Such]  THE  reductions  from  charges  for  [uninsured]  patients
 DESCRIBED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION with incomes below [at
 least three] SIX hundred percent of  the  federal  poverty  level  shall
 result in a charge to such individuals that does not exceed [the greater
 of]  the  amount that would have been paid for the same services [by the
 "highest volume payor" for such general hospital as defined in  subpara-
 graph  (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title
 XVIII of the federal social security act (medicare),  or  for  services]
 provided  pursuant  to  title [XIX] XVIII of the federal social security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such [amounts] AMOUNT shall be
 adjusted according to income level as follows:
  (i) For patients with incomes at or below [at least one]  TWO  hundred
 percent  of  the  federal  poverty level, the hospital shall [collect no
 more than a nominal payment amount, consistent  with  guidelines  estab-
 lished  by the commissioner] WAIVE ALL CHARGES. NO NOMINAL PAYMENT SHALL
 BE COLLECTED;
 S. 1366--B  3
 
  (ii) For patients with  incomes  [between  at  least  one]  ABOVE  TWO
 hundred  [one]  percent  and [one] UP TO FOUR hundred [fifty] percent of
 the federal poverty level, the hospital shall collect no more  than  the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 ule under which patients with lower incomes shall pay the lowest amount.
 [Such]  THE  schedule  shall  provide  that  the amount the hospital may
 collect for [such patients]  THE  PATIENT  increases  from  the  nominal
 amount  described  in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph in equal incre-
 ments as the income of the patient increases, up to a maximum of  twenty
 percent of the [greater of the] amount that would have been paid for the
 same  services [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital,
 as defined in subparagraph  (v)  of  this  paragraph,  or  for  services
 provided  pursuant  to  title  XVIII  of the federal social security act
 (medicare) or for services] provided pursuant to title  [XIX]  XVIII  of
 the  federal social security act (medicaid). AFTER RECEIPT OF THIRTY-SIX
 MONTHS OF PAYMENT AT THE AGREED UPON AMOUNT, THE PATIENT'S BILL SHALL BE
 CONSIDERED PAID IN FULL AND ANY AND ALL  COLLECTION  ACTIVITIES  ON  ANY
 BALANCE THAT REMAINS UNPAID SHALL BE PROHIBITED;
  (iii)  [For  patients with incomes between at least one hundred fifty-
 one percent and two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty  level,
 the  hospital  shall  collect  no  more than the amount identified after
 application of a proportional sliding fee schedule under which  patients
 with  lower  income  shall  pay  the lowest amounts. Such schedule shall
 provide that the amount the  hospital  may  collect  for  such  patients
 increases  from the twenty percent figure described in subparagraph (ii)
 of this paragraph in equal increments  as  the  income  of  the  patient
 increases,  up to a maximum of the greater of the amount that would have
 been paid for the same services by the "highest volume payor"  for  such
 general  hospital,  as defined in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or
 for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social
 security  act  (medicare) or for services provided pursuant to title XIX
 of the federal social security act (medicaid); and
  (iv)] For patients with incomes [between at least two  hundred  fifty-
 one  percent and three hundred] ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT AND UP TO SIX
 HUNDRED percent of the federal poverty level, the hospital shall collect
 no more than the [greater of the] amount that would have been  paid  for
 the same services [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospi-
 tal  as  defined  in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services
 provided pursuant to title XVIII of  the  federal  social  security  act
 (medicare),  or  for services] provided pursuant to title [XIX] XVIII of
 the federal social security  act  (medicaid).  AFTER  RECEIPT  OF  SIXTY
 MONTHS OF PAYMENT AT THE AGREED UPON AMOUNT, THE PATIENT'S BILL SHALL BE
 CONSIDERED  PAID  IN  FULL  AND ANY AND ALL COLLECTION ACTIVITIES ON ANY
 BALANCE THAT REMAINS UNPAID SHALL BE PROHIBITED.
  [(v) For the purposes of this paragraph, "highest volume payor"  shall
 mean  the  insurer,  corporation  or organization licensed, organized or
 certified pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-two  or  forty-three  of
 the insurance law or article forty-four of this chapter, or other third-
 party  payor,  which  has  a  contract  or  agreement  to pay claims for
 services provided by the  general  hospital  and  incurred  the  highest
 volume of claims in the previous calendar year.
  (vi)  A  hospital may implement policies and procedures to permit, but
 not require, consideration on a case-by-case basis of exceptions to  the
 requirements  described  in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph
 based upon the existence of significant assets owned by the patient that
 should be taken into account  in  determining  the  appropriate  payment
 S. 1366--B  4

 amount  for  that  patient's care, provided, however, that such proposed
 policies and procedures  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  review  and
 approval  of the commissioner and, if approved, shall be included in the
 hospital's  financial  assistance  policy  established  pursuant to this
 section, and provided further that, if such  approval  is  granted,  the
 maximum amount that may be collected shall not exceed the greater of the
 amount  that  would have been paid for the same services by the "highest
 volume payor" for such general hospital as defined in  subparagraph  (v)
 of  this  paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title XVIII of
 the federal social security act (medicare),  or  for  services  provided
 pursuant  to title XIX of the federal social security act (medicaid). In
 the event that a general hospital reviews a patient's assets  in  deter-
 mining  payment  adjustments  such  policies  and  procedures  shall not
 consider as assets a patient's primary residence, assets held in a  tax-
 deferred  or  comparable  retirement  savings  account,  college savings
 accounts, or cars used  regularly  by  a  patient  or  immediate  family
 members.
  (vii)]  (C) Nothing in this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION shall be construed
 to limit a hospital's  ability  to  establish  patient  eligibility  for
 payment  discounts  at  income levels higher than those specified herein
 and/or to provide greater payment discounts for eligible  patients  than
 those required by this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION.
  [(c)  Such  policies and procedures shall be clear, understandable, in
 writing and publicly available in summary form and each] (D) EACH gener-
 al hospital participating in the pool shall ensure that every patient is
 made aware of the  existence  of  [such  policies  and  procedures]  THE
 UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM AND POLICY and is provided, in a time-
 ly  manner,  with a [summary] COPY of [such policies and procedures upon
 request] THE POLICY AND FORM AT INTAKE, ADMISSION, AND DISCHARGE.  [Any
 summary  provided  to  patients  shall,  at  a minimum, include specific
 information as to  income  levels  used  to  determine  eligibility  for
 assistance,  a  description  of the primary service area of the hospital
 and the means of applying for assistance.  For  general  hospitals  with
 twenty-four  hour emergency departments, such policies and procedures] A
 PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTIONS  PROCESS  MUST  ALSO  BE  MADE
 AVAILABLE.  A  GENERAL  HOSPITAL  shall  [require  the  notification  of
 patients] NOTIFY PATIENTS BY PROVIDING WRITTEN MATERIALS TO PATIENTS  OR
 THEIR  AUTHORIZED  REPRESENTATIVES  during  the  intake and registration
 process, BY MAKING MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN CONSPICUOUS LOCATIONS  IN  THE
 HOSPITAL INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, WAITING AREAS AND OTHER PLACES
 PATIENTS  CONGREGATE, through the conspicuous posting of language-appro-
 priate information in the general hospital, and BY INCLUDING information
 on bills and statements sent to patients, that financial  [aid]  ASSIST-
 ANCE  may  be  available to qualified patients and how to obtain further
 information. [For specialty hospitals without twenty-four hour emergency
 departments, such notification shall take place through written  materi-
 als  provided  to  patients  during  the intake and registration process
 prior to the provision of any health care services  or  procedures,  and
 through  information  on  bills  and  statements  sent to patients, that
 financial aid may be available to qualified patients and how  to  obtain
 further  information.  Application  materials  shall include a notice to
 patients that upon submission of a completed application, including  any
 information or documentation needed to determine the patient's eligibil-
 ity  pursuant to the hospital's financial assistance policy, the patient
 may disregard any bills until the hospital has rendered  a  decision  on
 the  application  in  accordance  with this paragraph] GENERAL HOSPITALS
 S. 1366--B  5
 
 SHALL POST THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION POLICY AND FORM,
 AND THE SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTION PROCESS, IN A CONSPICUOUS LOCATION AND
 DOWNLOADABLE FORM ON THE GENERAL HOSPITAL'S  WEBSITE.  THE  COMMISSIONER
 SHALL POST THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM AND POLICY IN DOWNLOAD-
 ABLE  FORM  ON  THE  DEPARTMENT'S HOSPITAL PROFILE PAGE OR ANY SUCCESSOR
 WEBSITE.
  [(d) Such polices and procedures] (E) THE COMMISSIONER  SHALL  PROVIDE
 APPLICATION MATERIALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS, INCLUDING THE UNIFORM FINAN-
 CIAL  ASSISTANCE APPLICATION FORM AND POLICY.  THESE APPLICATION MATERI-
 ALS SHALL INCLUDE A  NOTICE  TO  PATIENTS  THAT  UPON  SUBMISSION  OF  A
 COMPLETED  APPLICATION  FORM,  THE  PATIENT  SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 BILLS UNTIL THE GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS RENDERED A DECISION ON THE APPLICA-
 TION IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THIS  SUBDIVISION.  THE  APPLICATION  MATERIALS
 SHALL  INCLUDE  SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS THE INCOME LEVELS USED TO DETER-
 MINE ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND THE  MEANS  TO  APPLY  FOR
 ASSISTANCE. NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS PRECLUDING
 THE USE OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS BY HOSPITALS ON BEHALF
 OF  PATIENTS.  THE  UNIFORM  APPLICATION  FORM  AND POLICY shall include
 clear, objective criteria for determining a patient's ability to pay and
 for providing such adjustments to payment requirements as are necessary.
 In addition to adjustment mechanisms such as sliding fee  schedules  and
 discounts to fixed standards, [such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM
 POLICY  shall  also  provide  for  the  use of installment plans for the
 payment of outstanding balances by patients [pursuant to the  provisions
 of  the  hospital's  financial  assistance  policy]. The monthly payment
 under such a plan shall not exceed  [ten]  FIVE  percent  of  the  gross
 monthly  income  of  the  patient[,  provided,  however, that if patient
 assets are considered under such a policy, then patient assets which are
 not excluded assets pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of  paragraph  (b)  of
 this  subdivision  may be considered in addition to the limit on monthly
 payments]. INSTALLMENT PLAN PAYMENTS MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO BEGIN BEFORE
 ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE DATE  OF  THE  SERVICE  OR  DISCHARGE,
 WHICHEVER  IS LATER. THE POLICY SHALL ALLOW THE PATIENT AND THE HOSPITAL
 TO MUTUALLY AGREE TO MODIFY THE TERMS OF AN INSTALLMENT PLAN.  The  rate
 of  interest charged to the patient on the unpaid balance, if any, shall
 not exceed [the rate for a ninety-day  security  issued  by  the  United
 States  Department of Treasury, plus .5 percent] TWO PERCENTUM PER ANNUM
 and no plan shall include an accelerator or similar clause under which a
 higher rate of interest is triggered upon a missed payment.  [If  such
 policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY SHALL NOT include a require-
 ment  of  a  deposit prior to [non-emergent,] medically-necessary care[,
 such deposit must be included as part of  any  financial  aid  consider-
 ation].  THE  HOSPITAL  SHALL  REFUND ANY PAYMENTS MADE BY THE PATIENT
 BEFORE THE DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  THAT
 EXCEEDS  THE PATIENT'S LIABILITY AFTER DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED. Such poli-
 cies and procedures  shall  be  applied  consistently  to  all  eligible
 patients.
  [(e) Such policies and procedures shall permit patients to] (F) IN ANY
 LEGAL  ACTION  BY  OR ON BEHALF OF A HOSPITAL TO COLLECT A MEDICAL DEBT,
 THE COMPLAINT SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN  AFFIDAVIT  BY  THE  HOSPITAL'S
 CHIEF  FINANCIAL  OFFICER STATING THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN REASONABLE
 STEPS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT QUALIFIES FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSIST-
 ANCE  AND  UPON  INFORMATION  AND  BELIEF  THE PATIENT DOES NOT MEET THE
 INCOME OR RESIDENCY CRITERIA  FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE.  PATIENTS  MAY
 apply  for FINANCIAL assistance [within at least ninety days of the date
 of discharge or date of service and provide at  least  twenty  days  for
 S. 1366--B  6

 patients  to  submit  a  completed  application]  AT ANY TIME DURING THE
 COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF A  MEDICAL  DEBT
 COURT  ACTION  OR  UPON  THE  PLAINTIFF OBTAINING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.  A
 DETERMINATION  THAT A PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SHALL
 BE VALID FOR A MINIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS AND WILL APPLY TO ALL  OUTSTAND-
 ING  MEDICAL  BILLS.  A HOSPITAL MAY USE CREDIT SCORING SOFTWARE FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING  INCOME  ELIGIBILITY  AND  APPROVING  FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE,  BUT  ONLY  IF  THE HOSPITAL MAKES CLEAR TO THE PATIENT THAT
 PROVIDING A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS NOT MANDATORY AND THE SCORING DOES
 NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PATIENT'S CREDIT SCORE.  HOWEVER, CREDIT SCOR-
 ING SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON BY THE HOSPITAL IN  DENYING
 A PATIENT'S APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FURTHER, PROPENSITY TO
 PAY  SCORES MAY NOT DISQUALIFY PATIENTS WHO OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR ELIGI-
 BILITY FROM RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. [Such  policies  and  proce-
 dures may require that] THE UNIFORM POLICY AND FORM SHALL ALLOW patients
 seeking [payment adjustments] FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO provide [appropri-
 ate] THE FOLLOWING financial information and documentation in support of
 their  application[,  provided,  however,  that such application process
 shall not be unduly burdensome or complex]: PAY  CHECKS  OR  PAY  STUBS;
 UNEMPLOYMENT  DOCUMENTATION;  SOCIAL  SECURITY  INCOME; RENT RECEIPTS; A
 LETTER FROM THE PATIENT'S EMPLOYER  ATTESTING  TO  THE  PATIENT'S  GROSS
 INCOME;  DOCUMENTATION  OF ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER MEANS-TESTED GOVERNMENT
 BENEFITS; OR, IF NONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED INFORMATION  AND  DOCUMENTA-
 TION  ARE  AVAILABLE, A WRITTEN SELF-ATTESTATION OF THE PATIENT'S INCOME
 MAY BE USED. General hospitals shall[, upon  request,]  TAKE  REASONABLE
 STEPS  TO assist patients in understanding the [hospital's, policies and
 procedures] UNIFORM POLICY AND FORM, and in applying for payment adjust-
 ments. [Application forms  shall  be  printed]  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 TRANSLATE  THE  UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION FORM AND POLICY
 INTO THE "PRIMARY LANGUAGES" OF  EACH  GENERAL  HOSPITAL.  EACH  GENERAL
 HOSPITAL  SHALL  PRINT  AND  POST  THESE MATERIALS TO ITS WEBSITE in the
 "primary languages" of patients served by the general hospital. For  the
 purposes  of  this  paragraph,  "primary  languages"  shall  include any
 language that is either (i) used to communicate, during  at  least  five
 percent of patient visits in a year, by patients who cannot speak, read,
 write  or  understand  the  English language at the level of proficiency
 necessary for effective communication with  health  care  providers,  or
 (ii)  spoken  by  [non-English]  LIMITED-ENGLISH  speaking  individuals
 comprising more than one percent of the primary  hospital  service  area
 population,  as  calculated using demographic information available from
 the United States Bureau of the Census, supplemented by data from school
 systems. Decisions regarding such  applications  shall  be  made  within
 thirty  days  of  receipt of a completed application. [Such policies and
 procedures] THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY shall  require  that
 the  hospital  issue  any [denial/approval] DENIAL OR APPROVAL of [such]
 THE application in writing WHICH  CLEARLY  COMMUNICATES  THE  AMOUNT  OF
 ASSISTANCE  GRANTED,  ANY  AMOUNTS STILL OWED with information on how to
 appeal the [denial] DECISION and shall require the hospital to establish
 an appeals process under which it will evaluate the [denial of] DECISION
 ABOUT an application. Nothing in this subdivision shall [be  interpreted
 as  prohibiting  a  hospital  from  making the availability of financial
 assistance contingent upon the patient first applying for coverage under
 title XIX of the social security act  (medicaid)  or  another  insurance
 program if, in the judgment of the hospital, the patient may be eligible
 for  medicaid or another insurance program, and upon the patient's coop-
 eration in following the  hospital's  financial  assistance  application
 S. 1366--B  7

 requirements,  including  the  provision of information needed to make a
 determination on the patient's application in accordance with the hospi-
 tal's financial assistance policy] PREVENT A HOSPITAL FROM INFORMING AND
 ASSISTING  A  PATIENT  WITH AN APPLICATION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE
 WITH A LOCAL SERVICES DISTRICT OR THE MARKETPLACE. A HOSPITAL SHALL  NOT
 MAKE  THE  AVAILABILITY  OF  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  CONTINGENT  UPON THE
 PATIENT'S APPLICATION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.  THE HOSPITAL SHALL
 INFORM PATIENTS ON HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST  THE  HOSPITAL  OR  A
 DEBT  COLLECTOR  THAT  IS CONTRACTED ON BEHALF OF THE HOSPITAL REGARDING
 THE PATIENT'S BILL.  GENERAL HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO  TAKE  REASONABLE
 MEASURES  TO DETERMINE IF A PATIENT  IS  ELIGIBLE  FOR FINANCIAL ASSIST-
 ANCE INCLUDING PRIOR TO MAKING A REFERRAL TO A THIRD-PARTY DEBT  COLLEC-
 TOR OR  OTHER EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTIONS MEASURES.
  [(f)  Such  policies and procedures] (G) THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSIST-
 ANCE POLICY shall provide that patients with incomes below  [three]  SIX
 hundred  percent of the federal poverty level are deemed [presumptively]
 eligible for payment adjustments and shall conform to  the  requirements
 set  forth in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, provided, however, that
 nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted as precluding hospitals
 from extending such payment adjustments to other patients, either gener-
 ally or on a case-by-case basis. [Such  policies  and  procedures  shall
 provide  financial  aid for emergency hospital services, including emer-
 gency transfers pursuant to the federal emergency medical treatment  and
 active  labor  act  (42  USC 1395dd), to patients who reside in New York
 state and for medically necessary hospital  services  for  patients  who
 reside in the hospital's primary service area as determined according to
 criteria  established  by the commissioner. In developing such criteria,
 the commissioner shall consult  with  representatives  of  the  hospital
 industry,  health  care consumer advocates and local public health offi-
 cials. Such criteria shall be made available to the public no less  than
 thirty days prior to the date of implementation and shall, at a minimum:
  (i)  prohibit  a  hospital  from  developing  or  altering its primary
 service area in a manner designed to avoid medically underserved  commu-
 nities or communities with high percentages of uninsured residents;
  (ii)  ensure that every geographic area of the state is included in at
 least one general hospital's  primary  service  area  so  that  eligible
 patients may access care and financial assistance; and
  (iii)  require the hospital to notify the commissioner upon making any
 change to its primary service area, and to include a description of  its
 primary  service  area  in  the  hospital's annual implementation report
 filed pursuant to subdivision  three  of  section  twenty-eight  hundred
 three-l of this article.
  [(g)] (H) Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted as preclud-
 ing hospitals from extending payment adjustments for medically necessary
 non-emergency  hospital  services  to patients outside of the hospital's
 primary service area.] For patients determined to be eligible for finan-
 cial [aid] ASSISTANCE under the terms  of  [a  hospital's]  THE  UNIFORM
 financial  [aid]  ASSISTANCE  policy, [such policies and procedures] THE
 UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY shall prohibit  any  limitations  on
 financial  [aid]  ASSISTANCE for services based on the medical condition
 of the applicant, other than typical limitations or exclusions based  on
 medical  necessity or the clinical or therapeutic benefit of a procedure
 or treatment.
  [(h) Such policies and procedures shall not permit the forced]  (I)  A
 HOSPITAL  OR ITS AGENT SHALL NOT COMMENCE A LEGAL ACTION OR FORCE A sale
 or foreclosure of a patient's primary residence in order to  collect  an
 S. 1366--B  8
 
 outstanding medical bill and shall [require the hospital to refrain from
 sending] NOT SEND an account to collection [if the patient has submitted
 a  completed  application  for  financial  aid,  including  any required
 supporting  documentation,  while  the hospital determines the patient's
 eligibility for such aid] UNTIL THE HOSPITAL  HAS  DETERMINED  THAT  THE
 PATIENT  IS  NOT  ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  [Such policies and
 procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY shall provide for  written  notification,
 which  shall  include  notification  on a patient bill, to a patient not
 less than thirty days prior to the referral of debts for collection  and
 shall  require  that the collection agency obtain the hospital's written
 consent prior to commencing a legal action. [Such  policies  and  proce-
 dures]  THE  UNIFORM POLICY shall require all general hospital staff who
 interact  with  patients  or  have  responsibility  for  billing  and
 collections  to be trained in [such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM
 POLICY, and require the implementation of a mechanism  for  the  general
 hospital  to  measure its compliance with [such policies and procedures]
 THE UNIFORM POLICY. [Such policies and procedures]  THE  UNIFORM  POLICY
 shall  require that any collection agency, LAWYER OR FIRM under contract
 with a general hospital for the collection of debts follow  the  [hospi-
 tal's] UNIFORM financial assistance policy, including providing informa-
 tion  to  patients on how to apply for financial assistance where appro-
 priate. [Such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY shall prohibit
 collections from a patient who is determined to be eligible for  medical
 assistance  [pursuant  to  title XIX of the federal social security act]
 UNDER TITLE ELEVEN OF ARTICLE FIVE OF THE SOCIAL  SERVICES  LAW  at  the
 time  services  were rendered and for which services medicaid payment is
 available.
