 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to  provid-
  ing for cage-free egg production
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds the following:
  a.  According  to  the  Pew  Commission  on  Industrial  Farm  Animal
 Production, food animals that are treated  well  and  provided  with  at
 least  minimum  accommodation  of  their  natural behaviors and physical
 needs are healthier and safer for human consumption.
  b. A key finding from the World Health Organization and Food and Agri-
 cultural Organization of the United Nations Salmonella  Risk  Assessment
 was  that  reducing  flock prevalence results in a directly proportional
 reduction in human health risk.
  c. Egg-laying hens subjected to stress are more likely to have  higher
 levels  of pathogens in their intestines and the conditions increase the
 likelihood that consumers will be exposed to higher levels of food-borne
 pathogens.
  d. Salmonella is the most commonly diagnosed food-borne illness in the
 United States.
  e. It is the intent of the legislature to protect consumers  from  the
 deleterious,  health,  safety,  and  welfare  effects  of  the  sale and
 consumption of eggs derived from egg-laying hens  that  are  exposed  to
 significant  stress  and  may  result  in  increased exposure to disease
 pathogens including salmonella.
  § 2. The agriculture and markets  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 160-f to read as follows:
  §  160-F.  CAGE-FREE  EGG  PRODUCTION.  1.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER
