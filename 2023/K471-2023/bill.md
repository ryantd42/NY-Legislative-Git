  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 14-20, 2023, as Food Allergy Awareness  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 14-20, 2023, as Food
Allergy Awareness Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Food Allergy Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Food  allergies  affect  4% of the population and cause an
estimated 50,000 to 125,000 emergency  room  visits  each  year  in  the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thirty-two  million  Americans  have  food  allergies, 5.6
million are children under the age of 18, and research  shows  that  the
prevalence of food allergy is increasing among children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Children with allergies are two to four times as likely to
have other allergic conditions, such as asthma or eczema;  approximately
40%  of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food,
and 40% of children  with  food  allergies  have  experienced  a  severe
allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that
the prevalence of food  allergies  in  children  has  increased  by  50%
between 1997 and 2011; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eight  major food allergens cause most of all food allergy
reactions in the United States: shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree  nuts,
peanuts,  soy,  and  wheat;  symptoms  of  a  food-allergic reaction can
include hives, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, and swelling of
the throat; and
 
  WHEREAS, Reactions typically occur when  an  individual  unknowingly
eats a food containing an ingredient to which they are allergic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  200,000  people  in the United States require
emergency medical care for allergic reactions to food; and
 
  WHEREAS, While most food allergies arise in childhood, at least  15%
of  food  allergies  are  first diagnosed in adulthood; serious or fatal
reactions can happen at any time, however  teenagers  and  young  adults
with  food  allergies  are  at  the  highest  risk of fatal food-induced
anaphylaxis; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is no cure for food allergy, and  scientists  do  not
understand  why;  strict avoidance of the offending food is the only way
 
to prevent an  allergic  reaction;  once  a  serious  allergic  reaction
begins, the only effective treatment is epinephrine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in
onset and may cause death; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of  New  York,  supports the increase in public awareness regarding food
allergies and anaphylaxis; it is  important  to  help  educate  schools,
restaurants and all citizens of the State of New York of the serious and
potentially  life-threatening  nature of food allergies; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 14-20, 2023, as Food
Allergy Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
