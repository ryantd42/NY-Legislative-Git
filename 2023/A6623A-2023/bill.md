 Such  estimate of annual wages to determine eligibility for the purposes
 of this subdivision shall be provided by the employer. For the  purposes
 of  this  subdivision,  a  newly  hired  state  employee whose immediate
 preceding employment was with another department, division, or agency of
 the state shall not be deemed to be an eligible employee.
  (B)  BEGINNING  JANUARY  FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE, THE TERM
 ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES SHALL ALSO MEAN ANY PERSON  WHO  WOULD  OTHERWISE  BE
 ENTITLED  TO  RECEIVE A BENEFIT UNDER THE RETIREMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY
 LAW OR THE EDUCATION LAW INITIALLY HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST,  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN
 THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  OR  THE  NEW
 YORK  STATE  TEACHERS'  RETIREMENT SYSTEM. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PARA-
 GRAPH, A NEWLY HIRED STATE EMPLOYEE WHOSE PRIOR EMPLOYMENT,  IMMEDIATELY
 PRECEDING  SUCH STATE EMPLOYMENT, WAS WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT, DIVISION,
 OR AGENCY OF THE STATE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE AN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE.
  § 3. Section 209 of the civil service law is amended by adding  a  new
 subdivision 7 to read as follows:
  7.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, FOR
 ANY DISPUTE THAT IS SUBJECT TO  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE
 DETERMINATION  OF  THE  PUBLIC ARBITRATION PANEL ON A DISPUTED AGREEMENT
 SHALL NOT CONTAIN AN INCREASE IN ALL COMPENSATION ITEMS SUBJECT TO NEGO-
 TIATION WHICH IS GREATER THAN TWO PERCENT  MORE  THAN  ALL  COMPENSATION
 ITEMS  SUBJECT  TO  NEGOTIATION RECEIVED BY THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION IN
 THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE  ORGANIZATION
 IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE AGREEMENT BEING ARBITRATED.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would amend Section 390 of the Education Law to broaden the
 definition of the term "eligible employees" as it applies to eligibility
 to join the State University of New  York  Optional  Retirement  Program
 (ORP),  otherwise  known  as  the Voluntary Defined Contribution Program
 (VDC). The definition would be expanded to include any person  initially
 hired  on  or  after January 1, 2023 who would otherwise be eligible for
 membership in the New York State Teachers' Retirement System (NYSTRS) or
 the New York State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS). Currently  only
 new  employees  with an annual salary of $75,000 or more and who are not
 represented by a collective bargaining unit must choose between  joining
 the  public  retirement  system (NYSTRS, NYSLRS) or the ORP/VDC. A newly
 hired state employee whose prior employment, immediately preceding  such
 state  employment,  was  with another department, division, or agency of
 the state shall not be deemed to be an eligible employee.
  It is not possible to determine the total annual cost to the employers
 of members of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System  since  the
 number  of  newly hired employees who would choose to participate in the
 ORP/VDC each year cannot be estimated. This bill represents a  fundamen-
 tal  change  in  the  structure  of public retirement benefits and would
 substantially impact their funding. The number of new  entrants  to  the
 System could potentially decline each year if some newly hired employees
 opt  to  participate  in the ORP/VDC. The System's outstanding liability
 under the defined benefit plan is funded over the average future remain-
 ing working lifetime of its members. Thus, if the System  experiences  a
 large  decline  in  the  number  of new entrants each year, this funding
 period would decrease, resulting  in  potentially  increasing  costs  to
 employers. It is strongly recommended that a full actuarial analysis and
 report  be  completed  to gauge all the potential costs and implications

 fully and more quantitatively before a structural change of this  magni-
 tude is undertaken.
  Member  data  is  from  the  System's  most recent actuarial valuation
 files, consisting of data provided by the employers  to  the  Retirement
 System.  Data  distributions and statistics can be found in the System's
 Annual Report. System assets are as reported in the  System's  financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuar-
 ial assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.

 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2023
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A.  Young, am the Chief Actuary for  the
