 AN ACT establishing the New York state commission to end mass incarcera-
  tion and to prevent violence
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The United States has the largest pris-
 on  population in the world as well as the highest per-capita incarcera-
 tion rate. In the United States, the  crime  rate  is  not  much  higher
 compared  to  that in Western Europe. However, the incarceration rate is
 three or four times higher even though the crime rate is lower  than  at
 any  time  since  the  mid-1960s, and the United States has incarcerated
 seven times as many people since that time while making  up  about  five
 percent  of the world's population, and has nearly twenty-one percent of
 the world's prisoners. African Americans are incarcerated at  more  than
 five  times  the rate of whites. The imprisonment rate of African Ameri-
 cans for drug charges is almost six times  that  of  whites  even  while
 African  Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, and if African
 Americans and Hispanics were incarcerated at the same rates  as  whites,
 prison and jail populations would be reduced by almost forty percent. It
 shall  be  the policy of the state of New York to end mass incarceration
 and to deter violent crime for the purpose of justice and public safety.
  § 2. A temporary state commission, to be known as the New  York  state
 commission  to end mass incarceration and to prevent violence, is hereby
 created to investigate, evaluate and make recommendations concerning how
 to reduce the New York prison population and the incidences  of  violent
 crime in New York state.
  §  3.  (a)  The  commission  shall consist of seventeen members, to be
 appointed as follows: nine members to be appointed by the governor,  one
 of  whom shall be the chair; three members to be appointed by the tempo-
 rary president of the senate; one member appointed by the senate minori-

 ty leader; three members appointed by the speaker of the  assembly;  and
 one member appointed by the assembly minority leader.
  (b)  The  members  of the commission shall receive no compensation for
 their services, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses
 incurred in the performance of their duties under this act. The  commis-
 sion  may  employ  and  at pleasure remove such personnel as it may deem
 necessary for the performance of its functions  and  fix  their  compen-
 sation within the amounts made available by appropriation therefor.
  § 4. Specifically the commission shall investigate:
  (a) how to reduce the New York prison population based on fairness and
 justice by exploring various topics, including, but not limited to:
  (1) operations of the criminal justice system;
  (2) the impact of the war on drugs;
  (3)  racial  inequities  throughout  the  state  of  New York criminal
 justice system;
  (4) the impact of economic and social inequalities;
  (5) reduced mandatory sentences and sentencing reform generally;
  (6) more sentencing flexibility for judges;
  (7) reducing  the  post-release  impact  of  imprisonment  by  banning

 to employment, education, housing,  social  services  and  other  public
 benefits;
  (8) drug and alcohol addictions, and mental illness treatment in pris-
 on;
  (9) drug and alcohol addictions, and mental illness treatment alterna-
 tives to prison;
  (10) the impact of privately-owned prisons;
  (11)  humane treatment of prisoners and safe and healthy prison condi-
 tions;
  (12) spread of HIV and AIDS in prisons;
  (13) policies that have increased costs to prisoners such  as  use  of
 phones  or  purchasing supplies, which discriminate against lower income
 inmates; and
  (14) bail reform; and
  (b) how to reduce the incidences of violent crime in New York state by
 examining various topics, including, but not limited to:
  (1) providing body cams for police;
  (2) supporting community policing;
  (3) improving police training;
  (4) increasing educational and  job  training  opportunities  for  the
 at-risk population;
  (5) reducing high school dropout rates;
  (6) additional employment opportunities;
  (7) social work-related support systems;
  (8) preventative violent crime measures;
  (9) increasing individual and community awareness programs;
  (10)  stricter  gun  laws  aimed  at  keeping guns from criminals, the
 mentally impaired,  and  children,  and  to  prevent  accidents  through
 enhanced training and regulations;
  (11) increasing use of data and information technology;
  (12) additional investments in police, schools, and re-entry programs;
  (13) the relationship between drugs and alcohol with violent crime;
