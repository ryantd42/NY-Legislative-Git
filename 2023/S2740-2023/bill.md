 Introduced  by  Sen.  COMRIE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the state finance law, in relation to  the  purchase  of
  green cleaning and other custodial products
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This law shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "greening our cleaning act".
  §  2.  Statement  of  findings and purpose. The legislature finds that
 there are environmentally preferable alternatives to the  products  that
 we  commonly  use  for  routine  tasks, such as cleaning and maintaining
 interior building finishes. Such alternatives  are  most  beneficial  to
 those  who apply them and those who occupy buildings where such products
 are used. In addition to the federal government, a number of  state  and
 local jurisdictions have taken steps to purchase environmentally prefer-
 able or "green" cleaning products.
  The  legislature finds that the purchase and use of many such environ-
 mentally preferable cleaning alternatives will result in improved indoor
 air quality and enhanced environmental health.
  § 3. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section  169  to
 read as follows:
