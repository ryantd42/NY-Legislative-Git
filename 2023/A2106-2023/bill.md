 PAYMENT DATE FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD OR DELIVERED TO  THEM  DURING  A
 CREDIT  PERIOD  ENDING ON THEIR FINAL PAYMENT DATE. NO RETAILER SHALL BE

 EQUAL  TO  OR  GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE DEFAULT. ANY SUCH RETAILER
 RECEIVING SUCH NOTICE SHALL NOT THEREAFTER  PURCHASE  CANNABIS  PRODUCTS

 DELINQUENT  RETAILERS AND EXTEND FOR THREE DAYS THE DATE FOR FILING WITH
 THE BOARD THE COPIES OF NOTICES SENT TO SUCH RETAILERS AND/OR THE  WRIT-

 BOARD, IN ITS DISCRETION, MAY LIMIT THE DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED  TO  THOSE
 RELATING  TO  RETAILERS  WHO ARE TO BE ADDED OR DELETED FROM THE DEFAULT
 LIST AND DIRECT THAT THE DISTRIBUTOR SHALL MAINTAIN COPIES OF ALL  OTHER
 DOCUMENTS  REQUIRED  UNDER  THIS  SECTION  FOR  FUTURE INSPECTION BY THE
 BOARD. THE BOARD SHALL, AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER  EACH  NOTIFICATION
 DATE,  COMPILE  AND  PUBLISH  AND FURNISH EACH DISTRIBUTOR A LIST, TO BE
 DESIGNATED THE DELINQUENT LIST, CONTAINING THE NAMES  AND  ADDRESSES  OF

 WITH THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION MAY, AT THE DISCRETION  OF
 THE BOARD, SUBJECT THE LICENSE OF SUCH DISTRIBUTOR TO SUSPENSION FOR NOT
 MORE THAN FIVE DAYS FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE, AND NOT MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS
 FOR  A  SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE. THE BOARD MAY PUBLISH THE DELINQUENT LIST ON
 ITS WEBSITE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FULL ACCESS SHALL BE RESTRICTED  TO
 THOSE DISTRIBUTORS AND ACCESS TO THEIR SPECIFIC STATUS SHALL BE PROVIDED
 TO  RETAILERS.  SUCH  PUBLICATION SHALL BE CONSIDERED RECEIPT THEREOF BY
 ALL DISTRIBUTORS.
  4. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY DISPUTE SHALL EXIST BETWEEN  ANY  DISTRIBUTOR
 AND  A  RETAILER  TO  WHOM  HE OR SHE SHALL HAVE SOLD CANNABIS PRODUCTS,
 EITHER AS TO THE FACT OF PAYMENT OR AS TO THE AMOUNT DUE FOR SUCH CANNA-
 BIS PRODUCTS OR AS TO THE QUANTITY OF  THE  CANNABIS  PRODUCTS  SOLD  OR
 DELIVERED,  WHICH  DISPUTE CANNOT BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN THEM, THE BOARD IS
 HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE STATEMENTS FROM EACH OF THE PARTIES TO SUCH
 DISPUTE AS TO THE FACTS  AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  THEREOF  AND  TO  DETERMINE
 WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RETAILER'S NAME SHOULD BE PUBLISHED ON THE APPROPRI-
 ATE DELINQUENT LIST.
  5.  THE  BOARD IN THE CASE OF A RETAILER WHO HAS ACTUALLY MADE PAYMENT
 FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS, OR ON GOOD CAUSE SHOWN TO IT, MAY PERMIT SALES OR
 DELIVERIES TO ANY RETAILER WHO HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF DEFAULT OR WHO  IS
 NAMED  ON  ANY DELINQUENT LIST, ON TERMS OTHER THAN FOR CASH, BUT WITHIN
 THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION, PRIOR TO THE PUBLICATION  OF  THE  NEXT
 APPROPRIATE DELINQUENT LIST.

 SUCH  RETAILER TO PAY ANY AMOUNT IN DEFAULT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE
 PERIOD OF SUSPENSION SHALL BE DEEMED  AND  PUNISHABLE  AS  A  SUBSEQUENT
 OFFENSE  UNTIL PAID. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD MAY REQUIRE ANY SUCH RETAIL-
 ER, AFTER DEFAULT IN MAKING PAYMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS SECTION TO MAKE PAYMENT IN CASH FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS  SUBSEQUENTLY

 THE  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, SHALL LIQUIDATE AND PAY SUCH UNPAID
 BALANCES TO SUCH DISTRIBUTORS IN EQUAL MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS OVER A PERI-
 OD OF THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE UPON WHICH SUCH UNPAID BALANCES  BECOME
 DUE.  THE BOARD, SHALL NOT, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF SUCH AN INDEBTEDNESS OR
 FAILURE TO PAY SUCH BALANCE REFUSE TO RENEW  THE  LICENSE  OF  ANY  SUCH
 LICENSEE.
  8. NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE ANY DISTRIB-
 UTOR  TO  EXTEND  CREDIT TO ANY RETAILER NOR TO RESTRAIN ANY DISTRIBUTOR
 FROM SEEKING TO ENFORCE BY LEGAL ACTION OR OTHERWISE, PAYMENT OF ANY SUM

 OR SUMS OF MONEY DUE OR ALLEGED TO BE DUE TO ANY  SUCH  DISTRIBUTOR  FOR
 CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD OR DELIVERED TO ANY SUCH RETAILER.
  9.  THE  BOARD  IS  HEREBY  AUTHORIZED TO DO SUCH ACTS, PRESCRIBE SUCH
 FORMS AND MAKE SUCH RULES, REGULATIONS AND ORDERS AS IT MAY DEEM  NECES-
 SARY  OR  PROPER  FULLY  TO  EFFECTUATE  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE CHANGING OF ANY DATE ON WHICH  ANY  ACT
 OR  FUNCTION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION IS TO BE PERFORMED BY ANY LICENSEE

 A  LIKE SUM SHALL BE PAID BY EACH PERSON HEREAFTER APPLYING FOR ANY SUCH
 LICENSE OR THE RENEWAL OF ANY SUCH LICENSE, AND SUCH SUM SHALL ACCOMPANY

 LICENSE OR RENEWAL, AS THE CASE MAY BE.

 ly, the addition, amendment and/or repeal  of  any  rule  or  regulation
