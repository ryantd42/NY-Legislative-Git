 in the past to fill such titles in the competitive class. The department
 shall prepare a report on its findings that shall also include recommen-
 dations to  the  legislature  on  increasing  the  number  of  permanent
 appointments  in  such  titles and on ensuring that the necessary quali-
 fications for such titles are adequately assessed in  competitive  exam-
 inations.

 report provided for in section one of this  act  to  the  governor,  the
