  1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  every
 public  authority  and  every  public  benefit corporation created by or
 pursuant to [New York] state law at least three  of  whose  members  are
 appointed  by  the  governor,  whether  such authority or corporation is
 otherwise governed by this chapter (such entities, as so constituted, to
 be hereafter in  this  title  referred  to  as  "public  benefit  corpo-
 rations"), shall reimburse to [New York] THE state an allocable share of
 state  governmental  costs  attributable to the provision of services to
 public benefit corporations,  as  determined  [herein]  IN  THIS  TITLE.
