  COMMENDING  Delta  Sigma  Theta  Sorority  Inc.
  Brooklyn  Alumnae  Chapter,  upon  the  occasion  of
  hosting its Jabberwock event on June 11, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to commend those
illustrious organizations within the State of New York whose  focus  and
intent  have  made  a substantial impact on the quality of life in their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Brooklyn Alumnae  Chapter,  upon
the  occasion  of hosting its Jabberwock event on Sunday, June 11, 2023,
at Dyker Beach Golf Course, Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is a  private,  non-profit
organization  whose purpose is to provide assistance and support through
established programs in local communities throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Brooklyn Alumnae Chapter has  proudly  served  Brooklyn
communities  since  1949  through  the  organization's  Five  Point
Programmatic  Thrust:  economic  development,  educational  development,
international awareness and involvement, physical and mental health, and
political awareness and involvement; and
 
  WHEREAS, The name "Jabberwock" is a title taken from the short story
"Through  the Looking Glass" by Lewis Carroll; "Jabberwock" is a poem of
clever nonsense that could only be read when held up to a looking glass;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The atmosphere of the Jabberwock Cotillion was  created  so
each  participant  would  be  able  to  hold her dreams, both clever and
fantastic, up to the looking glass and make sense of  the  "Jabberwock";
the  young  ladies  of  the  Jabberwock  Cotillion  have the courage and
determination to step through their mirrors, find truths in the illusion
and confront, create and change their individual and collective futures;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jabberwock Cotillion  is  a  comprehensive  scholarship
program  designed  to  enhance leadership, character, self-awareness and
social awareness through a series  of  rich  interactive  workshops  and
cultural  activities; the elegant culminating activity is the cotillion,
where the young ladies are awarded scholarships,  presented  to  society
and Miss Jabberwock is crowned; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Brooklyn
Alumnae  Chapter is in direct correlation to the efforts of its members,
whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of  the  sorority  and
the population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  light  of  its  commitment, dedication, and successful
efforts, it is the practice of  this  Legislative  Body  to  extend  its
highest  commendation  to  the  Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Brooklyn
Alumnae Chapter; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Brooklyn Alumnae  Chapter,  upon
the occasion of hosting its Jabberwock event on June 11, 2023; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Brooklyn Alumnae Chapter.
