 AN  ACT  relating  to  the  Long  Island  Rail Road weekend reduced fare
  program

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The New York state legislature has
 found that on the weekends the Long Island Rail Road,  a  subsidiary  of
 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, provides reduced fare between
 the  hours of 12:01 AM Saturday until 11:59 AM Sunday at certain station
 locations. Passengers traveling to and from locations  within  New  York
 city  should  not  forfeit  their enjoyment of such reduced fare because
 their train happens to pass through Nassau county.
  § 2. Definitions. The term "fare" shall mean a person or  persons  who
 tender  money  to participate in the transportation services provided by
 the Long Island Rail Road.
  § 3. It shall be unlawful for the Long Island  Rail  Road  to  exclude
 from  its  weekend reduced fare programs individuals traveling from East
 New York station to another location within New York city  and  to  East
 New York station from another location within New York city.
  §  4.  All  trips  included in such weekend reduced fare program shall
 receive the same reduced fare regardless of starting and ending points.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing the date upon which it shall have become a law.
