  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim

  WHEREAS,  School  counselors  and  school  counseling programs are a
vital and integral part of the educational process; and
 
  WHEREAS, School counselors provide a  broad  array  of  services  in
public and private schools throughout the State and Nation which benefit
students, parents, faculty, administrators and the community alike; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  counselors  provide  counseling,  information,
developmental guidance, and educational and career planning; and
 
  WHEREAS, School counselors are actively involved in helping students
explore their abilities, strengths, interests and talents; and
 
  WHEREAS, School counselors help parents focus on ways to further the
educational, personal, and social growth of their children; and
 
  WHEREAS, School counselors work with teachers and other educators to
help students explore  their  potential  and  set  realistic  goals  for
themselves,  on dropout prevention, and on conflict resolution programs;
and
 
  WHEREAS, School counselors help students develop  or  improve  their
study habits and decision-making and leadership skills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  counselors  identify  and  work  with  community
resources  which  can  enhance  and  complement  comprehensive  school

conflict  and,  sometimes, make themselves available just to listen; the
value of their ongoing contributions following local and national tragic
events exemplifies the important role they play in today's schools; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York's School Counseling Week, held in conjunction with
the observance of National School  Counseling  Week,  sponsored  by  the

lives of our children, and to recognize and commend the  dedication  and
unique  contribution  of professional school counselors; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim February 6-10, 2023, as
School Counseling Week in the State of New York; and be it further

York; and the New York State School Counselor Association.
