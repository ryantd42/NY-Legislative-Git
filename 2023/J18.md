  HONORING Jason's Vineyard upon the occasion of its
  designation  as a Gold Medalist by the New York Wine
  and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Jason's Vineyard upon the occasion of its designation as a Gold Medalist
by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation at its 36th  Annual  New  York
Wine Classic on Tuesday, July 12, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  36th  Annual  New  York  Wine Classic is a nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years  and
allowing  wine  enthusiasts  to  enjoy  this unique part of the New York
experience across the  state,  this  extraordinary  vineyard  has  truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jason's  Vineyard  was  awarded  for  its  2019  Cabernet
Sauvignon and its 2019 Merlot; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jason's Vineyard was planted in 1996 using only the  finest
clones of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc
and  Petit  Verdot;  furthermore,  the  vineyard  purchased  the  grape
varietals of Sauvignon Blanc, Seyvel Blanc, Cayuga and Riesling; and
 
  WHEREAS, The owner of Jason's Vineyard pioneered the  dense  spacing
of  vines  on  the North Fork; this technique, not seen prior to Jason's
Vineyard, is more closely planted than many other local  vineyards;  the
six feet between rows and three feet between adjacent vines are Bordeaux
measurements;  the  design  is  intended  to  reduce  grape  yields  and
intensify wine flavors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Jason's Vineyard is in direct correlation to
the efforts of its dedicated owners and staff, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors  on  behalf  of the businesses and the communities they serve;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community,  fully confident it will continue to enjoy the
 
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Jason's Vineyard upon the occasion of its designation  as  a  Gold
Medalist by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jason's Vineyard.
