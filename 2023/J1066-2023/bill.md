  COMMEMORATING  the  10th Anniversary of the People
  and Animals Living Safely program
 
  WHEREAS, The People and Animals Living  Safely  (PALS)  program  was
founded  in  2013  by the Urban Resource Institute (URI) to provide safe
and secure spaces for survivors of domestic  violence,  their  families,
and pets to stay together and heal together in shelter; and
 
  WHEREAS, PALS was the first and remains the only program in New York
City that offers co-living for people and pets in shelter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  PALS  has  expanded  from one pilot program accepting only
cats to 10 shelters with 304 apartment-style units across New York  City
that can accommodate hundreds of individuals every night along with pets
of any species; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2023, URI's PALS program served its 500th pet; and
 
  WHEREAS,  50%  of  survivors of domestic violence reported that they
could not consider shelter if that would mean leaving their pet  behind;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  presence  of  pets  is  an  important  factor  in the
experience and decision-making of domestic violence survivors,  and  the
human-animal bond is an important part of healing from trauma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  PALS  program  has provided comprehensive services to
address the complex needs  of  domestic  violence  survivors  and  their
diverse  pets,  and  has expanded its scale and scope of services over a
decade of learning; and
 
  WHEREAS, PALS offers technical assistance to other service providers
seeking to accommodate pets and expand access to  pet-friendly  domestic
violence shelter and services; and
 
  WHEREAS, PALS is a proof point of URI's commitment to innovation and
impact in delivering trauma-informed, client-centered services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  PALS  program is celebrating its 10-year anniversary;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the People and Animals Living Safely
(PALS) program; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body  recognize  the  pioneering
efforts of PALS in providing safe and secure  spaces  for  Survivors  of
Domestic  Violence,  their  families, and pets to stay together and heal
together in shelter, and commend its leadership  in  making  sustainable
decisions  that  help  to  positively  address  climate  change, respect
natural resources, and create healthy indoor and  outdoor  environments;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body acknowledge the importance of
pet-friendly domestic violence shelter and services, and  encourage  the
expansion  of pet-friendly services to accommodate the needs of domestic
violence survivors and their pets; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Urban Resource Center's People and Animals Living  Safely
(PALS) program.
