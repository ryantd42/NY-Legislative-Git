 AN ACT to amend the  penal  law  and  the  criminal  procedure  law,  in
  relation  to mandatory imprisonment and plea restrictions for offenses
  victimizing the elderly and physically disabled

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. It is hereby found and declared that elderly and physically
 disabled  people  continue  to be singled out as victims of crime. It is
 also found that the physical  harm  and  emotional  trauma  suffered  by
 elderly  and  physically disabled crime victims has a devastating effect
 on the lives of those victims.
  The elderly or physically disabled victim  has  a  decreased  physical
 capability  to resist an attacker and thus becomes an inviting target of
 crime. Moreover, the aftereffects of crime on the elderly and the  phys-
 ically  handicapped  affect  them  more deeply than any statistics would
 indicate. The emotional trauma  and  possible  serious  physical  damage
 resulting from a face to face crime may cause a permanent downgrading in
 the  elderly  or  physically  disabled  victim's lifestyle. Such victims
 often impose "house-arrest" on themselves,  afraid  to  shop,  to  visit
 friends,  to go to the doctor, to live, unless behind locked doors. Even
 those elderly or physically disabled who are not direct victims of crime
 suffer indirectly, because they, having learned of the terrible  tragedy
 suffered  by other elderly and physically disabled and fearful for their
 own individual safety, barricade  themselves  within  their  homes.  The
 older  or  physically disabled crime victim is thus twice victimized--by
 the crime and by its aftermath.
  Criminologists, sociologists, psychologists, and the police all recog-
 nize and acknowledge these facts, but the law does not.  It  has  been
 ineffective  in  deterring crimes against the elderly and the physically
 disabled,  particularly  those  involving  violence  or  the  threat  of

 violence.  Similarly,  special projects on crime prevention and improved
 techniques of communications for the elderly to the police do  not  halt
 or  reduce such crime. For these reasons, offenses committed against the
 elderly or the physically disabled must be treated as unique, and legis-
 lation  must  be  enacted  to  provide  a meaningful deterrent for those
 offenders who now victimize the elderly and the physically disabled.
  § 2. Subdivision 18 of section 10.00 of the penal law, as  amended  by
 chapter 7 of the laws of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
