  HONORING  the late Stack Bundles upon the occasion
  of re-naming a street in Far  Rockaway,  Queens,  in
  his  name,  in  recognition of his legendary musical
  career and remarkable life on June 10, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
just  tribute  to  those  musical geniuses whose commitment and creative
talents contributed to the  entertainment  and  cultural  enrichment  of
their community, the State of New York, and the entire Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
longstanding traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to  honor
the  late  Stack Bundles upon the occasion of re-naming the intersection
of Beach Channel Drive and Hassock Street in Far Rockaway, Queens, as  a
fitting  and lasting tribute to both his renowned musical career and his
legacy of greatness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rayquon Elliott, also known as "Stack Bundles", was born on
October 21, 1982, in Far Rockaway, Queens; and
 
  WHEREAS, While growing up, Stack Bundles  demonstrated  a  love  for
dancing,  rapping,  and  rollerblading;  his talents were finally put on
display to the world when he was placed in the  music  video  for  Busta
Rhyme's  song  "Put  Your  Hands  Where  My  Eyes Can See" and 702's "No
Doubt"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Around the age of 18,  Stack  Bundles  started  to  immerse
himself in the rapping scene and began freestyling; his perseverance and
determination  to  achieve  getting  his  voice heard led to him waiting
outside the Hot97 radio station for Funkmaster Flex and eventually being
introduced to rappers like Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West; and
 
  WHEREAS, After connecting with big name artists and moving  back  to
Far  Rockaway,  Stack  Bundles and his friends formed a rap group called
S5; this group was  composed  of  Cau2Gs,  Stack  Bundles,  Mike  Millz,
Bishop, and Bynoe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  S5  gained attention from listeners and DJ Clue from their
early recordings of freestyles over  "Welcome  to  New  York  City"  and
"Grindin"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  group  evolving  into  Riot Squad, with Cau2Gs, Stack
Bundles, Chinx Drugz, and Bynoe, the attention from DJ Clue  gave  Stack
Bundles and the Riot Squad the opportunity to create music for DJ Clue's
mixtapes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stack Bundles stood out from the rest in the mixtapes as he
was  known  for  his  raw  and authentic lyrics that resonated with many
people; he had clever wordplay and punchlines that are still relevant in
society today; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the mixtape made artists like Jim Jones  and
Lil  Wayne  gravitate  towards  the  Riot Squad and Stack Bundles; Stack
 
Bundles was featured on  Jim  Jones'  song  "Weatherman"  alongside  Lil
Wayne; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the  song collaboration became a massive hit, Stack
Bundles went on tour with Jim Jones and Lil Wayne  in  2007,  propelling
him to a more mainstream level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  a  tragic event, Stack Bundles was sadly killed at the
age of 24 on June 11, 2007; at his young age, his mark on  the  Hip  Hop
community has never been forgotten; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  his  music  transcending time, Stack Bundles made an
impact on the world that can still be seen today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stack Bundles' dedication to his music leaves an  indelible
legacy  of  inspiration  which  will long endure the passage of time and
will remain as a comforting memory to his family, friends and  countless
fans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the late Stack Bundles upon the occasion of re-naming a street  in
Far Rockaway, Queens, in his name, on June 10, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Rayquon "Stack Bundles" Elliott.
