 If a recipient fails to comply fully with such conditions, the president
 shall  be entitled to receive from such recipient an amount to be deter-
 mined by the formula:
  A = 2B (t-s)
  -----
  t
 in which "A" is the amount the president is entitled to recover; "B"  is
 the  sum  of all payments made to the recipient and the interest on such
 amount which would be payable if at the times such awards were paid they
 were loans bearing interest at the maximum prevailing rate; "t"  is  the
 total  number of months in the recipient's period of obligated services;
 and "s" is the number of months of  service  actually  rendered  by  the
 recipient.  Any  amount which the president is entitled to recover under
 this paragraph shall be paid within the five-year  period  beginning  on
 the  date  that  the recipient failed to comply with this service condi-
 tion. Nothing in the written agreement shall affect the terms of employ-
 ment of the individual who shall negotiate, separate and apart from  the
 program, his or her salary and other forms of employment with an agency,
 institution or a program in which he or she shall be employed.
  Any  obligation  to  comply  with  such provisions as outlined in this
 section shall be cancelled upon the death of the recipient. The  commis-
 sioner shall make regulations to provide for the waiver or suspension of
 any financial obligation which would involve extreme hardship.
  e. Reporting. A recipient of an award shall report annually to the New
 York  state higher education services corporation, and the department of
 health on forms prescribed by the president, as to  the  performance  of
 the  required  services,  commencing with the calendar year in which the
 recipient begins to practice medicine, DENTISTRY OR PODIATRY in a short-
 age area and continuing until the recipient shall have completed, or  it
 is  determined  that  he  or she shall not be obligated to complete, the
 required services.  If the recipient shall  fail  to  file  any  report
 required  hereunder  within thirty days of written notice to the recipi-
 ent, mailed to the address shown on the last application for an award or
 last report filed, whichever is later, the president of the  corporation
 may  impose  a  fine  of up to one thousand dollars. The president shall
 have the discretion to waive the filing of a report, excuse a  delay  in
 filing  or  a  failure  to  file  a  report, or waive or reduce any fine
 imposed for good cause shown.
  f. Other awards. Award recipients shall be eligible to apply  for  one
 additional award.

 awarded annually to students who are beginning or engaged in an approved
 program in medicine [or], dentistry, OR PODIATRY  and  who  are  econom-
 ically  disadvantaged  and/or  members  of  an underrepresented minority
 group, provided, however, that to the extent that  regents  health  care
 professional opportunity scholarships are not awarded, such scholarships
 shall be awarded as regents professional opportunity scholarships. These
 scholarships  shall  be  classified  and  allocated  in  accordance with
 regents rules.
 A. 3509  4
 
  a. In selecting  and  certifying  scholarship  recipients  under  this
 subdivision,  priority  shall be accorded to applicants in the following
 order:
  (1)  First,  to  any  applicant  who  is economically disadvantaged as

 the  profession as determined by the regents after consultation with the
 council on professional  career  opportunity  created  by  section  nine
 hundred forty-one of the executive law;
  (2) Second, to any applicant who is a minority underrepresented in the
 profession  as  determined  by  the  regents after consultation with the

 hundred forty-one of the executive law;
  (3)  Third,  to any applicant who is a graduate of the state-sponsored
 opportunity program pursuant to section sixty-four hundred fifty-one  or

 form of random selection.
  b.  The  commissioner  shall then forward approved applications to the
 president and shall notify unsuccessful applicants.
  c. The president shall notify applicants of their award entitlement.
  d. The president shall, in consultation with the commissioner, develop
 and secure from each successful applicant a written agreement  to  prac-
 tice  medicine [or], dentistry, OR PODIATRY, as appropriate, in a desig-

 lation provide, a recipient of an award shall  have  practiced  medicine
 [or],  dentistry, OR PODIATRY in an area designated as having a shortage
 of physicians [or], dentists, OR PODIATRISTS, as appropriate,  for  that
 number of months calculated by multiplying by twelve the number of annu-
 al payments received by the recipient. In no case shall the total number
 of  months  of service required be less than twenty-four. If a recipient
 fails to comply fully with such conditions, the president shall be enti-
 tled to receive from such recipient an amount to be  determined  by  the
 formula:
  A = 2B (t-s)
  -----
  t
 in  which "A" is the amount the president is entitled to recover; "B" is
 the sum of all payments made to the recipient and the interest  on  such
 amount which would be payable if at the times such awards were paid they
 were  loans  bearing interest at the maximum prevailing rate; "t" is the
 total number of months in the recipient's period of obligated  services;
 and  "s"  is  the  number  of months of service actually rendered by the
 recipient. Any amount which the president is entitled to  recover  under
 this  paragraph  shall  be paid within the five-year period beginning on
 the date that the recipient failed to comply with  this  service  condi-
 tion. Nothing in the written agreement shall affect the terms of employ-
 ment  of the individual who shall negotiate, separate and apart from the
 program, his or her salary and other forms of employment with an agency,
 institution or a program in which he or she shall be employed.
  Any obligation to comply with such  provisions  as  outlined  in  this
 section  shall be cancelled upon the death of the recipient. The commis-
 sioner shall make regulations to provide for the waiver or suspension of
 any financial obligation which would involve extreme hardship.

 gated  to  complete, the required services.  If the recipient shall fail

 cation for an award or last report filed, whichever is later, the presi-
 dent of the corporation may impose a fine of up to one thousand dollars.

 dollars whichever is less.  The  president  shall  be  responsible  for
 calculating  the  dollar  amount of each award that [eligibile] ELIGIBLE
