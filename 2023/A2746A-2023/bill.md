 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to including correctional
  facilities as publicly-assisted housing accommodations for purposes of
  the division of human rights

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative intent and findings. Whereas  recent  judicial
 opinions  have  created  confusion  regarding the status of correctional
 facilities and law enforcement agencies as subjects of the  jurisdiction
 of  the  New  York  human  rights  law, the legislature hereby finds and
 declares, for the purposes of the human rights law and the  division  of
 human  rights,  the  services  provided  by law enforcement officers are
 public accommodations,  correctional  facilities  are  housing  accommo-
 dations,  and  law  enforcement agencies and correctional facilities are
 subject to the jurisdiction of the human rights law.
  § 2. Subdivision 10 of section 292 of the executive law, as  added  by
 chapter 340 of the laws of 1955, is amended to read as follows:
  10. The term "housing accommodation" includes any building, structure,
 or portion thereof which is used or occupied or is intended, arranged or
 designed  to  be  used  or  occupied, as the home, residence or sleeping
 place of one or more human beings, INCLUDING ANY  TYPE  OF  CORRECTIONAL
 FACILITY.
  §  3.  Section  292  of  the  executive law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 42 to read as follows:
  42. THE TERM "CORRECTIONAL FACILITY" SHALL HAVE THE  SAME  MEANING  AS
 SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION TWO OF THE CORRECTION LAW.
  §  4.  Paragraph  (a) of subdivision 2 of section 296 of the executive
 law, as separately amended by chapters 202 and 748 of the laws of  2022,
 is amended to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  (a)  It  shall  be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person,
 being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent  or

 color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orien-
 tation, gender identity or expression, military status, sex, disability,
 marital  status,  or  status  as  a  victim of domestic violence, of any
 person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such
 person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities  or  privileges
 thereof,  including the extension of credit, or, directly or indirectly,
 to publish, circulate, issue, display,  post  or  mail  any  written  or
 printed  communication,  notice or advertisement, to the effect that any
 of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any such
 place shall be refused, withheld from or denied to any person on account
 of race, creed,  color,  national  origin,  citizenship  or  immigration
 status,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or expression, military
 status, sex, disability or marital status,  or  that  the  patronage  or
 custom  thereat  of  any person of or purporting to be of any particular
 race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration  status,
 sexual  orientation, gender identity or expression, military status, sex
 or marital status, or having a disability is unwelcome, objectionable or
 not acceptable, desired or solicited.
