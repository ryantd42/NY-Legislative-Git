 AN ACT to amend the  social  services  law,  in  relation  to  mandatory

  § 473-M. LEGISLATIVE  FINDINGS  AND  PURPOSE.  THE  LEGISLATURE HEREBY
 FINDS THAT THE PROBLEM OF ABUSE OF MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY  INCAPACITATED

 CATE THE ABUSE TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES OR THE  VICTIM'S  UNWILLINGNESS
 TO  DISCLOSE  THE ABUSE DUE TO EMBARRASSMENT, FEAR OR SHAME.  THEREFORE,
 IT IS NECESSARY TO INSTITUTE A SYSTEM WHICH WOULD MAKE  THE  INDIVIDUALS
 TREATING  OR  COMING  INTO  CONTACT  WITH  PERSONS  WHO HAVE PHYSICAL OR
 EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS OF ABUSE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPORTING THIS CRIME TO  THE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
