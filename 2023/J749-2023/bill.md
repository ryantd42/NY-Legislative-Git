Installation Banquet on Saturday, April 15, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  J.  "Bake"  Baker  joined  the  Lee  Center  Fire
Department  on  November 1, 1972; throughout his 50 years of service, he
held several positions within the Department including Chief at the  age

and President for the last 35 years; and

  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
