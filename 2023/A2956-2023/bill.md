  §  1060. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY. THE LEGISLATURE

 THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE PROGRAM OF  STATE  SUPPORT  TO  HELP  MEET  THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARTICLE SEVENTEEN OF
 THIS  CHAPTER,  A  FURTHER  PUBLIC NEED EXISTS FOR STATE FUNDING FOR THE
 DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING OF TWENTY UNITS OR LESS.  IT IS
 THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE TO ENCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF  AFFORDABLE
 RENTAL  HOUSING  IN THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE BY ESTABLISHING A DEDI-
 CATED PROGRAM OF SUCH FUNDING.
  § 1061. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE,  THE  FOLLOWING
 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
