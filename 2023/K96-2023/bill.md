  WHEREAS, The J. Walter Juckett Award, named in honor of the longtime
chairman  of  the  Sandy  Hill  Corporation, was created 34 years ago to
recognize and  honor  a  deserving  member  of  the  community  who  has
selflessly gone above and beyond by contributing time and energy to help
others; Dr. John Rugge is one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in  1914,  the  Adirondack  Regional  Chamber  of

and Northern Saratoga Counties with a mission to serve its  members  and
business community through advocacy efforts, education opportunities and
the power of connection and collaboration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1974,  family physician Dr. John Rugge decided to take
some time off from his busy life to finish writing a book about canoeing

Falls  Hospital  to serve as supervising physician at a brand-new health
center in Chestertown, New York, with the intention  of  practicing  for
six months before returning to Albany Medical Center; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As it turned out, the call of the mountains and the people
of the region who needed him the most inspired him to stay, and Dr. John
Rugge continued his work of making the  area  a  better  place  for  its
residents  to  live,  work  and  play;  he  fulfilled this commitment by

with some 200 medical providers and more than 150,000 patients; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  John  Rugge  furthered  his  aspirations  to  make  a

enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their

the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
