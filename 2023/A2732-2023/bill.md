 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education law, the insurance law and the public
  health law, in relation to providing for dispensing emergency  contra-
  ception under certain conditions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "unintended pregnancy prevention act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings. The United States Food and Drug Adminis-
 tration (FDA) has declared emergency contraceptive drugs to be safe  and
 effective.  There  is  neither  medical  nor public health research that
 validates an age restriction on access to emergency contraception  (EC).
 Furthermore,  no specific medical conditions preclude a woman from using
 EC. The only contraindication to EC use is pregnancy itself, not because
 it represents a danger to the woman or to  the  embryo  but  because  it
 would  be inefficient in preventing the pregnancy. Pregnancy prevention,
 not abortion, is caused by the use of emergency contraceptive drugs.
  The legislature deems it necessary to guarantee immediate access to EC
 to all, especially young women. Nearly thirty percent of  United  States
 teenage girls become pregnant before reaching twenty years of age. Teens
 are  more  likely than adults to experience contraceptive failure, which
 may lead to unintended pregnancies and  consequently  dangerous  medical
 issues for both mother and baby.
  The legislature deems it necessary to create a structure for simplify-
 ing  access  to  EC for these women, while respecting and preserving the
 prescribing scope of practice for physicians, nurse  practitioners,  and
 midwives;  the treating and case-finding scope of practice of registered

 professional nurses; and the dispensing scope  of  practice  of  pharma-
 cists.  This  act does not alter the scope of such professions, nor does
 this legislation interfere with non-prescription access to EC  where  it
 is otherwise lawful.
  §  3.  Subdivision 6 of section 6527 of the education law, as added by
 chapter 573 of the laws of 1999, paragraph (c) as amended by chapter 464
