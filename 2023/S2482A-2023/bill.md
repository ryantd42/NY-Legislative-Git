 AN ACT to amend the emergency tenant protection act of  nineteen  seven-
  ty-four,  and  the  administrative  code  of  the city of New York, in
  relation to penalties for owners of property who fail to file a proper
  or timely rent registration statement
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  opening paragraph of paragraph 1 of subdivision a of
 section 12 of section 4 of chapter 576 of the laws of 1974, constituting
 the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, as amended
 by section 1 of part F of chapter 36 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to
 read as follows:
  Subject to the conditions and limitations of this paragraph, any owner
 of housing accommodations in a city having a population of less than one
 million  or a town or village as to which an emergency has been declared
 pursuant to section three, who, upon complaint of a  tenant  or  of  the
 state  division  of housing and community renewal, is found by the state
 division of housing and community renewal, after a  reasonable  opportu-
 nity to be heard, to have collected an overcharge above the rent author-
 ized  for a housing accommodation subject to this act shall be liable to
 the tenant for a penalty equal to  [three]  AT  LEAST  THREE  TIMES  THE
 AMOUNT,  NOT  TO EXCEED FIVE times the amount of such overcharge. If the
 owner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge
 was neither willful nor attributable to his OR HER negligence, the state
 division of housing and community renewal shall establish the penalty as
 the amount of the overcharge plus interest at the rate of interest paya-
 ble on a judgment pursuant to section five thousand four  of  the  civil
 practice  law  and  rules. After a complaint of rent overcharge has been
 filed and served on an owner,  the  voluntary  adjustment  of  the  rent

 and/or the voluntary tender of a refund of rent overcharges shall not be
 considered  by  the division of housing and community renewal or a court
 of competent jurisdiction as evidence that the overcharge was not  will-
 ful.  (i)  Except as to complaints filed pursuant to clause (ii) of this
 paragraph, the legal regulated rent for purposes of determining an over-
 charge, shall be deemed to be the rent  indicated  in  the  most  recent
 reliable  annual  registration  statement  for  a rent stabilized tenant
 filed and served upon the tenant six or more years  prior  to  the  most
 recent  registration statement, (or, if more recently filed, the initial
 registration  statement)  plus  in  each  case  any  subsequent  lawful
 increases and adjustments. The division of housing and community renewal
 or  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction, in investigating complaints of
 overcharge and in determining legal regulated rent, shall  consider  all
 available rent history which is reasonably necessary to make such deter-
 minations. (ii) As to complaints filed within ninety days of the initial
 registration  of  a  housing accommodation, the legal regulated rent for
 purposes of determining an overcharge shall be deemed  to  be  the  rent
 charged on the date six years prior to the date of the initial registra-
 tion  of the housing accommodation (or, if the housing accommodation was
 subject to this act for less than six years, the initial legal regulated
 rent) plus in each case, any lawful increases and adjustments. Where the
 rent charged on the date six years prior to  the  date  of  the  initial
 registration of the accommodation cannot be established, such rent shall
 be established by the division.
  §  2. The opening paragraph of subdivision  a of section 26-516 of the
 administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by section 4  of
 part F of chapter 36 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  Subject  to  the  conditions  and limitations of this subdivision, any
 owner of housing accommodations who, upon complaint of a tenant,  or  of
 the  state  division  of  housing and community renewal, is found by the
 state division of housing and  community  renewal,  after  a  reasonable
 opportunity  to be heard, to have collected an overcharge above the rent
 authorized for a housing accommodation subject to this chapter shall  be
 liable to the tenant for a penalty equal to [three] AT LEAST THREE TIMES
 THE  AMOUNT,  NOT TO EXCEED FIVE times the amount of such overcharge. If
 the owner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the  over-
 charge  was  not  willful,  the  state division of housing and community
 renewal shall establish the penalty as the amount of the overcharge plus
 interest. After a complaint of rent overcharge has been filed and served
 on an owner, the voluntary adjustment of the rent and/or  the  voluntary
 tender  of  a  refund of rent overcharges shall not be considered by the
 division of housing and community renewal or a court of competent juris-
 diction as evidence that the overcharge was not willful. (i)  Except  as
 to complaints filed pursuant to clause (ii) of this paragraph, the legal
 regulated  rent  for purposes of determining an overcharge, shall be the
 rent indicated in the most recent reliable annual registration statement
 filed and served upon the tenant six or more years  prior  to  the  most
 recent  registration statement, (or, if more recently filed, the initial
 registration  statement)  plus  in  each  case  any  subsequent  lawful
 increases and adjustments. The division of housing and community renewal
 or  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction, in investigating complaints of
 overcharge and in determining legal regulated rent, shall  consider  all
 available rent history which is reasonably necessary to make such deter-
 minations. (ii) As to complaints filed within ninety days of the initial
 registration  of a housing accommodation, the legal regulated rent shall
 be deemed to be the rent charged on the date six years prior to the date

 of the initial registration of the housing  accommodation  (or,  if  the
 housing  accommodation  was  subject  to  this chapter for less than six
 years, the initial legal regulated rent) plus in each case,  any  lawful
 increases  and adjustments. Where the rent charged on the date six years
 prior to the date of  the  initial  registration  of  the  accommodation
 cannot be established, such rent shall be established by the division.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to section 26-516 of chapter 4 of title 26 of the  admin-
 istrative  code  of the city of New York made by section two of this act
 shall expire on the same date as such law expires and shall  not  affect
 the expiration of such law as provided under section 26-520 of such law.
