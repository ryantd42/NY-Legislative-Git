 RY  MEMBERS.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH AGENCY SIZE SHALL DECREASE TO

 CHAIRPERSON and file with  the  secretary  of  state  a  certificate  of
 appointment  or  reappointment of any member. Such members shall receive
 no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to  the  neces-
 sary  expenses,  including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge
 of their duties.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
