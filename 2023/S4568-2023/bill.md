  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  The  real  property  tax  law  is amended by adding a new

  § 458-D. EXEMPTION FOR NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS AND  RESERVISTS.  1.  AS
 USED IN THIS SECTION:
  (A)  "QUALIFIED  OWNER"  MEANS  AN  ACTIVE  OR  RETIRED  MEMBER OF THE
 NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES. WHERE PROPERTY IS OWNED  BY  MORE  THAN  ONE
 QUALIFIED  OWNER,  THE  EXEMPTION  TO  WHICH  EACH  IS  ENTITLED  MAY BE
 COMBINED.
  (B) "QUALIFYING RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY" MEANS PROPERTY OWNED  BY  A
 QUALIFIED  OWNER  WHICH  IS  USED  EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES;
 PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT IN THE EVENT ANY PORTION OF SUCH PROPERTY IS  NOT
 SO  USED  EXCLUSIVELY  FOR  RESIDENTIAL  PURPOSES  BUT IS USED FOR OTHER
 PURPOSES, SUCH PORTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION  AND  THE  REMAINING
 PORTION  ONLY  SHALL  BE  ENTITLED  TO  THE  EXEMPTION  PROVIDED BY THIS
 SECTION. SUCH PROPERTY MUST BE THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE  OF  THE  QUALIFIED
 OWNER,  UNLESS  THE  QUALIFIED  OWNER IS ABSENT FROM THE PROPERTY DUE TO
 MEDICAL REASONS OR INSTITUTIONALIZATION.
  (C) "MUNICIPALITY" MEANS A COUNTY, TOWN, CITY OR VILLAGE.
  2. THE GOVERNING BODY OF ANY MUNICIPALITY  ACTING  THROUGH  ITS  LOCAL
 LEGISLATIVE  BODY  OR  OTHER  GOVERNING AGENCY, IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND
 EMPOWERED TO ADOPT AND AMEND LOCAL LAWS  OR  ORDINANCES  PROVIDING  THAT
 QUALIFYING  REAL  PROPERTY MAY BE EXEMPT FROM REAL PROPERTY TAXES, IN AN
 AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE PERCENT OF THE ASSESSED  VALUE  OF  SUCH  PROPERTY.

 SUCH  EXEMPTION SHALL NOT BE IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER MILITARY EXEMPTION
 OR ABATEMENT OF TAXES AUTHORIZED BY LAW.
  3.  SUCH  EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION SHALL BE GRANTED UPON AN APPLICATION
 WHICH SHALL INCLUDE A STATEMENT THAT A QUALIFIED OWNER  RESIDES  AT  THE
 PROPERTY.  APPLICATION SHALL BE MADE ANNUALLY UPON A FORM TO BE PROMUL-
 GATED BY THE COMMISSIONER AND SHALL INCLUDE  A  COPY  OF  THE  QUALIFIED
 OWNER'S  TWENTY-YEAR  FAVORABLE  SERVICE  LETTER  FROM THE UNITED STATES
 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. THE APPLICATION AND TWENTY-YEAR FAVORABLE SERVICE
 LETTER SHALL BE FILED BY THE QUALIFIED OWNER TO  THE  ASSESSOR  OF  SUCH
 MUNICIPALITY  WHICH  HAS THE POWER TO ASSESS PROPERTY FOR TAXATION ON OR
 BEFORE THE APPROPRIATE TAXABLE STATUS DATE OF SUCH MUNICIPALITY. IF  THE
 ASSESSOR  IS  SATISFIED  THAT THE PROPERTY IS QUALIFIED FOR AN EXEMPTION
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, THEN SUCH RESIDENTIAL  IMPROVEMENTS  SHALL  BE
 EXEMPT FROM TAXATION AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
