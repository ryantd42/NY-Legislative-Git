 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the North Shore  Land  Alliance,  Inc.
  to file with the county of Nassau assessor an application for a retro-
  active real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the North Shore Land Alliance, Inc. an application  for  exemption  from
 real  property  taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax
 law for the 2022-2023 assessment roll for all of  the  2022-2023  school
 taxes  and all of the 2023 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such
 organization located at Foxfield Lane, village of Oyster Bay Cove,  town
 of Oyster Bay, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel
 ID  section  27 block G lots 1750 and 1751. If accepted, the application
 shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or  before  the  taxable
 status date established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
