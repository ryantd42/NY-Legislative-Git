 Introduced  by  Sens.  HINCHEY,  KAVANAGH, HELMING, MANNION, MAY -- read
  twice and ordered printed, and when printed to  be  committed  to  the
  Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the private housing finance law, in relation to estab-
  lishing a New York Main Street development center

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a new
 article 32 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE XXXII
  NEW YORK MAIN STREET
  DEVELOPMENT CENTER
 SECTION 1300. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  1301. NEW YORK MAIN STREET DEVELOPMENT CENTER.
  § 1300. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THE LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS  THAT  WITH
 AFFORDABLE  HOUSING  IN  INCREASINGLY  SHORT  SUPPLY,  THE NEW YORK MAIN
 STREET DEVELOPMENT CENTER WILL NOT ONLY BE THE  CATALYST  FOR  COMMUNITY
 RENEWAL, BUT ALSO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE OPPOR-
 TUNITIES  ACROSS  THE  STATE.  MAIN STREETS AND DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS COULD
 SERVE AS THE PRIMARY LOCATION FOR NEW HOUSING  OPPORTUNITIES  THROUGHOUT
 THIS  STATE.  MAIN STREETS AND DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICTS, ARE UNIQUELY
 EQUIPPED TO SERVE THIS FUNCTION SINCE THESE  AREAS  BOAST  UNDERUTILIZED
 WATER  AND  SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE, ARE THE HUBS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,
 AND ARE THE CENTERS OF COMMERCE.
  § 1301. NEW YORK MAIN STREET DEVELOPMENT CENTER. THE DIVISION OF HOUS-
 ING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT
 OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE DEPARTMENT  OF  STATE,  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF
 TRANSPORTATION, AND THE OFFICE OF PARKS, RECREATION AND HISTORIC PRESER-
 VATION  TO  ESTABLISH A "NEW YORK MAIN STREET DEVELOPMENT CENTER" WITHIN
 SUCH DIVISION. THE MAIN STREET DEVELOPMENT  CENTER  SHALL  HAVE  AS  ITS
 MISSION  THE  DISSEMINATION  OF  INFORMATION  RELATED  TO EXISTING STATE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6518  2
 
 PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING COMMERCIAL/RESIDENTIAL
 "MAIN STREET" BUILDINGS. THE "NEW YORK MAIN STREET  DEVELOPMENT  CENTER"
 SHALL  BE  LOCATED  WITHIN THE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL
 AND  WILL SERVE AS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCE CENTER TO PROVIDE
 INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ANY LOCAL MAIN STREET REVITALI-
 ZATION EFFORTS IN THE STATE. THE CENTER WILL ESTABLISH A WEB PAGE  WHICH
 WILL  LINK  TOGETHER  ALL STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS WHICH MAY BE
 AVAILABLE TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE FOR BOTH DEVELOPERS, AND COMMUNITY  AND
 LOCAL  HOUSING  ORGANIZATIONS  IN  THEIR  DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION INITI-
 ATIVES. THE CENTER SHALL ALSO LEND TECHNICAL AND TRAINING ASSISTANCE  TO
 COMMUNITY  OFFICIALS  AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY OF MAIN STREET
 DEVELOPMENT PUBLICATIONS FROM THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES  WHICH  SHALL
 BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
