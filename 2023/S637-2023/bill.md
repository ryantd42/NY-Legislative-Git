 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Corporations,  Authorities
  and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the public authorities law, the transportation law and
  the general municipal law, in relation to establishing  a  closed-cir-
  cuit  television  system and surveillance personal privacy act; and to
  amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation  to  the  operation  of
  traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative  findings  and  declarations.  The  legislature
 finds  and  declares  the state has increasingly used camera systems and
 other surveillance technologies to monitor the daily legal activities of
 its citizens. Even in public and quasi-public forums, increasing use  of
 government surveillance has a chilling effect on the freedoms and activ-
 ities  of  its citizens. Therefore, the legislature finds that the state
 has an obligation to establish a policy in which  the  public's  privacy
 interests  are  protected  where camera systems are increasingly used in
 traffic enforcement, surveillance and other areas. Where these  surveil-
 lance  systems are used, the state has an obligation to protect an indi-
 vidual's right of personal privacy,  and  consequently,  must  take  all
 steps  to  protect  personal privacy in all aspects of system planning,
 design, deployment, operation and maintenance and shall not  collect  or
 disseminate any personal identifier information.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by adding a new article 1-B
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 1-B
  PUBLIC AUTHORITY CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEM

 SECTION 52. DEFINITIONS.
  53. OPERATION OF CCTV SYSTEMS; PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.
