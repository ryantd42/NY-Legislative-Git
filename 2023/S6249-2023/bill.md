  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The highway law is amended by adding a new section 205-c to
 read as follows:
  § 205-C. MINIMUM MAINTENANCE ROADS. 1. A. THE TOWN BOARD OF ANY DESIG-
 NATED TOWN MAY, AFTER A PUBLIC HEARING, ADOPT A  LOCAL  LAW  DESIGNATING
 ANY  LOW-VOLUME ROAD OR PORTION THEREOF PROVIDING AGRICULTURAL OR RECRE-
 ATIONAL LAND ACCESS, EXCEPT FOR FARM ACCESS ROADS OR ROADS THAT  PROVIDE
 ACCESS TO AN INDIVIDUAL YEAR-ROUND RESIDENCE AT THE TIME OF DESIGNATION,
 AS  A  MINIMUM  MAINTENANCE  ROAD. NO SUCH LAW SHALL RESTRICT FARM OPER-
 ATIONS IN AN AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. SUCH LOCAL LAW SHALL NOT PREVENT THE
 STATE FROM MAINTAINING SUCH ROAD IF THE ROAD PASSES  OVER,  OR  PROVIDES
 ACCESS  TO,  STATE  LAND.  NO SUCH LAW DESIGNATING A MINIMUM MAINTENANCE
 ROAD SHALL BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL SIGNS ARE POSTED ADVISING THE PUBLIC  THAT
 SUCH  ROAD  IS  A  MINIMUM  MAINTENANCE ROAD. NO ROAD, ONCE DESIGNATED A
 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE ROAD, SHALL BE DETERMINED  TO  HAVE  BEEN  ABANDONED
 PURSUANT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS  OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED
 FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE SOLELY BECAUSE IT HAS  BEEN  DESIGNATED  A  MINIMUM
 MAINTENANCE ROAD.
  B.  AT LEAST FORTY-FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEARING ON SUCH LOCAL
 LAW THE TOWN BOARD HAVING JURISDICTION OVER SUCH ROAD SHALL ISSUE  FIND-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  (III) A DETERMINATION THAT THE  USERS  OF  THE  ROAD  TRAVELING  AT  A
 REASONABLE  AND  PRUDENT  SPEED,  UNDER  THE CIRCUMSTANCES, SHALL NOT BE
 PLACED IN A HAZARDOUS SITUATION;
  (IV) A DETERMINATION THAT SUCH ROAD,  OR  PORTION  THEREOF,  DOES  NOT
 CONSTITUTE A FARM ACCESS ROAD AS DEFINED IN THIS SECTION; AND
  (V)  THE  EFFECT  OF SUCH DESIGNATION ON ANY FARM OPERATIONS DEPENDENT
 UPON THE ROAD, AND THAT SUCH DESIGNATION DOES NOT  RESTRICT  FARM  OPER-

 PROCEED WITHOUT SAID BOARD'S  RECOMMENDATION  AND  FINDINGS.  SCHOOL  OR
 PLANNING  BOARD  REVIEW MAY BE WAIVED, SHORTENED OR EXTENDED UPON MUTUAL
 CONSENT OF SAID BOARD AND THE TOWN BOARD. THE TOWN  BOARD  OF  THE  TOWN

 GENERAL TERMS DESCRIBING THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION. SUCH NOTICE  SHALL  BE
 PUBLISHED  ONCE  AT  LEAST FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO THE DAY SPECIFIED FOR SUCH
 HEARING.
  2. A ROAD OR ROAD SEGMENT LOCATED WITHIN A DESIGNATED TOWN, WHICH  HAS
 BEEN  DESIGNATED  MINIMUM  MAINTENANCE,  SHALL BE MAINTAINED AT THE SAME

 ACCESS TO FARMLAND BY A FARM OPERATION ELIGIBLE FOR AGRICULTURAL ASSESS-
 MENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE TWENTY-FIVE-AA OF THE AGRICULTURE  AND  MARKETS
 LAW.  MINIMUM  MAINTENANCE ROADS SHALL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE TOWN
