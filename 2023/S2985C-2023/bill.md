 Introduced  by  Sens.  KAVANAGH,  CLEARE,  SEPULVEDA  --  read twice and
  ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on
  Housing, Construction and Community Development
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the private housing finance law and the local finance
  law, in relation to affordable housing in cities having  a  population
  of one million or more
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a  new
 article 32 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE XXXII
  AFFORDABILITY PLUS PROGRAM
 SECTION 1290. SHORT TITLE.
  1291. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1292. DEFINITIONS.

  §  1290.  SHORT TITLE. THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS
 THE "AFFORDABILITY  PLUS PROGRAM".
  § 1291. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE
 HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT THERE IS, IN CITIES HAVING  A  POPULATION
 OF  ONE MILLION OR MORE, A SERIOUSLY INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SAFE AND SANI-
 TARY HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL REACH OF  FAMILIES  AND
 PERSONS OF LOW INCOME. THIS CONDITION IS CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST
 AND  THREATENS  THE HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE, COMFORT AND SECURITY OF THE
 PEOPLE OF SUCH CITIES. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS AND  DECLARES  THAT
 THE ORDINARY OPERATIONS OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE CANNOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE
 SUPPLY  OF  SAFE  AND SANITARY HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS AT RENTAL AND SALE
