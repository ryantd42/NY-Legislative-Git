 CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, OR AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN  THIS

 SUBDIVISION ARE NOT EQUALLY OPEN TO PARTICIPATION BY MEMBERS OF A  CLASS
 OF  CITIZENS  PROTECTED  BY  SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION IN THAT ITS
 MEMBERS HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY THAN OTHER MEMBERS OF  THE  ELECTORATE  TO
 PARTICIPATE  IN  THE  POLITICAL  PROCESS AND TO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES OF
 THEIR CHOICE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH MEMBERS OF A PROTECTED CLASS HAVE BEEN
 ELECTED TO OFFICE IN THE STATE OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISION IS  ONE  CIRCUM-

 THE  EFFECT OF DENYING OR ABRIDGING THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON ACCOUNT OF RACE
 OR COLOR, RELIGION, GENDER, GENDER IDENTITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR DISA-
 BILITY, OR IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE GUARANTEES SET FORTH IN THE CONSTITU-
 TION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND UNLESS AND  UNTIL  THE  COURT  ENTERS
 SUCH JUDGMENT NO PERSON SHALL BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR FAILURE TO
 COMPLY  WITH  SUCH  QUALIFICATION,  PREREQUISITE, STANDARD, PRACTICE, OR
 PROCEDURE; PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT SUCH QUALIFICATION, PREREQUISITE, STAN-
 DARD, PRACTICE, OR PROCEDURE  MAY  BE  ENFORCED  IF  THE  QUALIFICATION,

 STANDARD, PRACTICE, OR PROCEDURE.
  C. IN THE EVENT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AFFIRMATIVELY INDICATES  THAT  NO
 OBJECTION  WILL BE MADE WITHIN THE SIXTY DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF
 A SUBMISSION, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY RESERVE THE  RIGHT  TO  REEXAMINE
 THE  SUBMISSION  IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMES TO HIS ATTENTION DURING
 THE REMAINDER OF THE SIXTY DAY  PERIOD  WHICH  WOULD  OTHERWISE  REQUIRE
 OBJECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION. ANY ACTION UNDER THIS SECTION
 SHALL  BE  HEARD  AND DETERMINED BY A THREE JUDGE PANEL OF THE APPELLATE
 DIVISION IN THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT  WITHIN  WHICH  THE  SUBDIVISION  OR
 MUNICIPAL CORPORATION IS SITUATED, AND ANY APPEAL SHALL LIE TO THE COURT
 OF APPEALS.
  2.  ANY  VOTING  QUALIFICATION OR PREREQUISITE TO VOTING, OR STANDARD,
 PRACTICE, OR PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO VOTING THAT HAS THE PURPOSE OF OR
 WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF DIMINISHING THE ABILITY OF ANY CITIZENS  OF  THE
 UNTIED  STATES  ON  ACCOUNT  OF  RACE OR COLOR, RELIGION, GENDER, GENDER
 IDENTITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR DISABILITY, OR IN CONTRAVENTION  OF  THE
 GUARANTEES  SET  FORTH  IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, TO
