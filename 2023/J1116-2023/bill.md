  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to

Course in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 67th Precinct Clergy  Council,  Inc.  is  a  charitable
organization  in  New  York  City,  and in 2010, they partnered with The
GodSquad to help fight against gun violence; guided by the  belief  that
the  welfare  and  safety  of  their  diverse  community  is  a  shared
responsibility, they have adopted a holistic approach to help  to  lower
youth  involvement  in  senseless  gun violence and build safer and more
peaceful communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Given their transformative model of both  preventative  and
crisis  response,  they offer crime and gun violence prevention programs
and training, provide support to members of  the  community,  and  offer
solutions  to problems arising in the 67th Precinct and across the city;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The core values of The GodSquad revolve  around  supporting
families  impacted by gun violence, advocating for support and resources
to rebuild communities, forging community partnerships,  and  empowering
individuals through personal development; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The organization works to help victims of gun violence and
their loved ones turn pain into purpose with a distinct level of empathy
after the tragedy with their holistic, faith-based approach; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  67th  Precinct Clergy Council upon the occasion of hosting
its 13th Annual Evening of Remembrance & Reflection on  June  22,  2023;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the 67th Precinct Clergy Council, and The GodSquad.
