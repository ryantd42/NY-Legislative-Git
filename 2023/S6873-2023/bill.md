 VIDUAL STATE NURSE LICENSURE LAWS DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX;

 RECOGNITION OF PARTY STATE LICENSES;

 PROMOTES PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AS WELL AS PROVIDING A

 ING STATE OF OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES INCURRED DURING  THE  PERIOD  OF
 DEFAULT.
  3.  TERMINATION  OF  MEMBERSHIP  IN THIS COMPACT SHALL BE IMPOSED ONLY
 AFTER ALL OTHER MEANS OF SECURING COMPLIANCE HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. NOTICE

 EXTEND BEYOND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMINATION.
  5.  THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT BEAR ANY COSTS RELATED TO A STATE THAT IS
 FOUND TO BE IN DEFAULT OR WHOSE MEMBERSHIP  IN  THIS  COMPACT  HAS  BEEN

 PETITIONING THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR  THE
 FEDERAL  DISTRICT IN WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES. THE
 PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED ALL COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION,  INCLUD-
 ING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES.
  C. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
  1.  UPON  REQUEST  BY  A  PARTY STATE, THE COMMISSION SHALL ATTEMPT TO
 RESOLVE DISPUTES RELATED TO THE COMPACT THAT ARISE  AMONG  PARTY  STATES
 AND BETWEEN PARTY AND NON-PARTY STATES.

 AND BINDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR DISPUTES, AS APPROPRIATE.

 STATES ARISING UNDER THIS COMPACT:
 S. 6873  28
 
  I. THE PARTY STATES MAY SUBMIT THE ISSUES IN DISPUTE TO AN ARBITRATION
 PANEL, WHICH WILL BE COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED BY  THE  COMPACT
 ADMINISTRATOR  IN  EACH  OF  THE AFFECTED PARTY STATES AND AN INDIVIDUAL
 MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY THE COMPACT  ADMINISTRATORS  OF  ALL  THE  PARTY
 STATES INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE.
  II.  THE  DECISION OF A MAJORITY OF THE ARBITRATORS SHALL BE FINAL AND
 BINDING.
  D. ENFORCEMENT.
  1. THE COMMISSION, IN THE REASONABLE EXERCISE OF ITS DISCRETION, SHALL
 ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS AND RULES OF THIS COMPACT.

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR THE FEDERAL
 DISTRICT  IN  WHICH  THE  COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES AGAINST A
 PARTY STATE THAT IS IN DEFAULT TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS
 OF THIS COMPACT AND ITS PROMULGATED RULES AND BYLAWS. THE RELIEF  SOUGHT
 MAY  INCLUDE  BOTH  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT JUDICIAL
 ENFORCEMENT IS NECESSARY, THE PREVAILING  PARTY  SHALL  BE  AWARDED  ALL
 COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES.
  3.  THE  REMEDIES  HEREIN  SHALL  NOT BE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF THE
 COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION MAY PURSUE ANY OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER
 FEDERAL OR STATE LAW.
