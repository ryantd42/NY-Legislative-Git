 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to establishing  the  New
  York small contractor relief act; provides for the repeal upon expira-
  tion thereof; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York small contractor relief act".
  § 2. The legislature hereby declares that the market for insurance for
 small  construction  contractors  and certified minority and women-owned
 construction contractors has been  challenged  both  by  high  insurance
 rates  and  a  lack  of  market capacity. These challenges are acute for
 small  construction  contractors,  and  minority  and  women-owned
 construction  contractors  working  for  public  owners.  This act shall
 provide for a private market insurance solution for  small  construction
 contractors,  and  minority  and  women-owned  construction  contractors
 through the creation of a captive insurance company.
  § 3. The insurance law is amended by adding a new article 70-A to read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 70-A
  NEW YORK SMALL CONTRACTOR RELIEF ACT
 SECTION 7013. DEFINITIONS.
  7014. NEW YORK SMALL CONTRACTOR CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY.
  7015. REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSION REINSURANCE.
  7016. NO REFUSAL.
  7017. RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.
  7018. PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 the insurance and labor committees  of  each  house,  a  report  on  the
 performance  of  the New York small contractor relief act and its impact
 upon the small construction contractor sector. If such act is to expire,
 it shall not impede such captive insurance companies created under arti-
 cle 70-A of  the  insurance  law  to  continue  to  operate  as  if  the

 priated  for  the  support  of  up to two captives under this act.  Such
