  § 2. The legislature hereby declares that the market for insurance for

 rates and a lack of market capacity.  These  challenges  are  acute  for
 small  construction  contractors,  and  minority  and  women-owned
 construction contractors working  for  public  owners.  This  act  shall
 provide  for  a private market insurance solution for small construction
 contractors,  and  minority  and  women-owned  construction  contractors
 through the creation of a captive insurance company.
