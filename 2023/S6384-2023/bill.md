 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to  establishing  certain
  duties  for  pharmacies  when  pharmacists  employed by the pharmacies
  refuse to fill prescriptions on the basis of personal beliefs

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that an indi-
 vidual's right to religious beliefs and worship is a  protected,  funda-
 mental  right in the state of New York and that an individual's right to
 access legal contraception is a  protected,  fundamental  right  in  the
 state  of  New York. The legislature thereby recognizes that an individ-
 ual's right to religious belief and worship cannot  impede  an  individ-
 ual's access to legal prescriptions, including contraception.
  §  2.  The  education law is amended by adding a new section 6810-a to
 read as follows:
  § 6810-A. DUTIES OF A PHARMACY; FILLING VALID  PRESCRIPTIONS.  1.  A
 PHARMACY  RECEIVING  AND FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS SHALL MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE
 WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
  (A) IF A PRODUCT IS IN STOCK AND A PHARMACIST EMPLOYED BY  A  PHARMACY
 REFUSES  ON  THE BASIS OF A PERSONAL BELIEF TO FILL A VALID PRESCRIPTION
 FOR SUCH PRODUCT, THE PHARMACY ENSURES, SUBJECT TO THE  CONSENT  OF  THE
 INDIVIDUAL PRESENTING THE PRESCRIPTION IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE INDIVID-
 UAL HAS REASON TO KNOW OF THE REFUSAL, THAT THE PRESCRIPTION IS, WITHOUT
 DELAY, FILLED BY ANOTHER PHARMACIST EMPLOYED BY SUCH PHARMACY; OR
  (B)  SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF THIS PARAGRAPH,
 IF A PRODUCT IS NOT IN STOCK AND A PHARMACIST EMPLOYED BY  THE  PHARMACY
 REFUSES  ON  THE  BASIS OF A PERSONAL BELIEF OR ON THE BASIS OF PHARMACY
 POLICY TO ORDER OR TO OFFER TO ORDER THE PRODUCT WHEN PRESENTED  WITH  A
 VALID PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PRODUCT, THE PHARMACY SHALL ENSURE:
