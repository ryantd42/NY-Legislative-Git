  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 5, 2023, as Guru Gobind Singh Jayanti Day in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The true architects of  society  and  community  are  those
extraordinary  individuals  whose  faith and unremitting commitment have
served to sustain the spiritual and cultural values of life; Sikh leader
Guru Gobind Singh was undoubtedly such an individual; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 5, 2023, as Guru Gobind Singh
Jayanti Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The festival honors and  remembers  the  Sikh  leader  Guru
Gobind  Singh,  a  truly inspirational man who was also a warrior, poet,
philosopher, and spiritual master; and
 
  WHEREAS, Guru Gobind Singh was the son of the ninth Sikh guru,  Guru
Tegh  Bahadur;  after his father was killed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb,
Singh became a Sikh leader when he was merely nine years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his purposeful life, Guru  Gobind  Singh  fought
against  Muslim  rulers  and the injustices committed by them; he became
renowned for his skills as a warrior and for the way he lived  his  life
to set an example for others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, Guru Gobind Singh not only mastered the art of
fighting,  but  also focused on spreading his philosophical teachings in
the Sikh community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Guru Gobind Singh also started  the  tradition  of  Khalsa,
which  includes Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb), Kara (an iron
or steel bracelet worn on the wrist), Kripan (a sword  or  dagger),  and
Kacchera (short breeches); and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  tradition  birthed  a new ceremony for Sikh warriors
whose duty was to protect people from religious persecution; during this
ceremony, a Khalsa Sikh was given the title of a Singh, whereas a female
was called Kaur; and
 
  WHEREAS, The tradition of Khalsa in Guru Gobind's life became a  way
of life and the warriors had to follow a very strict code of conduct; he
also  finalized  the  "Kartarpur  Pothi," a manuscript of the great Guru
Granth Sahib which serves as the primary scripture of Sikhism; in total,
this extraordinary man fought 13 wars against the Mughal Empire; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his purposeful  journey  of  life,  Guru  Gobind
Singh  compiled, with dignity and kindness, decades filled with gracious
literary works, moral causes, and humanitarian efforts,  justly  earning
the  devotion  of  his  followers  and the admiration and respect of his
fellow man; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 5, 2023, as Guru
Gobind Singh Jayanti Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
