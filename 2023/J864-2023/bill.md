  COMMENDING  Not  Another  Child,  Inc.  upon  the
  occasion of hosting its Pre-Mother's Day Celebration
  on May 6, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations  and  individuals  that  are devoted to the welfare of the
community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Not Another  Child,  Inc.  upon  the  occasion  of  hosting  its
Pre-Mother's  Day Celebration on Saturday, May 6, 2023, in Brooklyn, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Not Another Child, Inc. was established in 2007  after  the
senseless  killing  of Andrell Daron Napper, who was a victim of a stray
bullet that came from a gun being held by a 15-year-old; not wanting his
death to be in vain, Andrell Daron's mother, Oresa Napper-Williams,  and
brother, Justin Napper, knew that despite this tragedy, something had to
be  done to positively change and influence the lives of other families;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The non-profit was created with the  intention  of  helping
inner-city families who are directly impacted by violence; the anchor of
its mission is to align the efforts of their members so that they impact
communities of color on a global level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through programs, workshops and events, Not Another Child,
Inc.  provides reactive and proactive  wholeness  and  healing  through
unconventional  therapeutic  support  services  to  those  that  have
experienced a violent and/or traumatic event; and
 
  WHEREAS, The honorees for the event include Maxine Lewis, in  memory
of her son Carlton Locksley Bennett; Carolyn Dixon, in memory of her son
Darryl  Lynch; Yvette Ramos, in memory of her son Steven Casilla; Kellie
Nixon, in memory of her son Isaiah; Margaret Johnson, in memory  of  her
grandson  Daryl  Eleam; Alice McKay, in memory of her son Kameron McKay;
Pat Glenn, in memory of her daughter Cierra Glenn; Shneaqua CoCo Purvis,
in memory of her sister Maisha "Pumpkin" Hubbard; Oresa Napper-Williams,
in memory of Andrell Daron Napper; and Tammye Brunson, in memory of  her
son Stanley Brian Brunson, Jr.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Not  Another  Child,  Inc.  upon  the  occasion  of hosting its
Pre-Mother's Day Celebration on May 6, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
