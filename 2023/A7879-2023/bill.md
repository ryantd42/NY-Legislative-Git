 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  CUNNINGHAM  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the public service law and the labor law, in relation to
  providing net revenues from utility-owned large-scale renewable gener-
  ation projects to low-income customers and authorizes  utility  compa-
  nies to own such projects

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. 1. New York  state  recog-
 nizes  the  deleterious impacts of climate change including increasingly
 frequent catastrophic weather events.
  2. Pursuant to the New  York  state climate leadership  and  community
 protection  act  (CLCPA),  New  York  state seeks to dramatically reduce
 greenhouse gas emissions and move its electric  generation  from  fossil
 fuel-based  generation to renewable-based generation. New York state has
 mandated that seventy percent of electricity come from renewable  energy
 sources  by  year  2030 and one hundred percent of electricity come from
 carbon neutral sources by 2040.
  3. Further, New York state recognizes that the current pace of  devel-
 opment  of  in-state  renewable energy resources is insufficient to meet
 the state's statutory renewable generation goals on schedule.
  4. Because New York state seeks  to  accomplish  these  energy-related
 goals  and standards as soon as practicable allowing regulated utilities
 to own and operate renewable generation is essential to  achieving  such
 goals  and to provide a consistent and affordable supply of carbon-free,
 renewably generated electricity by 2030, through 2050 and beyond.
  5. New York state seeks to  continue  to  develop  in-state  renewable
 energy  projects that will drive down costs, benefit customers receiving
 retail electric delivery particularly those customers  who  are  low  to
 moderate income.

  6.  New  York state has a proprietary interest in these projects being
 efficiently built and operated without  unnecessary  disruptions,  which
 justifies  the  use  of  project labor agreements and labor peace agree-
 ments.
  § 2. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 66-w to
 read as follows:
  §  66-W.  REGULATED  LARGE  SCALE RENEWABLE GENERATION. 1. IN ORDER TO
