  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 378 of the executive law is amended by  adding  two
 new subdivisions 20 and 21 to read as follows:
  20. A. STANDARDS FOR FIRE HYDRANT SYSTEMS SHALL REQUIRE:
  (I)  PERIODIC  FIRE  HYDRANT  TESTS,  FIRE  HYDRANT FLUSHING, AND FIRE
 HYDRANT WATER FLOW TESTS AS REQUIRED BY THE DESIGNATED LOCAL OFFICIAL OR
 CONTRACTED DESIGNEE ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE  ESTABLISHED
 BY THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION;
  (II)  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, EACH FIRE HYDRANT SHALL BE FLUSHED ANNUALLY,
 AND FIRE HYDRANT WATER FLOW TESTS SHALL BE CONDUCTED A MINIMUM  OF  ONCE
 PER FIVE YEARS; AND
  (III)  RECORDS  OF FIRE HYDRANT TESTS, FIRE HYDRANT FLUSHING, AND FIRE
 HYDRANT WATER FLOW TESTS PERFORMED ON EACH FIRE HYDRANT SHALL  BE  MAIN-
 TAINED FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TEN YEARS BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY RESPON-
 SIBLE FOR CONDUCTING SUCH INSPECTIONS.
  B.  FOR  THE  PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A FIRE HYDRANT SYSTEM SHALL BE
 DEFINED AS A SYSTEM OF PIPES AND  VALVES  SITUATED  AND  MAINTAINED  FOR
 FIREFIGHTING PURPOSES DELIVERING A WATER SUPPLY WITH SUFFICIENT PRESSURE
 AND  FLOW  WITH  A  CONNECTION POINT BY WHICH FIREFIGHTERS CAN ACCESS IT
 WITHOUT RESTRICTION AS TO THE USE FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE LOCATION IS SUCH

 added by section one of this act, shall expire and be deemed repealed on
 the one hundred twentieth day after the department of public service has
 submitted its completed report provided, further, that the department of
 public service shall notify the  legislative  bill  drafting  commission
 upon  the  occurrence of the submission of the completed report in order
 that the commission may maintain an accurate and timely  effective  data
 base of the official text of the laws of the state of New York in furth-
 erance  of  effectuating the provisions of section 44 of the legislative
 law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
