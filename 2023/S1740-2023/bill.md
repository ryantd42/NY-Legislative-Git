 Introduced  by  Sen.  RAMOS  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in relation to  requiring  dental
  insurance  coverage to be offered to employees that is effective imme-
  diately upon the starting date of employment

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 2 of section 160 of the civil service law, as
 amended by chapter 414 of the laws  of  1980,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  The  president,  in  his  discretion, is hereby empowered to make,
 amend and rescind, from time to time, regulations establishing a  dental
 insurance  plan  which  shall  be  a  part  of the health insurance plan
 authorized by this article. Such regulations may provide for negotiating
 unit, employee and employer participation or nonparticipation, employee,
 dependent and retiree eligibility or noneligibility  and  such  contrib-
 ution  rates as the president may determine even though such regulations
 establish standards which differ from those applicable by law  to  other
 parts  of such health insurance plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH REGU-
 LATIONS SHALL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER DENTAL INSURANCE COVERAGE WHICH
 IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE STARTING DATE OF EMPLOYMENT. The pres-
 ident is hereby authorized and directed to provide in  such  regulations
 for  participation  in  the dental insurance plan by retirees; provided,
 however, that the claims experience for  retirees  shall  be  separately
 rated  and  premiums established separate from other participants in the
 plan and provided further that the full costs of participation  in  such
 plan,  including  all administrative costs, shall be borne by such reti-
 rees. Considering the dental insurance plan as a  whole,  no  regulation
 enacted  pursuant  to this subdivision shall provide or permit a benefit
 structure inconsistent with the most efficient and  economical  adminis-
 tration of such plan.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
