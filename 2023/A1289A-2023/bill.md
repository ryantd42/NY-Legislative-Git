  §  2.  Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section
 421-f of the real property tax law, as amended by  chapter  590  of  the
 laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  (iii)  Such  exemption shall be limited to [eighty] ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-

 than five thousand dollars as may be provided by the local law or resol-
 ution,  of  the property attributable to such reconstruction, alteration
