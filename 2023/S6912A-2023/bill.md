 AN ACT authorizing Michael J. Cappiello to purchase service  credit  for
  service with the Long Island Railroad Company police department

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law,  Michael  J.
 Cappiello,  a  former  member of the Long Island Railroad Company police
 department, shall be eligible to apply to purchase up to three years  of
 service  credit  for  such  employment with the New York state and local
 police and fire retirement system if, within one year of  the  effective
 date  of  this  act,  he shall (1) file a written request to that effect
 with such retirement system; and (2) shall pay to the New York state and
 local police and fire retirement system a sum equal to  the  product  of
 the  number  of years of service being claimed and three percent of such
 member's compensation  earned  during  the  twelve  months  of  credited
 service  immediately preceding the date that the member made application
 for credit pursuant to this section.
  § 2. All past service costs attributable to the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by the state of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow Michael J. Cappiello, a current  member  of  the
 New  York  State  and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS)
 employed by the County of Suffolk, the ability to purchase up  to  three
 years of service credit for employment as a police officer with the Long
 Island Railroad Company. Under current law, service with the Long Island
 Railroad  Company  must  be  credited in the Metropolitan Transportation
 Authority police retirement program before it can be transferred to  the
 NYSLPFRS. Michael J. Cappiello never became a member of the Metropolitan

 Transportation  Authority police retirement program and therefore has no
 service credit to transfer.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost  of  approximately  $181,000.  Of
 this  amount,  approximately  $13,500  will  be  borne  by the member to
 purchase the additional service. The remaining $167,500 will be borne by
 the State of New York as a one-time payment,  based  on  the  assumption
 that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 County of Suffolk.
