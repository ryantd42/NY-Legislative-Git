 AN  ACT  in relation to establishing a task force to create a comprehen-
  sive plan for the future of the  Southampton  campus  of  Stony  Brook
  University
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 in 2006, the state of New York acquired and established a new campus  at
 Southampton  under  the auspices of Stony Brook University. The legisla-
 ture further finds that it has made a commitment to maintain and  expand
 opportunities for higher education at this campus.
  However,  Stony Brook University has failed to achieve the full poten-
 tial of the campus. Seventeen years after assuming  stewardship  of  the
 Southampton  campus,  Stony  Brook  University  has  failed to adopt and
 implement a long term plan for the campus. In fact, of the 41  buildings
 located  on the campus, 17 are considered to be unsafe for use and occu-
 pancy, including historic Southampton Hall. Further, Stony Brook Univer-
 sity has failed to even apply for state and federal funding  that  could
 have  been utilized to restore or replace these buildings for future use
 on the campus.
  Such neglect is unacceptable.
  A vision for the future of the campus must be created working with the
 local community. The first step to create that vision and  realize  that
 the  full  potential of the campus is the development of a comprehensive
 plan for the Southampton campus. Such a comprehensive plan will identify
 the capital investment and programmatic initiatives that  are  necessary
 to achieve the full potential of the campus.
  Therefore, the intent of this legislation is to establish a task force
 to create a comprehensive plan for the future of the Southampton campus.
