the development of character and leadership in the youth of this nation;
and

and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2021,  Isaiah  Coombs  refurbished the Andrew Fatscher

filled with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations,  in
recognition  of  the  significance  of  this meritorious achievement, to
congratulate and honor Isaiah Coombs on  achieving  the  rank  of  Eagle
Scout; and be it further
