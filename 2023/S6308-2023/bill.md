  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend  Sections  448,
 508,  and  606  of  the  Retirement  and  Social Security Law (RSSL) and
 Section 13-148 of the Administrative  Code  of  the  City  of  New  York
 (ACCNY) to provide an alternative death benefit for Correction and Sani-
 tation  members  in  all Tiers and Plans of the New York City Employees'
 Retirement System (NYCERS).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment for deaths occurring on or  after  July
 1, 2023.
  IMPACT  ON  BENEFITS:  Currently,  NYCERS  Correction  and  Sanitation
 members are generally entitled to a  lump  sum  ordinary  death  benefit
 equal  to  a  multiple  of  salary plus the return of member accumulated
 contributions and increased-take-home-pay (ITHP), if  any.  These  death
 benefits are generally calculated as three times the final year's salary
 raised to the next highest multiple of $1,000. Some of these death bene-
 fits are subject to salary caps and other reductions.
  Under the proposed legislation, the ordinary death benefit for members
 who are otherwise eligible to receive a service retirement benefit would
 be  the  greater  of  their  current  death  benefit or the value of the
 pension reserve that would have been established had they retired on the
 date of their death. The pension reserve is the  present  value  of  all
 payments  expected  to  be made on account of any pension, or benefit in
 lieu of any pension, granted under provisions of law and  computed  upon
 the  basis  of adopted mortality tables with regular interest (inclusive
 of accumulated member contributions and ITHP, if any). This type of lump
 sum pension reserve death benefit is sometimes referred to  as  a  Death
 Gamble, and is afforded, in a similar form, to Tier 1 NYCERS members.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  result in an increase in the Present
 Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) and present  value  of  future  employer
 contributions of approximately $17.3 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to NYCERS, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued  Liability  (UAL) of approximately $11.3 million and an increase
 in the present value of future employer  Normal  Cost  of  approximately
 $6.0 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer contributions of approximately $2.2 million which is the result
 of an increase in the Normal Cost in addition to the UAL payment.
  New  UAL  attributable to benefit changes are generally amortized over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 S. 6308  4
 
 The remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 12  years
 and  the  increase  in UAL was therefore amortized over a 12-year period
 (11 payments under the One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level  dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 6,738 NYCERS Correction members as of June 30, 2022 had an average
 age  of  approximately 42.2 years, average service of approximately 11.5
 years, and an average salary of approximately $120,500.
  The 7,572 NYCERS Sanitation members as of June 30, 2022 had an average
 age of approximately 43.1 years, average service of  approximately  11.7
 years, and an average salary of approximately $104,600.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
