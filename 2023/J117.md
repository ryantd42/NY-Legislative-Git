  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues

New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its

  WHEREAS, On Tuesday, February 7, 2023, the  20th  edition  of  Safer
Internet  Day will celebrate with actions taking place across the globe;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's theme is "Want to Talk about it?"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Whether you are a young person, a parent  or  caregiver,  a
teacher  or  an  educator,  a  policy maker, or whether you represent an
organization or industry, everyone has a role to play  in  creating  and
maintaining a better online world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Noting the global reach of the Safer Internet Day campaign,
global  Safer  Internet Day Committees and a range of organizational and
industry supporters have spent tireless hours  planning  and  discussing
the activities of this vital day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 7, 2023, as Safer
Internet Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
