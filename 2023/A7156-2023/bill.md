  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Section 2575 of
 the  Education  Law  to  require  certain new and existing New York City
 Board of Education Retirement System (BERS) eligible employees, who  are
 non-provisional  and  who are not otherwise already a member in a public
 retirement system within the State, to be enrolled into BERS  membership
 unless the employees timely opt out of such membership.
  Under  current law, these employees have the option of joining BERS by
 filing an application for membership at any time during employment  with
 a BERS participating employer, but enrollment is not mandated.
  The  proposed  legislation would require BERS to enroll new non-provi-
 sional and non-permanent eligible employees (e.g.,  non-competitive  and
 exempt class titles) into BERS membership, within 90 days of employment,
 unless the employee files an application with BERS to opt out of member-
 ship  within the 90-day period. An existing non-provisional and non-per-
 manent eligible employee who is  not  already  a  BERS  member  will  be
 enrolled as a BERS member on October 1, 2024, unless such employee files
 an application with BERS to opt out of membership by September 30, 2024.
  A BERS eligible employee who timely opts out of BERS automatic enroll-
 ment  may  still  join BERS at any time during employment with a partic-
 ipating employer. The proposed  legislation  would  have  no  effect  on
 employees  who are, under existing provisions of law, required to become
 BERS members.
  Effective Date: July 1, 2024.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: If enacted into law,
 the ultimate employer cost for this proposed legislation would be  based
 on  the  number,  ages,  years of service, and salary of those employees
 that would have otherwise not elected to become members of BERS.
  Based on the data and these statistics herein, the Office of the Actu-
 ary (OA) has estimated the following costs for this legislation:
  * The additional annual employer contribution will be $17.4 million if
 no prior years of service are purchased by these individuals.
  * The additional annual employer contribution will be $22.6 million if
 all years of prior service eligible for buyback are purchased  by  these
 individuals.
  Finally, for purposes of determining the portion of the annual employ-
 er  contribution  attributable  to the buyback of prior service, we have
 assumed an amortization period of 15 years (14 payments under  the  One-
 Year Lag Methodology used in the actuarial valuation).
  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on information
 provided by BERS for 23,977 individuals who are non-provisional and  not
 currently  members  of BERS, but could voluntarily elect to participate.
 This group consists of 22,255 part-time and 1,722  full-time  employees,
 A. 7156  4
 
 is  72%  female,  and  has  an average age of 36.2 years, average annual
 salary of approximately $34,800, and average service since date of  hire
 of 3.5 years.
  The  OA was advised that employees in Payroll Codes 056, 744, 745, and
 746 work part-time and earned 0.67 years, 0.28 years,  0.78  years,  and
 0.68  years  of  service per year on average, respectively. Employees in
 Payroll Codes 740 and 742 are assumed to generally be full-time  employ-
 ees.
  The estimate above assumes all eligible employees who are not current-
 ly  BERS members join immediately, of which approximately 50% would have
 eventually joined BERS, and therefore this bill  would  only  accelerate
 membership for certain individuals.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 BERS.
  For  the  purposes  of  this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that since the
 proposed legislation requires  BERS  to  enroll  all  existing  eligible
 employees (who are not already members and who do not opt out) into BERS
 on  October  1,  2024,  the  increase in employer contributions for BERS
 could be first reflected as early as in Fiscal Year 2026.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The potential savings to other New York City Retirement Systems  and
 Pension Funds (NYCRS) as a result of these employees becoming members in
 BERS instead of another NYCRS.
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
  *  The  cost  of potential Tax-Deferred Annuity plan participation and
 benefits.
