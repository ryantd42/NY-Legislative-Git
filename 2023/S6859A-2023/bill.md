  §  396-b.  Advertisements. 1. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "SYNTHETIC

  2. Any person, firm, corporation or association, or agent or  employee
 thereof,  hereinafter  called person, who, being engaged in the business

 other than the true name pursuant to law, then the name under which such
 business is transacted, and each business address wherein  any  business
 is  transacted  by  him,  in  the  class of property advertised or to be
 advertised  for  sale in such advertisement, shall make any false state-
 ment in relation to any of such items; or if requested by the  publisher
 of  any such newspaper, magazine or other publication or owner or opera-
 tor of such radio or television station or any agent  or  representative

 tative thereof a statement showing whether he is causing such advertise-
 ment to appear or is offering to make such sale or disposition or trans-

 set forth such information as is specified in this section, in  relation
 to his principal as well as in relation to himself, shall make any false
 statement in relation to any of such items; is guilty of a misdemeanor.
  3.  ANY  PERSON  ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF DEALING IN ANY PROPERTY OR
 SERVICE WHO FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE MAKES,  PUBLISHES,  DISSEMINATES,
 CIRCULATES  OR PLACES BEFORE THE PUBLIC OR CAUSES, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECT-
 LY, TO BE MADE, PUBLISHED, DISSEMINATED, CIRCULATED OR PLACED BEFORE THE
 PUBLIC ANY ADVERTISEMENT RESPECTING ANY SUCH PROPERTY OR SERVICE, IN ANY
 MEDIUM OR MEDIA IN WHICH SUCH ADVERTISEMENT APPEARS, SHALL  DISCLOSE  IN
 SUCH  ADVERTISEMENT  IF  SYNTHETIC MEDIA IS IN SUCH ADVERTISEMENT, WHERE
 SUCH PERSON KNOWS OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
  (A) IF SYNTHETIC MEDIA HAS BEEN USED IN ANY  COMMERCIAL  ADVERTISEMENT
 UNDER  THIS  SECTION TO CREATE A LIKENESS THAT DEPICTS A NATURAL PERSON,
 WITHOUT THAT PERSON'S CONSENT, ENGAGED IN ANY ACTION  OR  EXPRESSION  IN
 WHICH  THE  NATURAL  PERSON  DID NOT ACTUALLY ENGAGE, SUCH ADVERTISEMENT
 SHALL INCLUDE A DISCLAIMER WHICH CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY  STATES  THAT
 SUCH  LIKENESS  FEATURED  IN  SUCH  ADVERTISEMENT IS SYNTHETIC, DOES NOT
 DEPICT A NATURAL PERSON, AND IS GENERATED TO CREATE A HUMAN LIKENESS.
  (B) IT SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE TO AN ACTION UNDER THIS OR ANY OTHER LAW
 THAT THE DISCLAIMER REQUIRED UNDER PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION HAS
 BEEN INCLUDED IF THE SYNTHETIC MEDIA DEPICTS A  NATURAL  PERSON  WITHOUT
 SUCH NATURAL PERSON'S CONSENT.
  (C) A VIOLATION OF THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL RESULT IN A CIVIL PENALTY OF
 ONE  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  FOR A FIRST VIOLATION, AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
 FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION.
  4. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL LIMIT OR REDUCE ANY RIGHTS ANY PERSON
 MAY HAVE UNDER SECTION FIFTY, FIFTY-F, OR FIFTY-ONE OF THE CIVIL  RIGHTS
 LAW OR UNDER ANY OTHER LAW.
  5. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT, OR TO ENLARGE,
 THE  PROTECTIONS  THAT  47  U.S.C. SECTION 230 CONFERS ON AN INTERACTIVE
 COMPUTER SERVICE FOR CONTENT PROVIDED  BY  ANOTHER  INFORMATION  CONTENT
 PROVIDER, AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN 47 U.S.C. SECTION 230.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
