  not containing warnings
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of  section  400.00  of  the
 penal  law, as amended by chapter 212 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a) Applications shall be made and renewed, in the case of  a  license
 to  carry  or  possess  a  pistol  or  revolver  or  to purchase or take
 possession of a semiautomatic rifle, to the  licensing  officer  in  the
 city  or  county,  as  the  case may be, where the applicant resides, is
 principally employed or has his or her principal place  of  business  as
 merchant  or  storekeeper;  and, in the case of a license as gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms, to the licensing officer where such place  of  busi-
 ness  is  located.  Blank  applications shall, except in the city of New
 York, be approved as to form by the superintendent of state  police.  NO
 APPLICATIONS,  OR THE LITERATURE  GIVEN  THEREWITH,  SHALL  BE APPROVED,
 DISTRIBUTED  OR  USED  IN ANY CAPACITY WHICH CONTAIN AN EXPLICIT WRITTEN
 WARNING REGARDING OWNERSHIP OR USE OF A FIREARM.  An  application  shall
 state  the  full  name,  date of birth, residence, present occupation of
 each person or individual signing the same, whether or not he or she  is
 a  citizen  of the United States, whether or not he or she complies with
 each requirement for eligibility specified in subdivision  one  of  this
 section and such other facts as may be required to show the good charac-
 ter,  competency  and integrity of each person or individual signing the
 application. An application shall be signed and verified by  the  appli-
 cant. Each individual signing an application shall submit one photograph
 of  himself  or  herself  and  a duplicate for each required copy of the

 prior  to  filing  the  application. In case of a license as gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms,  the  photographs  submitted  shall  be  two  inches
 square,  and the application shall also state the previous occupation of
 each individual signing the same and the location of the place  of  such
 business,  or  of the bureau, agency, subagency, office or branch office
 for which the license is sought, specifying the name of the  city,  town
 or  village,  indicating the street and number and otherwise giving such
 apt description as to point out reasonably the location thereof. In such
 case, if the applicant is a firm, partnership or corporation, its  name,
 date  and  place  of formation, and principal place of business shall be
 stated. For such firm or partnership, the application  shall  be  signed
 and  verified  by  each individual composing or intending to compose the
 same, and for such corporation, by each officer thereof.
