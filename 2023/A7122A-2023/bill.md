 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to contract cost  adjust-
  ments in the middle of contract terms for school districts transporta-

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph d of subdivision 14 of section 305 of the  educa-
 tion  law,  as  added  by chapter 552 of the laws of 1995, is amended to
 read as follows:
  d. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs a, b  and  c  of  this
 subdivision,  the  board of education or the trustee of a district and a
 contractor providing pupil transportation services to such district  may
 amend  a  contract for pupil transportation services upon a finding that
 such amendment is necessary to comply with any federal, state  or  local
 law, rule or regulation imposed after the execution of such contract, or
 to  enhance  the  safety  of  pupil transportation, as determined by the
 board or trustee subject to the approval of the commissioner pursuant to
 regulations which shall require demonstrable enhancements in pupil safe-
 ty and/or increased savings consistent with  maintaining  pupil  safety.
 Such  amendment shall cause no additional cost to the state, locality or
 school district  UNLESS SUCH AMENDMENT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLY  WITH  ANY
 FEDERAL,  STATE  OR LOCAL LAW, RULE AND PROVIDED THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTAB-
 LISHED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT THERE HAS  BEEN  AT  LEAST  AN  EQUIVALENT
 INCREASE  IN  THE  AMOUNT  OF  SUCH  CONTRACTOR'S COST OF OPERATION. The
 commissioner shall not approve such an  amendment  if  the  commissioner
 finds that it circumvents the competitive bidding requirements contained
 in  paragraph  a of this subdivision, or otherwise violates this section
 or any other provision of law, or fails  to  increase  or  maintain  the
 safety of pupil transportation.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 ration  and repeal of such paragraph and shall be deemed repealed there-
