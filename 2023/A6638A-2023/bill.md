  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide an increase in the defined benefit cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with a payment in September 2023, additional payments will  be  made
 for those members who retired after 1960 and prior to 1973.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System, pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement  and  Social
 Security  Law,  the increased costs would be borne entirely by the State
 of New York and would require an itemized  appropriation  sufficient  to
 pay  the  cost  of the provision. If enacted during the 2023 legislative
 session, the increase in the present value of benefits would be approxi-
 mately $83,800. The cost including interest that would be billed to  the
 State of New York on March 1, 2024 is $93,500.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of  New  York  and  the  participating  employers in the
 NYSLPFRS.  If enacted during the 2023 legislative session, the  increase
 in  the  present  value of benefits would be approximately $337,000. The
 estimated first year cost would be $8,500 to the State of New  York  and
 $34,000  to  the  local  participating  employers in the NYSLPFRS in the
 fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.
