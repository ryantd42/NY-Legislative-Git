  (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, no finan-
 cial  assistance  of  the  agency  shall  be  provided in respect of any
 project where facilities or property that are primarily used  in  making
 retail  sales  to customers who personally visit such facilities consti-
 tute more than one-third of the total project cost. For the purposes  of
 this  article,  "retail  sales"  shall  mean:  (i) sales by a registered
 vendor under article twenty-eight of the tax law  primarily  engaged  in
 the  retail  sale  of tangible personal property, as defined in subpara-

 VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REGION AS ESTABLISHED  BY
