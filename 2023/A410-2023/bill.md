 commercial activity; and the term "lease for a term of one year or more"
 shall not include any lease the term of which is  less  than  one  year,
 irrespective of the fact that the cumulative period for which such lease
 may be in effect is one year or more as the result of the right to exer-
 cise an option to renew or other like provision.
