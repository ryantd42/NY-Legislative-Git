  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud to commemorate the 75th
Anniversary of the Wolcottsville Volunteer Fire Company and to honor its
past and present firefighting members for 75 years of fire protection to
the  citizens  of  Wolcottsville,  New  York,  and  its  surrounding
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the  past  75
years,  the  courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of  Wolcottsville
Volunteer Fire Company have valiantly responded to  all  types  of  fire
emergencies  and  have won the praise and respect of the community which
they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a history of dedicated firefighter membership spanning
over seven decades, the Wolcottsville Volunteer Fire Company was founded
in 1947, with 66 people affixing their signatures to  a  petition  as  a
show of support for its establishment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On April 14, 1947, a meeting was called to order by Robert

were  elected: Arthur Fiegel as Chairman, Norman Schleef as Co-Chairman,
and Robert Fink as Secretary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  this  April  meeting,  two  committees  were
established  to  investigate  the  availability  of  government  surplus
equipment and the availability of other fire equipment; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 22, 1947, a meeting was held,  and  the  following
were  elected officers of the new Fire Company: Arthur Ewald, President;

  WHEREAS, During the balance of the year, the new Fire Company put on
a  Field Day, held several raffles, marched in several parades including
The Newstead World War II Veterans Association Parade, Wrights  corners,

  WHEREAS,  The  record of the Wolcottsville Volunteer Fire Company in
public service and fire protection is one to be envied; for 24  hours  a
day,  for  365  days  a  year, for 75 years, whenever the alarm sounded,
these noble volunteers left their homes and went to  the  aid  of  their
neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters  of  Wolcottsville Volunteer Fire
Company are prepared to risk their lives every  day  to  help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, Much of the ongoing successes of the Company are due to the
able leadership of Presidents and Chiefs  both  past  and  present;  the
current  President, Bill Tobin and Fire Chief, Paul Gurnett, embody such
successes and are a symbol of the resilience  and  traditions  of  these
long-standing fire companies across the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  Wolcottsville  Volunteer  Fire  Company
reflects  the  history  and development of firefighting over the past 75
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the volunteer fire  departments  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Wolcottsville Volunteer Fire
Company; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
