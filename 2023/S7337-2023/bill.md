 filing of a petition in such court within [thirty] NINETY days after the
 condemnor's completion of its publication of its determination and find-
 ings pursuant to section two hundred four [herein] OF THIS ARTICLE. Such
 petition  shall  be  accompanied  by proof of service of a demand on the
 condemnor to file with said court a copy of a written transcript of  the
 record  of the proceeding before it, and a copy of its determination and
 findings. Upon receipt of such petition and demand, the condemnor  shall

 brought in any one, but only one, of  such  departments,  and  all  such
 proceedings  with relation to any single public project shall be consol-
 idated with that first filed.  IF THE CONDEMNOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERS THE

 NEE  SHALL  HAVE AN ADDITIONAL NINETY DAYS FROM THE CONDEMNOR'S PUBLICA-
