  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow fire districts in Suffolk  County  that  partic-
 ipate  in  the  New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System to
 elect to provide individuals employed in the title of emergency  medical
 technician, advanced emergency medical technician, critical care techni-
 cian,  or  paramedic,  and  supervisors  of  these titles, the option to
 retire upon completion of twenty-five years of creditable service with a
 benefit of one-half of final average  salary  (FAS)  and  an  additional
 benefit  of  one-sixtieth  of FAS for each year of creditable service in
 excess of twenty-five years. Members in Tiers 3 -- 6 would be limited to
 15 years of additional one-sixtieths.
  Additionally, for those members covered under the provisions of  Arti-
 cle  14,  this  bill would permit an irrevocable election to forfeit the
 benefits of Article 14 in favor of the 25-year plan benefit  established
 by  this  legislation. Such election must be made within one year of the
 effective date of this bill or within one year of entering service  with
 an electing fire district, whichever comes later.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there will be an increase in the annual contributions of an
 affected fire district of approximately 5% of salary paid  to  employees
 in  covered  titles for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. In future
 years, this cost will vary as the billing rates of the affected  members
 change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately 20% of salary paid to
 employees in covered titles, which will be borne by  the  electing  fire
 A. 7613  6
 
 district  as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that payment will
 be made on February 1, 2024.
  Further,  we  anticipate  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Prior to electing to provide these benefits, an eligible  fire  district
 would be required to submit a roster of individuals in covered titles to
 the  New  York  State  and Local Retirement System. This roster would be
 used to develop an exact cost for the individual fire district  electing
 to provide these benefits.
