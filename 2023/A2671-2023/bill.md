 accordance with section one hundred thirty-one-u of this chapter and the
 regulations  of  the  office  of  children and family services, a social
 services district shall offer and provide necessary and available  emer-
 gency  shelter  and  services  for  up  to  ninety days at a residential
 program for victims  of  domestic  violence  to  a  victim  of  domestic
 violence who was residing in the social services district at the time of
 the alleged domestic violence whether or not such victim is eligible for
 public  assistance.  [Two]  THREE forty-five day extensions of necessary
 and available emergency shelter may be granted beyond the maximum length
 of stay at a residential program for victims of  domestic  violence  for

 term is defined in section one hundred twenty-three-b of the agriculture
 and  markets  law, or therapy dog as such term is defined in section one
 hundred eight of the agriculture and  markets  law,  respectively,  such
 service  animal  or therapy dog shall be allowed to accompany the victim
 at the residential program authorized pursuant to this section, so  long

  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be construed to limit any rights or
 obligations provided pursuant to federal or state law, including but not
 limited to providing  reasonable  accommodations  for  individuals  with
 disabilities.
