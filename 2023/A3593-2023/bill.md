 Introduced  by M. of A. L. ROSENTHAL, WEPRIN, SIMON, DINOWITZ, PAULIN --
  read once and referred  to  the  Committee  on  Consumer  Affairs  and
  Protection
 
 AN  ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the management
  and oversight of personal data
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York privacy act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. 1. Privacy is  a  fundamental  right  and  an
 essential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced ramp-
 ant  growth  in  the amount and categories of personal data being gener-
 ated,  collected,  stored,  analyzed,  and  potentially  shared,  which
 presents  both  promise  and peril. Companies collect, use and share our
 personal data in ways that can be difficult for  ordinary  consumers  to
 understand. Opaque data processing policies make it impossible to evalu-
 ate  risks  and  compare  privacy-related  protections  across services,
 stifling competition. Algorithms quietly make  decisions  with  critical
 consequences for New York consumers, often with no human accountability.
 Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning people into products
 and  their  activity into assets. New York consumers deserve more notice
 and more control over their data and their digital privacy.
  2. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy.  It
 gives New York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their
 personal data and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and
 accountable managers of that information.  To  achieve  this,  this  act
 provides  New  York  consumers  a  number of new rights, including clear
 notice of how their data is being used, processed and shared; the abili-
 ty to access and obtain a copy of their data in a  commonly  used  elec-
 tronic  format,  with  the  ability to transfer it between services; the
 ability to correct inaccurate data and to delete  their  data;  and  the

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 ability  to challenge certain automated decisions. This act also imposes
 obligations upon businesses to maintain  reasonable  data  security  for
 personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable harms arising
 from  use of their data and to obtain specific consent for that use, and
 to conduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not being used for
 unacceptable purposes. These data assessments can be obtained and evalu-
 ated by the New York State Attorney General, who is empowered to  obtain
 penalties for violations of this act and prevent future violations. This
 act  also  grants New York consumers who have been injured as the result
 of a violation a private right  of  action,  which  includes  reasonable
 attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff.
  § 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42 to
 read as follows:

 CONTROLLER SHALL:
  (A) CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THE CONTROLLER IS PROCESSING OR  HAS  PROC-

 PARTIES THEY DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA TO.
  (D)  IF  THE  INVESTIGATION DOES NOT RESOLVE THE DISPUTE, THE CONSUMER
 MAY FILE WITH THE CONTROLLER A BRIEF STATEMENT SETTING FORTH THE  NATURE

 THE CONTROLLER MUST NOTE THAT IT IS DISPUTED BY THE CONSUMER AND INCLUDE
 EITHER THE CONSUMER'S STATEMENT OR A CLEAR AND ACCURATE CODIFICATION  OR
 SUMMARY  THEREOF  WITH  THE  DISPUTED  PERSONAL  DATA  WHENEVER  IT  IS

 THE CONSUMER OF ANY SUCH EXTENSION WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS OF RECEIPT  OF

 ASSISTING OTHERS IN AUTOMATED  DECISION-MAKING  IN  THOSE  FIELDS,  MUST
 ANNUALLY  CONDUCT AN IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF SUCH AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
 THAT:
  (A) DESCRIBES AND EVALUATES THE  OBJECTIVES  AND  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE

 DISCRIMINATORY  RESULTS ON THE BASIS OF A CONSUMER'S OR CLASS OF CONSUM-
 ERS' ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED  RACE,  COLOR,  ETHNICITY,  RELIGION,  NATIONAL
 ORIGIN,  SEX,  GENDER,  GENDER  IDENTITY,  SEXUAL  ORIENTATION, FAMILIAL

 DENIAL.
  (B) A CONTROLLER SHALL PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AND CARRY OUT ITS

 BECAUSE OF THEIR REPETITIVE CHARACTER, THE  CONTROLLER  MAY  EITHER  (I)
 CHARGE  A  REASONABLE FEE TO COVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF COMPLYING
 WITH THE REQUEST OR (II) REFUSE TO ACT ON THE  REQUEST  AND  NOTIFY  THE

 LAWFULLY EXERCISING THE RIGHT ON BEHALF  OF  THE  CONSUMER  WHO  IS  THE
 SUBJECT OF THE DATA. COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS SHALL BE DETERMINED
 BASED  ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE
 DATA IMPLICATED BY THE REQUEST.
  (II) A CONTROLLER MAY  REQUIRE  THE  CONSUMER  TO  PROVIDE  ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION  ONLY  IF  THE REQUEST CANNOT REASONABLY BE VERIFIED WITHOUT
 THE PROVISION OF SUCH ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.  A  CONTROLLER  MUST  NOT
 TRANSFER OR PROCESS ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED PURSUANT TO
 THIS  SECTION  FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AND MUST DELETE ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY AND IN ANY EVENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE  DAYS

 PROCESSOR OR THIRD  PARTY  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  VERIFYING  A  CONSUMER
 REQUEST,  IT  MUST  NOTIFY THE RECEIVING PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY AT THE
 TIME OF SUCH DISCLOSURE, OR AS CLOSE IN TIME TO  THE  DISCLOSURE  AS  IS
 REASONABLY  PRACTICABLE,  THAT  SUCH  INFORMATION  WAS  PROVIDED  BY THE
 CONSUMER FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF VERIFICATION AND  CANNOT  BE  PROCESSED
 FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN VERIFICATION.
  9.  IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS. CONTROLLERS MUST PROVIDE EASILY ACCESSI-
 BLE AND CONVENIENT MEANS FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE  THEIR  RIGHTS  UNDER
 THIS ARTICLE.
  10.  NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS. ANY PROVISION OF A CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT OF
 ANY KIND THAT PURPORTS TO WAIVE OR LIMIT IN ANY WAY A CONSUMER'S  RIGHTS
 A. 3593  13

 UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE  IS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND IS VOID AND UNEN-
 FORCEABLE.
  §  1103.  CONTROLLER, PROCESSOR, AND THIRD PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES. 1.
 CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES. (A) DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT. A  CONTROL-
 LER  SHALL  REGULARLY  CONDUCT AND DOCUMENT A DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT
 FOR PROCESSING ACTIVITIES THAT PRESENT A HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM TO  THE
 CONSUMER.  SUCH ASSESSMENT MUST IDENTIFY AND WEIGH THE BENEFITS THAT MAY
 FLOW, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PROCESSING  TO  THE  CONTROLLER,
 THE  CONSUMER,  OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE POTENTIAL
 RISKS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER, OR CLASS OF  CONSUMERS,  ASSOCIATED
 WITH  THE PROCESSING, AS MITIGATED BY SAFEGUARDS THAT THE CONTROLLER CAN
 EMPLOY TO REDUCE THE  RISKS.  THE  CONTROLLER  SHALL  FACTOR  INTO  THIS
 ASSESSMENT  THE USE OF DEIDENTIFIED DATA AND THE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS
 OF CONSUMERS, AS WELL AS THE CONTEXT OF THE PROCESSING AND THE RELATION-
 SHIP BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND THE CONSUMER WHOSE PERSONAL DATA WILL BE
 PROCESSED, WITH THE GOAL OF RESTRICTING OR PROHIBITING  SUCH  PROCESSING

 CONSUMERS OR A CLASS OF CONSUMERS;
  (B)  FINANCIAL,  PHYSICAL,  PSYCHOLOGICAL  OR  REPUTATIONAL  INJURY TO
 CONSUMERS, OR A CLASS OF CONSUMERS;
  (C) A PHYSICAL OR OTHERWISE INTRUSION UPON THE SOLITUDE OR  SECLUSION,
 OR  THE  PRIVATE AFFAIRS OR CONCERNS, OF CONSUMERS, WHERE SUCH INTRUSION
 WOULD BE OFFENSIVE TO A REASONABLE PERSON; OR
  (D) OTHER SUBSTANTIAL INJURY TO CONSUMERS.
  (B) DUTY OF LOYALTY. (I) A CONTROLLER MUST  NOTIFY  THE  CONSUMER,  OR
 CLASS  OF  CONSUMERS,  OF  THE INTEREST THAT MAY BE HARMED IN ADVANCE OF
 REQUESTING CONSENT AND AS CLOSE IN TIME TO THE PROCESSING AS PRACTICABLE
 WHERE IT IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE TO  THE  CONTROLLER  THAT  A  PROCESS
 PRESENTS  A  HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM TO THE CONSUMER OR CLASS OF CONSUM-
 ERS.
  (II) CONTROLLERS MUST NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS
 OR PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO OBTAINING CONSUMER CONSENT, THE  PROCESSING
 OF  PERSONAL  DATA,  AND  A CONSUMER'S EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION:
  (A) DESIGNING A USER INTERFACE WITH THE PURPOSE OR SUBSTANTIAL  EFFECT
 OF  DECEIVING CONSUMERS, OBSCURING CONSUMERS' RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE,
 OR SUBVERTING OR IMPAIRING USER AUTONOMY, DECISION-MAKING, OR CHOICE  IN
 ORDER TO OBTAIN CONSENT; OR

 BASIS,  CONDUCT  AND DOCUMENT RISK ASSESSMENTS OF ALL CURRENT PROCESSING
 OF PERSONAL DATA.

  (I) THE NATURE, SENSITIVITY AND CONTEXT OF THE PERSONAL DATA THAT  THE
 CONTROLLER PROCESSES;
  (II) THE NATURE, PURPOSE, AND VALUE OF THE PROCESSES;
  (III)  ANY RISKS OR HARMS TO CONSUMERS ACTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY ARISING
 OUT OF THE PROCESSES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL, FINANCIAL,  PSYCHOLOGICAL,  OR
 REPUTATIONAL HARMS;
  (IV) THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECT OF SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED BY THE CONTROL-
 LERS;
  (V)  THE  SUFFICIENCY  OF  THE  CONTROLLER'S  NOTICES  TO CONSUMERS AT
 DESCRIBING AND OBTAINING CONSENT CONCERNING THE PROCESSES; AND
  (VI) THE ADEQUACY  OF  THE  SAFEGUARDS  AND  MONITORING  PRACTICES  OF
 PROCESSORS  AND  THIRD  PARTIES  TO  WHOM  THE  CONTROLLER  HAS PROVIDED
 PERSONAL DATA.
  (C) THE CONTROLLER MUST RETAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR AT LEAST SIX YEARS
 AND MAKE  RISK  ASSESSMENTS  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  UPON
 REQUEST.

 SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE SECURITY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE
 PERSONAL DATA OF CONSUMERS INCLUDING ADOPTING REASONABLE ADMINISTRATIVE,
 TECHNICAL AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS APPROPRIATE TO THE VOLUME  AND  NATURE
 OF THE PERSONAL DATA AT ISSUE.
  (III)  (A) A CONTROLLER SHALL LIMIT THE USE AND RETENTION OF A CONSUM-
 ER'S PERSONAL DATA TO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE  A  SERVICE  OR  GOOD
 REQUESTED  BY  A  CONSUMER  OR  FOR  PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE CONSUMER HAS
 PROVIDED  FREELY  GIVEN,  SPECIFIC,  INFORMED,  AND  UNAMBIGUOUS  OPT-IN
 CONSENT.

 SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR (III) NECESSARY TO COMPLY
 WITH THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONTROLLER.
  (IV)  CONTROLLERS  SHALL BE UNDER A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO ENGAGE IN
 REASONABLE MEASURES TO REVIEW THEIR ACTIVITIES  FOR  CIRCUMSTANCES  THAT
 MAY HAVE ALTERED THEIR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC NATURAL PERSON AND
 TO  UPDATE  THEIR  CLASSIFICATIONS OF DATA AS IDENTIFIED OR IDENTIFIABLE
 ACCORDINGLY.
  (D) NON-DISCRIMINATION. (I) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
 A CONSUMER FOR EXERCISING RIGHTS  UNDER  THIS  ACT,  INCLUDING  BUT  NOT
 LIMITED TO, BY:

 RATE FOR SERVICES OR GOODS OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR QUALITY  OF  SERVICES
 OR GOODS.
  (II)  THIS  PARAGRAPH  DOES  NOT  APPLY TO A CONTROLLER'S CONDUCT WITH
 RESPECT TO OPT-IN CONSENT, IN WHICH CASE PARAGRAPH  (J)  OF  SUBDIVISION
 TWO OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE GOVERNS.
  (E)  AGREEMENTS  WITH  PROCESSORS.  (I)  BEFORE MAKING ANY DISCLOSURE,
 TRANSFER, OR SALE OF PERSONAL DATA TO ANY PROCESSOR, THE CONTROLLER MUST
 ENTER INTO A WRITTEN, SIGNED CONTRACT WITH THAT PROCESSOR. SUCH CONTRACT
 A. 3593  15
 
 MUST BE BINDING AND CLEARLY SET FORTH INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING  DATA,
 THE  NATURE AND PURPOSE OF PROCESSING, THE TYPE OF DATA SUBJECT TO PROC-
 ESSING, THE DURATION OF PROCESSING, AND THE RIGHTS  AND  OBLIGATIONS  OF
 BOTH  PARTIES.  THE  CONTRACT  MUST  ALSO  INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE
 PROCESSOR MUST:
  (A) ENSURE THAT EACH PERSON PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA IS SUBJECT  TO  A
 DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA;
  (B)  PROTECT  THE DATA IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF
 THIS ACT AND AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTROL-
 LER SET FORTH IN THEIR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE POLICIES, NOTICES, OR  SIMILAR
 STATEMENTS;
  (C)  PROCESS  THE DATA ONLY WHEN AND TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO COMPLY
 WITH ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE CONTROLLER UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPLICITLY
 AUTHORIZED BY THE CONTROLLER;
  (D) NOT COMBINE THE PERSONAL DATA WHICH THE PROCESSOR RECEIVES FROM OR
 ON BEHALF OF THE CONTROLLER  WITH  PERSONAL  DATA  WHICH  THE  PROCESSOR
 RECEIVES  FROM  OR  ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR COLLECTS FROM ITS OWN
 INTERACTION WITH CONSUMERS;
  (E) COMPLY WITH ANY EXERCISES OF A  CONSUMER'S  RIGHTS  UNDER  SECTION
 ELEVEN  HUNDRED  TWO OF THIS ARTICLE UPON THE REQUEST OF THE CONTROLLER,

 REQUIRED BY CLAUSE (A) OF  SUBPARAGRAPH  (I)  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH  OR  A
 VIOLATION  OF THIS ACT. ANY PROVISION OF AN AGREEMENT THAT VIOLATES THIS
 SUBPARAGRAPH IS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE.
  (III) NOTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH RELIEVES A CONTROLLER OR  A  PROCESSOR
 FROM THE LIABILITIES IMPOSED ON IT BY VIRTUE OF ITS ROLE IN THE PROCESS-

  (IV) DETERMINING WHETHER A PERSON IS ACTING AS A CONTROLLER OR PROCES-
 SOR WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF DATA IS A FACT-BASED DETER-
 A. 3593  16
 
 MINATION  THAT  DEPENDS UPON THE CONTEXT IN WHICH PERSONAL DATA IS TO BE
 PROCESSED. A PROCESSOR  THAT  CONTINUES  TO  ADHERE  TO  A  CONTROLLER'S
 INSTRUCTIONS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  A  SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
 REMAINS A PROCESSOR.
  (F)  THIRD  PARTIES. (I) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT SHARE, DISCLOSE, TRANS-
 FER, OR SELL PERSONAL DATA, OR  FACILITATE  OR  ENABLE  THE  PROCESSING,
 DISCLOSURE,  TRANSFER,  OR  SALE  OF  PERSONAL DATA TO A THIRD PARTY FOR

 PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE THIRD PARTY MAY USE THE PERSONAL DATA.
  (II) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT SHARE, DISCLOSE, TRANSFER, OR SELL PERSONAL

 CONSUMER  TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES THAT THE CONSUMER HAS NOT CONSENTED TO
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS  ARTI-
 CLE,  OR  IF  IT  CAN  REASONABLY EXPECT THAT ANY RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER
 PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE WOULD BE COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRANS-
 ACTION.
  (III) BEFORE MAKING ANY DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER, OR SALE OF PERSONAL DATA
 TO ANY THIRD PARTY, THE CONTROLLER MUST ENTER  INTO  A  WRITTEN,  SIGNED
