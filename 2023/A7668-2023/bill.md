  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation (see Appendix) would amend
 certain death benefit provisions to ensure continued compliance with the
 requirements of the  Federal  Older  Workers'  Benefit  Protection  Act,
 A. 7668  5
 
 Public  Law  101-433  (OWBPA).  In general, with respect to the New York
 City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS), the New York City  Teachers'
 Retirement  System  (NYCTRS),  and  the New York City Board of Education
 Retirement  System  (BERS),  the bill would amend the Tier 2, 3, and 4/6
 ordinary death benefit provisions set forth  in  Retirement  and  Social
 Security  Law  (RSSL)  Articles  11, 14, and 15, respectively, to ensure
 that, on an actuarial basis, the costs of  providing  such  benefits  to
 older  members  are no less than the costs of providing such benefits to
 younger members.
  Effective Date: This bill would be effective immediately and be deemed
 to have been in force since July 1, 2021.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Under the proposed legislation,  if  enacted,  the
 Pre-retirement  Ordinary  Death  Benefit  for Active and Deferred Vested
 Members, and the Post-retirement Death Benefit for Tier 2,  3,  and  4/6
 NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS members, would be updated.
  PRE-RETIREMENT ORDINARY DEATH BENEFIT
  The  Tier  2, 3 and 4/6 Ordinary Death Benefit (for all members except
 police officers, firefighters, correction officers, or sanitation  work-
 ers)  is a lump sum payment equal to current pay multiplied by completed
 years of service (up to three years) and further reduced by a percentage
 based on age at date of death.
  Currently, the reduction is 0% for ages 60 and younger, and  increases
 by  5% for every age over 60, up to the ultimate rate of 50% for ages 70
 and older.
  Under the proposed legislation the reduction would remain 0% for  ages
 60  and  younger, and increase by 3% for every age over age 60 up to the
 ultimate reduction of 30% for ages 70 and older.
  POST-RETIREMENT DEATH BENEFIT
  The changes to the reductions described above would also apply to  the
 calculation of the post-retirement death benefit. In addition, the post-
 retirement  death benefit in the third year of retirement and thereafter
 would be changed as follows:
  Current provision: 10% of the Pre-retirement death benefit that  would
 have  been  payable  had  the  member died on the earlier of (1) the day
 before they retired and (2) age 60.
  Proposed provision: Greater of the benefit payable under  the  current
 provision  and  10% of the death benefit payable had the member died the
 day before they retired.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT: The increase in annual employer contributions  asso-
 ciated  with  this  proposed  legislation has already been accounted for
 beginning with the June 30, 2020 actuarial valuations used to  determine
 the Final Fiscal Year 2022 employer contributions of NYCERS, NYCTRS, and
 BERS.
  The  estimated financial impact of updating ordinary death benefits to
 maintain compliance with OWBPA as described  above  is  an  increase  in
 Present Value of Future Benefits of approximately $223.7 million, and an
 initial increase in the FY 2022 annual employer contributions of approx-
 imately $40.0 million ($26.8 million for New York City and $13.2 million
 for  the other obligors). A breakdown of the FY 2022 annual contribution
 impact by System is shown in the table below.
  Impact on FY 2022
  System  Annual Employer Contributions
  ______
  ($ Millions)
  _____________________________
  NYCERS  $ 22.9
 A. 7668  6
 
  NYCTRS  12.5
  BERS  4.6
  Total  $ 40.0
  Long-term annual costs (after the initial increase in unfunded accrued
 liability  is  fully amortized in seven to eight years) are estimated to
 be less than $10 million for all three Systems combined.
  New Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to  benefit  changes
 are  generally  amortized  over  the remaining working lifetime of those
 impacted by the benefit changes. For purposes of this  Fiscal  Note,  it
 had  been  assumed that increases in UAL would be amortized over periods
 ranging from seven to eight years depending on the System (six to  seven
 payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level  dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2020 actuarial valuations of NYCERS, NYCTRS,
 and BERS to determine the Fiscal Year 2022 employer contributions.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Fiscal Year 2022 employer contributions of NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: I, Marek  Tyszkiewicz,  am  the  Chief
 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but

  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note  2023-55  dated  May  22,
 2023  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Employees'
 Retirement System, the New York City Teachers'  Retirement  System,  and
 the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. This estimate is
 intended for use only during the 2023 Legislative Session.
