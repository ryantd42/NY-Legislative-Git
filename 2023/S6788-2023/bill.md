 AN ACT granting retroactive membership in the New York state  and  local
  employees' retirement system to Justin Whitmore
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of  law,  Justin  Whit-
 more,  a  member of the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retire-
 ment System currently  employed  by  the  city  of  Rochester,  who  was
 employed  as  a  seasonal  employee for Sampson State Park, beginning on
 July 7, 2007, who through no fault of his own, failed to become a member
 of the New York state and local employees' retirement system during such
 employment by Sampson State Park in 2007, shall be deemed to have joined
 the New York state and local employees' retirement system  on  the  date
 July  7,  2007  and  shall  be granted Tier IV status in such retirement
 system, if, within one year of the effective date of this act, he  shall
 file a written request with the state comptroller.
  § 2. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the state of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide  Justin R. Whitmore a date of membership of
 July 7, 2007 resulting in Tier 2 status in the New York State and  Local
 Police and Fire Retirement System. The member is currently in Tier 6 and
 is employed by the City of Rochester.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $10,000 in the
 annual contributions of the City of Rochester for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of Justin R. Whitmore change.

  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $42,500 which will be
 borne by the State of New York as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
