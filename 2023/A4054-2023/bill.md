 PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO  THE  CONTRARY,  THE
 AUTHORITY  SHALL  REPAIR  OR CAUSE TO BE REPAIRED ANY CONDITIONS THAT IT

 TEN  NOTICE  OF  SUCH CONDITIONS IN NEED OF REPAIRS. SUCH WRITTEN NOTICE
 SHALL BE PROVIDED TO THE PROPERTY MANAGER IN A  MANNER  CONSISTENT  WITH

 THE  PROPERTY MANAGER OF THE PROJECT WHEREIN SUCH TENANT RESIDES OF SUCH
 TENANT'S  INTENT  TO  REPAIR  SUCH CONDITIONS. SUCH TENANT SHALL KEEP AN
 ACCURATE RECORD OF EXPENSES INCURRED BY REPAIRING  SUCH  CONDITIONS  AND
 SHALL  EITHER:  (A)  BE  ENTITLED  TO PAYMENT FROM THE AUTHORITY OF SUCH
 AMOUNT, WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF NOTICE TO THE AUTHORITY OF SUCH  EXPENSES
 INCURRED, OR (B) BE ENTITLED TO DEDUCT SUCH AMOUNT FROM FUTURE RENT OWED
