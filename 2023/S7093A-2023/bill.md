 for buildings of public libraries that are located  in  an  economically
 disadvantaged  community  [and  that state aid may be provided for up to
 ninety percent of the total project  approved  costs  for  buildings  of
 public libraries that are located in an economically distressed communi-
 ty].  Provided however that the state liability for aid paid pursuant to
 this section shall be limited to funds appropriated  for  such  purpose.
 Aid  shall  be  provided on approved expenses incurred during the period
 commencing July first and ending June thirtieth for up to six years,  or
 until the project is completed, whichever occurs first. Provided, howev-
 er,  that  public  libraries  that received aid for projects pursuant to
 this section commencing July first, two thousand seventeen through  July
 first,  two  thousand  nineteen and are unable to complete such projects
 due to the state disaster emergency declared pursuant to executive order
 number two hundred two of two thousand  twenty,  as  amended,  shall  be
 provided an additional twelve months from the statutory project end date
 to  complete  such projects.  Fifty percent of such aid shall be payable
 to each system or library  upon  approval  of  the  application  by  the
 department. Forty percent of such aid shall be payable in the next state
 fiscal  year.  The  remaining  ten percent shall be payable upon project
 completion.
  2. Each SINGLE BUILDING PROJECT application for  state  aid  shall  be
 submitted  by  the  board  of  trustees of the library or library system
 responsible for the operation of the subject building to the commission-
 er for [his or her] THE COMMISSIONER'S review and approval, after having
 been reviewed and approved by the governing board of the public  library
 system  of  which such library is a member. Each SINGLE BUILDING PROJECT
 application shall:
  a. demonstrate that resources are or shall be available to provide for
 maximum utilization of the project if approved;
  b. contain verification in such form  as  may  be  acceptable  to  the
 commissioner that the total cost of the project, exclusive of state aid,
 has been or will be obtained;
  c.  demonstrate  that library operations would be made more economical
 as a consequence of approval;
  d. be limited to one project concerning such building,  provided  that
 no  building  shall  be  the  subject  of  more than one SINGLE BUILDING
 PROJECT application per year;
  e. contain documentation, where such an application requests state aid
 in an amount greater than [fifty]  SEVENTY-FIVE  percent,  demonstrating
 how  the  project  will address the service needs of one or more econom-
 ically disadvantaged communities.  Such  documentation  may  demonstrate
 need through poverty rates, concentrations of English language learners,
 low high school graduation rates, limited fiscal capacity or other rele-
 vant factors; AND
  f.  [contain  documentation,  where such an application requests state
 aid in an amount greater than seventy-five  percent,  demonstrating  how
 the  project  will address the service needs of one or more economically
 distressed communities. An application must demonstrate that the average
 poverty rate within the library's service area is equal  to  or  greater
 than  the New York state average poverty rate using federal census data;
 and the library must demonstrate that it lacks the capacity  to  provide
 twenty-five percent of the project costs; and
  g.]  provide  such other information as may be required by the commis-
 sioner.
