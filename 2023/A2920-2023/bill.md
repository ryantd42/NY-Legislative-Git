  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The vehicle and traffic law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 404-ff to read as follows:
  §  404-FF.  DISTINCTIVE  PLATES  FOR MEMBERS OF THE SEABEE VETERANS OF
 AMERICA. 1. ANY MEMBER OF THE SEABEE VETERANS  OF  AMERICA  RESIDING  IN
 THIS  STATE  SHALL,  UPON REQUEST, BE ISSUED A LICENSE PLATE BEARING THE
 NAVY SEABEE EMBLEM. APPLICATION FOR SAID LICENSE PLATE  SHALL  BE  FILED
 WITH  THE COMMISSIONER IN SUCH FORM AND DETAIL AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 PRESCRIBE.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED IN THIS SECTION  SHALL  BE  ISSUED
 UPON  PROOF,  SATISFACTORY  TO THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE APPLICANT IS A
 MEMBER OF THE SEABEE VETERANS OF AMERICA.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED
 IN THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER NUMBER PLATES UPON THE PAYMENT OF THE  REGU-
 LAR  REGISTRATION  FEE  PRESCRIBED  BY  SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS
 ARTICLE, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT AN ADDITIONAL ONE-TIME  SERVICE  CHARGE
 OF TEN DOLLARS SHALL BE CHARGED FOR SUCH PLATE.
  § 2. Subdivision 1-a of section 404 of the vehicle and traffic law, as

  1-a.  The  commissioner  may issue special number plates to applicants
 who are members of veterans organizations in the same  manner  as  other
 number  plates  are issued pursuant to this article. Such special number
 plates shall be issued only upon  (a)  payment  of  a  one-time  service
 charge  of  ten  dollars  in  addition  to  the regular registration fee
 prescribed by  section  four  hundred  one  of  this  article,  and  (b)

 submission  of  proof, satisfactory to the commissioner, that the appli-
 cant is presently a member of the veterans organization for  which  such
 plate  is  requested.  Such membership shall be verified annually by the
 applicant.  Application for such plates shall be made in accordance with
 regulations promulgated by the commissioner with respect to the issuance
 of such plates. Provided, however, that nothing contained  herein  shall
 be  deemed  to  supersede the provisions of section four hundred four-d,
 four hundred four-e, four hundred  four-h,  four  hundred  four-i,  four
 hundred  four-j,  four hundred four-k, four hundred four-p, four hundred
 four-aa, [or] four hundred four-dd OR FOUR HUNDRED FOUR-FF of this arti-
 cle.
  § 3. 1. A distinctive plate established pursuant to section 404-ff  of
 the  vehicle  and  traffic law as added by section one of this act shall
 only be designed, produced and issued upon the delivery to  the  depart-
 ment  of  motor  vehicles of a surety bond in the amount of six thousand
 dollars, which shall be executed by a surety company authorized  by  the
 department  of  financial  services  to transact business in this state.
 Provided, however, that if the commissioner of motor vehicles shall have
 received prior to plate design, production and  issuance  at  least  two
 hundred  orders  for such distinctive plate together with the additional
 one-time service charge applicable to each such order,  which  shall  be
 non-refundable,  no  such  surety  bond  shall  be required. All service
 charges collected pursuant to this section shall be  deposited  pursuant
 to  the  provisions  of section 404-oo of the vehicle and traffic law to
 the credit of the department of motor vehicles distinctive plate  devel-
 opment  fund  established  by  section 95-g of the state finance law and
 shall be used for the design, production, advertising  and  distribution
 of distinctive license plates in accordance with such section 95-g.
  2.  If, upon the expiration of two years following the date upon which
 distinctive plates in the  series  are  first  available  for  sale  two
 hundred  or more sets of such plates are sold, a bond delivered pursuant
 to this section shall be discontinued. If fewer than two hundred sets of
 such plates are sold by such time, such department shall be entitled  to
 recover against the bond in an amount proportionate to such shortfall.
  §  4.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 section one of this act shall take effect on the one  hundred  eightieth
 day  after  it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addi-
 tion, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  necessary  for
 the  implementation  of this act on its effective date are authorized to
 be made and completed on or before such effective date.
