  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 6, 2022, as Alcohol Screening Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2022, as Alcohol
Screening Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Alcohol Screening Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Alcohol  Screening Day (NASD) was established in
1999 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to raise awareness about
alcohol misuse and referrals to treatment for individuals  with  alcohol
problems through outreach, education and screening programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  NASD  is  held each year on the Thursday of the first full
week in April; thousands of colleges, community-based organizations, and
military  installations  offer  anonymous  and  confidential  screenings
online or in-person at public events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  this  day,  the people who visit the screening
centers are dealt with on a case  by  case  basis;  they  are  asked  to
complete  a  written self-assessment about their alcohol use, and health
care professionals at the centers then tailor advice to that individual;
and
 
  WHEREAS, On the first screening day in 1999, 50,000  people  visited
the  1,500  screening centers throughout the United States for advice; a
higher than expected number of college students attended; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alcohol abuse can be high in college students, who,  whilst
typically  not  dependent  on  alcohol,  abuse it by frequently drinking
large volumes; excessive, often rapid, consumption of  alcohol  is  also
known as binge drinking; and
 
  WHEREAS, In a follow up study of Alcohol Screening Day, it was found
that  44%  of  college  students  interviewed  had  consumed  over  four
alcoholic drinks in a drinking session, on one or more occasions  within
30 days; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alcohol  abuse can lead to many recognized health problems
which can include anxiety, depression or sexual problems; where  alcohol
abuse  occurs  over  a longer period of time, there is increased risk of
developing certain cancers, liver cirrhosis,  high  blood  pressure  and
heart problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is essential that there be greater public awareness of
the benefits of alcohol screening, and all New Yorkers are urged to seek
 
professional help if  they  are  struggling  with  alcohol  abuse;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2022, as  Alcohol
Screening Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
