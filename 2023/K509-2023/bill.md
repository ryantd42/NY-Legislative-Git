  COMMEMORATING the 25th Anniversary of the Endicott
  Performing Arts Center on September 23, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute  to  those  cultural  institutions  and  organizations  whose
commitment  to  promoting  the  richness  and  diversity of the arts and
entertainment world has  contributed  to  the  strength,  vitality,  and
cultural  enrichment  of  their  communities  and the great State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Endicott Performing Arts Center,
to be celebrated with a Silver Jubilee  featuring  performers  from  the
past  25  years, as well as a post-show reception on Saturday, September
23, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Endicott Performing Arts Center (EPAC) is a  non-profit
organization  which  provides  an  affordable  and high quality venue to
local,  regional  and  touring  performing  artists,  enabling  them  to
present, develop, and improve their artistic efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  remaining  true to its mission, the Endicott
Performing Arts Center provides  a  means  for  thousands  of  community
members  to  gain  education  about  all aspects of the performing arts,
while presenting a diverse  array  of  performing  arts  events  to  its
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1998, the Endicott Performing Arts Center was bought by
three Endicott natives, Bob Corwin,  Patty  Daglio,  and  Steve  Daglio;
during  this  time,  Pat  Foti  and  Lou  Ligouri headed the restoration
project, and later in 2010, the name was changed to the  "Robert  Eckert
Theatre" in honor of another Endicott native who was active in community
theater; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the past 25 years, EPAC has renovated and operated out
of  the  106-year-old  "Lyric Theater" on Washington Avenue in Endicott,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the COVID Pandemic, which caused EPAC  to  shut  its
doors  for the first time in over 20 years, the Endicott Performing Arts
Center was able to reinvent itself by creating a  new  online  platform,
EPAC DIGITAL, which enables EPAC to continue its mission while expanding
its  audience;  this  new  video  streaming system allows audiences from
around the world to experience EPAC  productions  from  the  comfort  of
their own homes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  under  the  direction  of  its  President,  Andrea
Gregori, this extraordinary cultural institution serves as  the  premier
entertainment  center  in  Broome County, and a true beacon for the arts
which are so vital to the community and the lives of its  residents  and
visitors; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vibrant arts community encourages collaboration, instills
local  pride,  draws  people together, and is essential to a community's
vitality; since its inception,  EPAC  has  greatly  contributed  to  the
richness  of  New  York's  cultural  palette  and  remains  steadfastly
dedicated  to  ensuring this gem remains in all its glory for decades to
come; and
 
  WHEREAS, The arts are the building blocks of civilization; they  are
central  to  human  expression;  they  enlighten  us  and  inspire  the
imagination; educational institutions,  individuals,  and  organizations
which  further  such  worthy  purposes  richly merit the recognition and
appreciation of this Legislative Body and the people of the State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the historic Endicott Performing Arts Center looks  back
with great pride to its beginnings, viewing, with just satisfaction, its
successful  evolution,  it  renews  both  its  dedication  to supporting
artistic excellence, and its commitment to the community it  has  served
since  1998, expressing its appreciation to all those who have helped to
sustain and enhance it over the years; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 25th Anniversary of the Endicott Performing Arts Center
on September 23, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Andrea Gregori, President of the Endicott Performing Arts
Center.
