  referred to the Committee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to the design of  uniform
  standards and conditions relating to the construction and operation of
  major  renewable  energy facilities and the review of applications for
  permits to develop such facilities; and  requires  the  office  of
  renewable  energy  siting to establish or amend rules and regulations
  pertaining  to renewable energy siting facilities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 3 of section 94-c of the exec-

 practicable, any potential  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts
 AND,  TO  THE  MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE, AVOID, MINIMIZE, AND MITIGATE
 AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS TO ACTIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDS related to the siting,
 design, construction and operation of a major renewable energy facility.
 Such uniform standards and conditions shall apply to those environmental
 impacts the office determines are common to each type of major renewable
 energy facility.
  § 2. Paragraphs (e), (f), (g),  (h),  and  (i)  of  subdivision  3  of
 section  94-c  of  the executive law are relettered paragraphs (f), (g),
 (h), (i), and (j) and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows:
  (E) IN ITS REVIEW OF AN APPLICATION FOR A PERMIT TO  DEVELOP  A  MAJOR
 RENEWABLE  ENERGY FACILITY, THE OFFICE, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPART-
 MENT OF AGRICULTURE AND MARKETS SHALL ENSURE THAT  A  CRITICAL  MASS  OF
 FARMLAND  WITHIN  THE DESIGNATED REGION IS NOT THREATENED, ENSURING THAT
 NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF PRIME  SOILS  WITHIN  A  REGIONAL  ECONOMIC
 DEVELOPMENT  COUNCIL  REGION  SHALL HAVE SOLAR DEVELOPED AND ENSURE THAT

 SOLAR DEVELOPMENT SHALL NOT GREATLY HINDER THE AMOUNT OF FARMLAND WITHIN
 NEW YORK STATE AND/OR BE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO NEW YORK'S FOOD SECURITY.
  §  3.  Section  94-c  of  the executive law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 9 to read as follows:
  9. RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE OFFICE SHALL ESTABLISH AND/OR AMEND THE
 RULES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO SUCH OFFICE TO INCLUDE  THE  FOLLOW-
 ING:
  (A)  THE DEFINITION OF PRIME FARMLAND AS DEFINED IN PART 622.04 OF THE
 USDA HANDBOOK AND THE DEFINITIONS OF UNIQUE FARMLAND,  SPECIFIC  CHARAC-
 TERISTICS  OF  UNIQUE  FARMLAND, ADDITIONAL FARMLAND OF STATEWIDE IMPOR-
 TANCE, AND ADDITIONAL FARMLAND OF LOCAL IMPORTANCE  AS  SUCH  TERMS  ARE
 DEFINED IN 7 CFR § 657.5.
  (B)(I) PREAPPLICATION PROCEDURES WHICH REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO:
  (1) SUBMIT A REPORT DELINEATING THE IMPACTS TO PRIME AGRICULTURAL LAND
 AND  PRIME  SOILS,  UNIQUE  FARMLAND AND FARMLAND OF STATEWIDE AND LOCAL
 IMPORTANCE, INCLUDING SOIL CLASSIFICATIONS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATURAL
 RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE;
  (2) SUBMIT A CUMULATIVE IMPACT STUDY AS TO HOW THE USE OF FARMLAND FOR
 SOLAR SITING WILL IMPACT THE REGIONAL FOOD ECONOMY AND REGIONAL  OVERALL
 FARMLAND PROTECTION PLAN; AND
  (3)  ENSURE  THAT  A  CRITICAL  MASS OF FARMLAND WITHIN THE DESIGNATED
 REGION IS NOT THREATENED, ENSURING THAT NO MORE  THAN  FIVE  PERCENT  OF
 PRIME SOILS ARE BEING SITED WITHIN A REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUN-
 CIL REGION; AND
  (II) PREFERENCE TO BE GIVEN TO SITES FOR SOLAR DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE ON
 BROWNFIELDS,  LANDFILLS,  PARKING  LOTS, ROOFTOPS, GRAVEL PITS AND OTHER
 AREAS WHERE DISTURBANCE TO LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS  IS  MINIMIZED.  SUCH  SITES
 SHALL BE GRANTED EXPEDITED APPROVAL.
  (C)  APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR MAJOR RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITY SITING
 PERMITS.  EACH APPLICATION FOR SUCH PERMIT SHALL REQUIRE:
  (I) THE SUBMISSION OF A CUMULATIVE IMPACT STATEMENT WITHIN  THE  STUDY
 AREA WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
  (1) CATEGORIES BASED ON SOLAR ARRAY SIZE, SPECIFYING THE ARRAY CAPACI-
 TY  AND  HOW  MUCH  POWER  OR  ELECTRICITY  IS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED,
 ON-SITE OR ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC LOAD, AND THE LAND USE FOOTPRINT, INCLUD-
 ING THE ACREAGE OF LAND UNDERLYING THE ARRAY;
  (2) CUSTOMER TYPE BY IDENTIFYING  THE  END-USE  ENTITY  CONSUMING  THE
 ELECTRICITY  OR  RECEIVING THE ELECTRIC CREDITS GENERATED BY THE PROJECT
 AND HOW SUCH END-USER IS CLASSIFIED IN A UTILITIES' ESTABLISHED ELECTRIC
 RATE STRUCTURES FOR DIFFERENT CUSTOMER CLASSES,  INCLUDING  RESIDENTIAL,
 COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AGRICULTURAL OR LOW-INCOME;
  (3) CATEGORIES BASED ON SOLAR ARRAY LOCATION, SPECIFYING WHETHER SOLAR
 ARRAYS  ARE ROOF-MOUNTED, DESIGNATING PREFERRED SITES FOR SOLAR DEVELOP-
 MENT AND INELIGIBLE SITES;
  (4) CATEGORIES BASED  ON  SOLAR  ARRAY  DESIGN,  INCLUDING  SPECIFYING
 WHETHER SUCH SOLAR ARRAY UTILIZES DUAL USE OR AGRIVOLTAICS; AND
  (II)  FOR  MAJOR  RENEWABLE  ENERGY FACILITIES SITED ON PRIME SOILS OR
 FARMLANDS, THE APPLICANT TO SUBMIT DECOMMISSIONING PLANS FOR  ARRAYS  ON
 AGRICULTURAL  LAND  AND  DECOMMISSIONING  BONDS  FOR  COMMERCIAL-SCALE

  §  4.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to section 94-c of the executive  law  made  by  sections
