  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023, as LGBTQ+ Pride Month in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, New York State's diversity has  always  been  its  greatest
strength; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lesbian,  Gay,  Bisexual,  Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+)
people have made important and lasting contributions to our great  State
and Nation in every field of endeavor including business, medicine, law,
humanities,  science,  literature,  politics,  education,  music,
philanthropy, sports, arts, and culture that enrich our  national  life;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  LGBTQ+  New Yorkers also mobilized the State and Nation to
respond to the domestic HIV/AIDS epidemic and have played a  vital  role
in broadening this country's response to the global HIV pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  LGBTQ+  people  come from all walks of life, regardless of
race, color, religion, ancestry, ethnicity,  national  origin,  economic
status,  physical  or  mental  ability,  medical  condition, sex, gender
identity or expression; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year in June marks the anniversary  of  the  Stonewall
Rebellion; this event is widely considered to constitute the single most
important  event  leading  to  the  LGBTQ+  liberation  movement and the
modern-day fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The event inspired LGBTQ+ people throughout the country  to
organize  in  support  of  LGBTQ+  rights, and, within two years, LGBTQ+
rights organizations were founded in nearly every major city; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Stonewall Rebellion was led by trans elders like Marsha
P.  Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, without whom  the  hard-fought  victories
the LGBTQ+ community has come to enjoy in recent years and decades would
not have been possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition of these contributions, it is incumbent on
the more privileged members of the LGBTQ+ community to fight  to  defend
trans  people  and trans youth from unprecedented infringements on their
human rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, LGBTQ+ New Yorkers, their families  and  friends,  and  all
those  committed  to  justice and equality celebrate during the month of
June the rich culture, the notable  achievements,  and  the  outstanding
contributions that LGBTQ+ New Yorkers make to our great State and Nation
and  continue to advocate to uphold and advance LGBTQ+ rights, which are
human rights; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as LGBTQ+ Pride
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
