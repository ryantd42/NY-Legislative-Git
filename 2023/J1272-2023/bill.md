  WHEREAS, The arts, in whatever form depicted, are central  to  human
expression;  they  are truly a universal language and their contribution
to the development of friendship and  understanding  among  all  peoples
cannot be underestimated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those musical organizations that have brought entertainment  and
cultural enrichment to the citizens of the great State of New York; and

Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory of Music was founded in 1897, during  which
time it served approximately 200 students; and

transformed  into  a  community music school, serving 15,000 individuals
through music instruction and music therapy,  and  performing  community
concerts throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally located in the opera house which now belongs to
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the conservatory now has  two  facilities

tailored  to  suit  each  partner site's needs, with offerings including
bucket drumming, early childhood music and movement, band and more; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Brooklyn Conservatory of Music is proud to serve as  an
esteemed  provider  of  music  therapy,  a psychotherapeutic practice in
which clinically trained professionals use music as a  tool  to  promote
the  developmental  and  social-emotional  growth  of  clients  of  all
abilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, BKCM's Park Slope home is filled with the sounds of private
lessons, group classes, ensembles and workshops  for  music-makers  ages
two  to  83;  teaching  almost  every  instrument imaginable and hosting
several ensembles and fellowship  programs,  students  and  faculty  are
guided by CMS's core values of joy, community, perseverance, quality and

Conservatory  of  Music  has  demonstrated  continuous  service  to  the
residents and communities which it serves; and

characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
