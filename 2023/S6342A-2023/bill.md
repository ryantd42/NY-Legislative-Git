 forth  codes of ethics, disclosure requirements and prohibiting business

 conducted in accordance with rules and regulations  promulgated  by  the
 respective  representative campus student association in accordance with
 guidelines established by the state university trustees. THE ELECTION OF
 THE FACULTY OR STAFF MEMBER SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  RULES

 amended. For the purpose of determining such year all initial  terms  of

 first day of July of the year in which such  colleges  were  established
 and  the  terms  of  their  successors  for full terms, if any, shall be
