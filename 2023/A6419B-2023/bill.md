 Introduced by M. of A. STIRPE -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Governmental Employees
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  increasing the earning limitations for retired law  enforcement  offi-
  cers; and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon the expira-
  tion thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND TWO OF THIS
 SECTION, THE EARNINGS LIMITATION FOR THE YEAR TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR
 AND  THEREAFTER  SHALL  BE SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A RETIRED LAW
 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER EMPLOYED AS A LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICER  AFTER  SUCH
 RETIREMENT.  FOR  THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT
 OFFICER" SHALL MEAN A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER, A RETIRED  STATE  TROOPER,
 OR A RETIRED DEPUTY SHERIFF.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed January 1, 2029.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  Insofar as it would affect the New York  State  and  Local  Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), this bill would allow retired police officers and depu-
 ty sheriffs to be reemployed in a law enforcement capacity with an annu-
 al  salary  of $65,000 or less to continue to receive their full retire-
 ment benefit for the 5-year period beginning January 1, 2024 and  ending
 December  31,  2028.  Currently,  the  post-retirement earnings limit is
 $35,000.
  If this bill were enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  the
 direct  cost  incurred  would  be the retiree's post-retirement earnings
 more than $35,000 each calendar year, not to  exceed  the  full  pension
 benefit paid by the NYSLRS during that period.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant to this proposal, an annual cost of $30,000 is expected.
  In addition to the direct costs quoted above, insofar as this proposal
 disrupts  the usual pattern and timing of employee turnover (that is, if
 members retire earlier than expected and participating employers hire  a
 retiree  instead  of  a  new billable member), shifts in member behavior
 could generate losses that increase the average billing rate in  20-year
 and 25-year service-based plans from 27.8% to 40.4%. The actual increase
 in  billing rates will depend upon member and employer utilization, with
 the rate above representing an upper maximum.
  All costs will be shared by the State of New York and all  participat-
 ing employers in the NYSLRS and spread over future billing cycles. Since
 this  proposal  exclusively  benefits  retirees, the increased costs are
 primarily attributable to retirees from Tiers 1 - 4. Approximately  half
 the  contributions  required  to fund this proposal will be collected on
 salary reported for current members of Tier 6.
