 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  increasing the earning limitations for retired persons in positions of
  public service
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS
 SECTION, THE EARNINGS LIMITATION FOR RETIRED PERSONS IN  A  POSITION  OF
 PUBLIC  SERVICE  SHALL  BE  INCREASED TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE
 YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND THEREAFTER.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would add a new  subdivision  2-a  to  Section  212  of  the
 Retirement  and  Social  Security Law to increase the earnings-after-re-
 tirement limitation to $50,000 for retired members who return to work in
 positions of public employment for calendar year  2024  and  thereafter.
 Currently this earnings limitation is $35,000.
  This  increase  in  the earnings-after-retirement limit is expected to
 have an impact on the Retirement System's patterns of retirement and  it
 is  expected  that  some members will retire earlier than they otherwise
 would have. Earlier retirement  generally  increases  plan  costs  since
 members will be receiving their benefits for a longer period. If retire-
 ment patterns shift more than expected, there will be additional costs.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
