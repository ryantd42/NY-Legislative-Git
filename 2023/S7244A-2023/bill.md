 PURCHASER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD  WITHOUT
 NOTICE  OF A CLAIM OF A PROPERTY RIGHT IN IT AS IF THE REFERENCE IN THAT
 SUBSECTION TO "THE INSTRUMENT" REFERRED TO THE  CONTROLLABLE  ELECTRONIC
 RECORD.  THE  PRECEDING  SENTENCE APPLIES EVEN IF THE CONTROLLABLE ELEC-
 TRONIC RECORD CONTAINS A TERM BY WHICH AN OBLIGOR OR ACCOUNT  DEBTOR  ON
 THE CONTROLLABLE ACCOUNT OR CONTROLLABLE PAYMENT INTANGIBLE EVIDENCED BY
 THE  CONTROLLABLE  ELECTRONIC  RECORD  WAIVES  OR  AGREES  NOT TO ASSERT

 NOR.

 TRONIC  SIGNATURES  IN  GLOBAL  AND  NATIONAL  COMMERCE  ACT,  15 U.S.C.
 SECTION 7021(A)(1), AS AMENDED; OR,

 INTANGIBLE,  INCLUDING  THE  RIGHTS  AND BENEFITS UNDER SUBSECTIONS (C),
 (D), (E), (G), AND (H) OF A PURCHASER AND QUALIFYING PURCHASER,  IN  THE
 SAME MANNER THIS SECTION APPLIES TO A CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD.
 S. 7244  3
 
  (B)  CONTROL OF CONTROLLABLE ACCOUNT AND CONTROLLABLE PAYMENT INTANGI-
 BLE. TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PURCHASER OF A  CONTROLLABLE  ACCOUNT  OR  A

 CONTROL OF THE CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD THAT EVIDENCES THE ACCOUNT
 OR PAYMENT INTANGIBLE.
  (C)  APPLICABILITY  OF  OTHER  LAW TO ACQUISITION OF RIGHTS. EXCEPT AS
 PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION, LAW OTHER THAN THIS ARTICLE DETERMINES WHETHER
 A PERSON ACQUIRES A RIGHT IN A CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC  RECORD  AND  THE
 RIGHT THE PERSON ACQUIRES.
  (D) SHELTER PRINCIPLE AND PURCHASE OF LIMITED INTEREST. A PURCHASER OF
 A CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD ACQUIRES ALL RIGHTS IN THE CONTROLLABLE
 ELECTRONIC  RECORD  THAT  THE  TRANSFEROR  HAD OR HAD POWER TO TRANSFER,
 EXCEPT THAT A PURCHASER OF A LIMITED INTEREST IN  A  CONTROLLABLE  ELEC-
 TRONIC  RECORD  ACQUIRES  RIGHTS  ONLY  TO  THE  EXTENT  OF THE INTEREST
 PURCHASED.
  (E) RIGHTS OF QUALIFYING PURCHASER. A  QUALIFYING  PURCHASER  ACQUIRES
 ITS  RIGHTS  IN  THE CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD FREE OF A CLAIM OF A
 PROPERTY RIGHT IN THE CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD.

 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTIONS (A) AND (E) FOR A CONTROLLABLE ACCOUNT
 AND  A CONTROLLABLE PAYMENT INTANGIBLE OR LAW OTHER THAN THIS ARTICLE, A

 RECORD SUBJECT TO A CLAIM OF A PROPERTY RIGHT IN THE RIGHT  TO  PAYMENT,
 RIGHT TO PERFORMANCE, OR OTHER INTEREST IN PROPERTY.
  (G)  NO-ACTION  PROTECTION FOR QUALIFYING PURCHASER. AN ACTION MAY NOT
 BE ASSERTED AGAINST A QUALIFYING PURCHASER BASED ON BOTH A  PURCHASE  BY
 THE QUALIFYING PURCHASER OF A CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD AND A CLAIM
 OF  A  PROPERTY RIGHT IN ANOTHER CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD, WHETHER
 THE ACTION IS FRAMED IN CONVERSION, REPLEVIN, CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST,  EQUI-
 TABLE LIEN, OR OTHER THEORY.
  (H) FILING NOT NOTICE. FILING OF A FINANCING STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 9
 IS NOT NOTICE OF A CLAIM OF A PROPERTY RIGHT IN A CONTROLLABLE ELECTRON-
 IC RECORD.
 SECTION 12--105. CONTROL OF CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD.
  (A)  GENERAL RULE: CONTROL OF CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD. A PERSON

 LOGICALLY  ASSOCIATED  WITH  THE ELECTRONIC RECORD, OR A SYSTEM IN WHICH
 S. 7244  4
 
 THE ELECTRONIC RECORD IS RECORDED  LIMITS  THE  USE  OF  THE  ELECTRONIC
 RECORD  OR  HAS  A  PROTOCOL  PROGRAMMED  TO CAUSE A CHANGE, INCLUDING A
 TRANSFER OR LOSS OF CONTROL OR A MODIFICATION OF  BENEFITS  AFFORDED  BY
 THE ELECTRONIC RECORD; OR
  (2) THE POWER IS SHARED WITH ANOTHER PERSON.
  (C)  WHEN POWER NOT SHARED WITH ANOTHER PERSON. A POWER OF A PERSON IS
 NOT SHARED WITH ANOTHER PERSON UNDER SUBSECTION (B)(2) AND THE  PERSON'S

 LABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD IF ANOTHER PERSON, OTHER THAN THE TRANSFEROR  TO
 THE  PERSON  OF  AN  INTEREST IN THE CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD OR A

 CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD:
  (1) HAS CONTROL OF THE ELECTRONIC RECORD AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT  HAS
 CONTROL ON BEHALF OF THE PERSON; OR
  (2) OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE ELECTRONIC RECORD AFTER HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED
 THAT  IT  WILL  OBTAIN CONTROL OF THE ELECTRONIC RECORD ON BEHALF OF THE
 PERSON.
  (F) NO REQUIREMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. A PERSON  THAT  HAS  CONTROL  UNDER
 THIS  SECTION  IS  NOT  REQUIRED  TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT HAS CONTROL ON
 BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON.
  (G) NO DUTIES OR CONFIRMATION. IF A PERSON ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS OR
 WILL OBTAIN CONTROL ON BEHALF  OF  ANOTHER  PERSON,  UNLESS  THE  PERSON
