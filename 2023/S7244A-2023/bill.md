  (8) SECTION 12--107.
  §  4. Section 1--306 of the uniform commercial code, as added by chap-
 ter 505 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
 Section 1--306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.
  A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in
 whole or in part without consideration by  agreement  of  the  aggrieved
 party in [an authenticated] A SIGNED record.
  §  5. Section 2--102 of the uniform commercial code is amended to read
 as follows:
 Section 2--102. Scope; Certain Security and Other Transactions  Excluded
  From This Article.
  (1)  Unless  the context otherwise requires, AND EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
 SUBSECTION (3), this Article applies to transactions in goods[; it  does
 not  apply  to any transaction which although in the form of an uncondi-
 tional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a
 security transaction nor does this Article impair or repeal any  statute
 regulating  sales  to  consumers,  farmers or other specified classes of
 buyers], IT APPLIES TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (2).
  (2) IN A HYBRID TRANSACTION:
  (A)  IF  THE  SALE-OF-GOODS  ASPECTS  DO  NOT  PREDOMINATE,  ONLY  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS ARTICLE WHICH RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE SALE-OF-GOODS
 ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION APPLY, AND THE PROVISIONS THAT RELATE  PRIMA-
 RILY TO THE TRANSACTION AS A WHOLE DO NOT APPLY.
  (B)  IF THE SALE-OF-GOODS ASPECTS PREDOMINATE, THIS ARTICLE APPLIES TO
 THE TRANSACTION BUT DOES NOT PRECLUDE APPLICATION IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUM-
 STANCES OF OTHER LAW TO ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH DO  NOT  RELATE
 TO THE SALE OF GOODS.
  (3) THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT:
  (A)  APPLY TO A TRANSACTION THAT, EVEN THOUGH IN THE FORM OF AN UNCON-
 DITIONAL CONTRACT TO SELL OR PRESENT SALE, OPERATES  ONLY  TO  CREATE  A
 SECURITY INTEREST; OR
  (B) IMPAIR OR REPEAL A STATUTE REGULATING SALES TO CONSUMERS, FARMERS,
 OR OTHER SPECIFIED CLASSES OF BUYERS.
  §  6. Section 2--106 of the uniform commercial code is amended to read
 as follows:
 Section 2--106. Definitions.  "Contract";  "Agreement";  "Contract  for
  Sale";  "Sale";  "Present  Sale";  "Conforming"  to
  Contract; "Termination"; "Cancellation"; "HYBRID TRAN-
  SACTION".
  (1) In this Article, unless the context otherwise requires, "contract"
 and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present  or  future
 sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods
 and  a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the
 S. 7244--A  4
 
 passing of title from the seller to  the  buyer  for  a  price  (Section
 2--401).  A  "present  sale"  means  a sale which is accomplished by the
 making of the contract.
  (2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conform-
 ing"  or  conform  to  the contract when they are in accordance with the
 obligations under the contract.
  (3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created
 by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than  for  its
 breach.  On  "termination"  all obligations which are still executory on
 both sides are discharged  but  any  right  based  on  prior  breach  or
 performance survives.
  (4)  "Cancellation"  occurs  when  either  party  puts  an  end to the
 contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as  that  of
 "termination"  except  that the cancelling party also retains any remedy
 for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
  (5) "HYBRID TRANSACTION" MEANS A SINGLE TRANSACTION INVOLVING  A  SALE
 OF GOODS AND:
  (A) THE PROVISION OF SERVICES;
  (B) A LEASE OF OTHER GOODS; OR
  (C) A SALE, LEASE, OR LICENSE OF PROPERTY OTHER THAN GOODS.
  §  7.  Subsections 1 and 2 of section 2--201 of the uniform commercial
 code are amended to read as follows:
  (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a  contract  for  the
 sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of
 action  or defense unless there is [some writing] A RECORD sufficient to
 indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties  and
 signed  by  the party against whom enforcement is sought or by [his] THE
 PARTY'S authorized agent  or  broker.  A  writing  is  not  insufficient
 because  it  omits  or  incorrectly  states  a  term agreed upon but the
 contract is not enforceable under this [paragraph] SUBSECTION beyond the
 quantity of goods shown in [such writing] THE RECORD.
  (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a  [writing]  RECORD
 in  confirmation  of  the  contract and sufficient against the sender is
 received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents,  it
 satisfies  the  requirements  of subsection (1) against [such] THE party
 unless written notice IN A RECORD of objection to its contents is  given
 within ten days after it is received.

 chapter 505 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
 Section 2--202. Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence.
  Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the  parties
 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a [writing] RECORD intended by
 the  parties  as  a  final expression of their agreement with respect to
 such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted  by  evidence
 of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be
 explained or supplemented
  (a)  by  course  of  performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade
 (Section 1--303); and
  (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court  finds
 the [writing] RECORD to have been intended also as a complete and exclu-
 sive statement of the terms of the agreement.
  §  9. Section 2--203 of the uniform commercial code is amended to read
 as follows:
 Section 2--203. Seals Inoperative.
  The affixing of a seal to a [writing] RECORD evidencing a contract for
 sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the  [writing]
 S. 7244--A  5
 
 RECORD  a  sealed  instrument and the law with respect to sealed instru-
 ments does not apply to such a contract or offer.
  § 10. Section 2--205 of the uniform commercial code is amended to read
 as follows:
 Section 2--205. Firm Offers.
  An  offer  by  a  merchant  to buy or sell goods in a signed [writing]
 RECORD which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held  open  is
 not  revocable,  for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if
 no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period
 of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on
 a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

 amended to read as follows:

 ment on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the
 other party.
  §  12.  Section  2-A-102  of  the uniform commercial code, as added by
 chapter 114 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
 Section 2-A-102. Scope.
  (1) This Article applies to any transaction, regardless of form,  that
 creates  a  lease  AND, IN THE CASE OF A HYBRID LEASE, IT APPLIES TO THE
 EXTENT PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (2).
  (2) IN A HYBRID LEASE:
  (A) IF THE LEASE-OF-GOODS ASPECTS DO NOT PREDOMINATE:
  (I) ONLY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE WHICH RELATE PRIMARILY TO  THE
 LEASE-OF-GOODS ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION APPLY, AND THE PROVISIONS THAT
 RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE TRANSACTION AS A WHOLE DO NOT APPLY;
  (II) SECTION 2-A-209 APPLIES IF THE LEASE IS A FINANCE LEASE; AND
  (III)  SECTION  2-A-407  APPLIES  TO  THE  PROMISES OF THE LESSEE IN A
 FINANCE LEASE TO THE EXTENT THE PROMISES ARE CONSIDERATION FOR THE RIGHT
 TO POSSESSION AND USE OF THE LEASED GOODS; AND
  (B) IF THE LEASE-OF-GOODS ASPECTS PREDOMINATE, THIS ARTICLE APPLIES TO
 THE TRANSACTION,  BUT  DOES  NOT  PRECLUDE  APPLICATION  IN  APPROPRIATE
 CIRCUMSTANCES  OF  OTHER LAW TO ASPECTS OF THE LEASE WHICH DO NOT RELATE
 TO THE LEASE OF GOODS.
  § 13. Subsection 1 of section 2-A-103 of the uniform  commercial  code

 the aggrieved party.
  § 15. Subsections 1, 3 and 5 of section 2-A-201 of the uniform commer-
 cial  code,  as added by chapter 114 of the laws of 1994, are amended to
 read as follows:
  (1) A lease contract is not enforceable by way of  action  or  defense
 unless:
 S. 7244--A  6
 
  (a) the  total  payments  to  be  made  under the lease contract,
  excluding payments for options to renew or buy, are less than
  $1,000; or
  (b) there is a [writing] RECORD, signed by the party against whom
  enforcement  is  sought  or by that party's authorized agent,
  sufficient to indicate that a lease contract  has  been  made
  between  the parties and to describe the goods leased and the
  lease term.
  (3) A [writing] RECORD is not insufficient because it omits or  incor-
 rectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforce-

 Section 2-A-202. Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence.
  Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the  parties
 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a [writing] RECORD intended by
 the  parties  as  a  final expression of their agreement with respect to
 such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted  by  evidence
 of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be
 explained or supplemented:

 assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by

  (3) THE OBLIGATION OF A PARTY TO PAY A CHECK IS NOT DISCHARGED  SOLELY

 MATION  IS  EXTRACTED  FROM  THE CHECK AND AN IMAGE OF THE CHECK IS MADE
 AND,  SUBSEQUENTLY,  THE  INFORMATION  AND  IMAGE  ARE  TRANSMITTED  FOR
 PAYMENT.
  §  23. Paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of section 4-A-103 of the uniform
 commercial code, as amended by chapter 208  of  the  laws  of  1990,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) "Payment order" means an instruction of a sender to a receiv-
  ing  bank, transmitted orally[, electronically,] or in [writ-
  ing] A RECORD, to pay, or to cause another  bank  to  pay,  a
  fixed or determinable amount of money to a beneficiary if:
  (i) the  instruction does not state a condition to payment to
  the beneficiary other than time of payment,
  (ii) the receiving bank is to be  reimbursed  by  debiting  an
  account  of,  or  otherwise  receiving  payment from, the
  sender, and
  (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly  to
  the receiving bank or to an agent, funds transfer system,
  or  communication system for transmittal to the receiving
  bank.
  § 24. Section 4-A-201 of the uniform  commercial  code,  as  added  by
 chapter 208 of the laws of 1990, is amended to read as follows:
 Section 4-A-201. Security Procedure.
  "Security  procedure"  means a procedure established by agreement of a
 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (1)  verifying  that  a
 payment order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is
 that  of the customer, or (2) detecting error in the transmission or the
 content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure  may
 S. 7244--A  8
 
 IMPOSE  AN  OBLIGATION  ON  THE  RECEIVING  BANK OR THE CUSTOMER AND MAY
 require the use of algorithms or other codes,  identifying  words  [or],
 numbers,  SYMBOLS,  SOUNDS, BIOMETRICS, encryption, callback procedures,
 or  similar  security  devices.  Comparison of a signature on a payment
 order or communication with an  authorized  specimen  signature  of  the
 customer  OR  REQUIRING  A  PAYMENT  ORDER TO BE SENT FROM A KNOWN EMAIL
 ADDRESS, IP ADDRESS, OR TELEPHONE NUMBER is not  by  itself  a  security
 procedure.
  § 25. Subsections 2 and 3 of section 4-A-202 of the uniform commercial
 code,  as  added by chapter 208 of the laws of 1990, are amended to read
 as follows:
  (2) If a bank and its customer have agreed that  the  authenticity  of
 payment  orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender
 will be verified pursuant to  a  security  procedure,  a  payment  order
 received  by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the custom-
 er, whether or not authorized,  if  (a)  the  security  procedure  is  a
 commercially  reasonable  method of providing security against unauthor-
 ized payment orders, and (b)  the  bank  proves  that  it  accepted  the
 payment  order  in  good  faith  and in compliance with the BANK'S OBLI-
 GATIONS UNDER THE security procedure  and  any  [written]  agreement  or
 instruction  of the customer, EVIDENCED BY A RECORD, restricting accept-
 ance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The  bank  is
 not  required  to  follow  an  instruction  that violates [a written] AN
 agreement with the customer, EVIDENCED BY A RECORD, or notice  of  which
 is  not  received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reason-
 able opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.
  (3) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of
 law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed
 to the bank, the circumstances  of  the  customer  known  to  the  bank,
 including  the  size,  type,  and  frequency  of payment orders normally
 issued by the customer to  the  bank,  alternative  security  procedures
 offered  to  the  customer,  and  security  procedures in general use by
 customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A  security  procedure
 is  deemed  to  be commercially reasonable if (a) the security procedure
 was chosen by the customer after the  bank  offered,  and  the  customer
 refused,  a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that
 customer, and (b) the customer expressly agreed in [writing] A RECORD to
 be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in  its
 name  and accepted by the bank in compliance with the BANK'S OBLIGATIONS
 UNDER THE security procedure chosen by the customer.
  § 26. Subsection 1 of section 4-A-203 of the uniform commercial  code,
 as  added  by  chapter  208  of  the laws of 1990, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (1) If an accepted payment order  is  not,  under  subsection  (1)  of
 Section 4-A-202, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender,
 but  is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection (2)
 of Section 4-A-202, the following rules apply:
  (a) By express [written] agreement EVIDENCED  BY  A  RECORD,  the
  receiving  bank  may limit the extent to which it is entitled
  to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
  (b) The receiving bank is  not  entitled  to  enforce  or  retain
  payment  of the payment order if the customer proves that the
  order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i)
  entrusted at any time with duties to  act  for  the  customer
  with  respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or
  (ii) who obtained access to transmitting  facilities  of  the
 S. 7244--A  9
 
  customer  or  who  obtained,  from a source controlled by the
  customer and without authority of the receiving bank,  infor-
  mation facilitating breach of the security procedure, regard-
  less  of  how  the  information  was  obtained or whether the
  customer was at  fault.  Information  includes  any  access
  device, computer software, or the like.
  §  27. Subsection 3 of section 4-A-207 of the uniform commercial code,
 as added by chapter 208 of the laws of  1990,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (3)  If  (i)  a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted,
 (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsist-
 ently by name and number, and (iii)  the  beneficiary's  bank  pays  the
 person  identified by number as permitted by paragraph (a) of subsection
 (2), the following rules apply:
  (a) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay
  its order.
  (b) If the originator is not a bank and proves  that  the  person
  identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from
  the  originator,  the  originator  is  not obliged to pay its
  order unless the originator's bank proves that  the  origina-
  tor,  before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice
  that payment of a payment  order  issued  by  the  originator
  might  be  made  by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an
  identifying or bank account number even if  it  identifies  a
  person  different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
  may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank

  that  the  sender, before the payment order was accepted, had
  notice that the receiving bank might rely on  the  number  as
  the  proper  identification  of the intermediary or benefici-
  ary's bank even if it identifies a person different from  the
  bank  identified  by  name, the rights and obligations of the
  sender and the receiving bank are governed by  paragraph  (a)
  of subsection (2), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of
  notice  may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving
  bank satisfies the burden of proof  if  it  proves  that  the
  sender,  before  the  payment  order  was  accepted, signed a
  [writing] RECORD stating the information to which the  notice
  relates.
  §  29. Subsection 1 of section 4-A-210 of the uniform commercial code,
 as added by chapter 208 of the laws of  1990,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (1)  A  payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
 rejection transmitted to the  sender  orally,  [electronically,]  or  in
 [writing]  A  RECORD.  A notice of rejection need not use any particular
 words and is sufficient if it  indicates  that  the  receiving  bank  is
 rejecting  the  order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is
 effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is
 reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is  given  by  a
 S. 7244--A  10
 
 means  that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is
 received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving  bank  establishes
 the  means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying
 with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not
 reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted
 from the use of the noncomplying means.

 not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the  communication  is
 verified  pursuant  to  the security procedure or the bank agrees to the
 cancellation or amendment.
  § 31. Subsections 3 and 4 of section 4-A-305 of the uniform commercial
 code, as added by chapter 208 of the laws of 1990, are amended  to  read

 damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the  extent
 provided  in  an  express  [written]  agreement  of  the receiving bank,
 EVIDENCED BY A RECORD.
  (4) If a receiving bank fails  to  execute  a  payment  order  it  was
 obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to
 the  sender  for  its  expenses  in  the  transaction and for incidental
 expenses and interest losses resulting  from  the  failure  to  execute.
 Additional  damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to

 an agreement in the form of a record signed [or otherwise authenticated]
 by the affected parties [in the manner provided in section 5--104] or by
 a provision in the person's letter of  credit,  confirmation,  or  other
 undertaking.  The  jurisdiction  whose  law  is chosen need not bear any
 relation to the transaction.
  (b) Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an
 issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is  governed
 by  the  law  of  the  jurisdiction  in which the person is located. The

 an  issuer,  nominated  person,  or  adviser is governed by any rules of
 custom or practice, such as the uniform customs and practice  for  docu-
 mentary  credits,  to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other
 undertaking is expressly made subject. If (1) this article would  govern
 the  liability  of  an  issuer,  nominated  person,  or  adviser  under
 subsection (a) or (b) of  this  section,  (2) the  relevant  undertaking
 incorporates  rules  of  custom  or  practice, and (3) there is conflict
 between this article and those rules as  applied  to  that  undertaking,
 those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvar-
 iable provisions specified in subsection (c) of section 5--103.
  [(d)]  (E) If there is conflict between this article and article 3, 4,
 4-A or 9, this article governs.

 ing within this article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding
 effect  that  governing  law may be chosen in accordance with subsection
 (a) of this section.

 (g) AND (I), notification is ineffective under subsection (a):
  (1) if it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned;
  (2) to the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and
  a  seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's
  duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation
  is effective under law other than this article; or
  (3) at the option of an account debtor, if the notification noti-
  fies the account debtor to make less than the full amount  of
  any  installment  or  other periodic payment to the assignee,
  even if:
  (A) only a portion of the account, chattel paper, or  payment
  intangible has been assigned to that assignee;
  (B) a portion has been assigned to another assignee; or
  (C) the  account  debtor  knows  that  the assignment to that
  assignee is limited.

 furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made.  Unless  the

 tion under subsection (a).

 THIS SUBSECTION, "PROMISSORY NOTE" INCLUDES A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT THAT

 and  Sections  2-A-303 and 9--407, and subject to subsection (g), a term
 in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a  prom-
 issory note is ineffective to the extent that it:
  (1) prohibits,  restricts, or requires the consent of the account
  debtor or person obligated on  the  promissory  note  to  the
  assignment  or  transfer  of,  or  the  creation, attachment,
  perfection, or enforcement of a  security  interest  in,  the
  account,  chattel  paper,  payment  intangible, or promissory
  note; or
  (2) provides that the assignment or  transfer  or  the  creation,
  attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security inter-
  est  may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment,

  claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or  remedy
  under  the  account,  chattel  paper,  payment intangible, or
  promissory note.
  (e) Inapplicability of subsection (d) to certain sales. Subsection (d)
 does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note.

 SUBSECTIONS (g) AND (I), an account debtor may not  waive  or  vary  its
 option under subsection (b)(3).
  (g) Rule  for individual under other law. This section is subject to a
 rule of law, statute, rule or regulation other than this  article  which
 establishes  a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual
 and who incurred the  obligation  primarily  for  personal,  family,  or
 household purposes.
  (h) Inapplicability. This section does not apply to:
  (1) an  assignment  of  a health care insurance receivable to the
  extent such  assignment  conflicts  with  other  law  or  the
  parties have otherwise agreed in writing that such receivable
  is non-assignable,

  sickness as described in 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(1)  and  (2),  as
