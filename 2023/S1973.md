 Introduced  by  Sen.  RAMOS  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and Pensions
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in relation to  requiring  dental
  insurance  plans  to  automatically  carry  over  a  portion  of  the
  enrollee's benefit amount for use in the succeeding year

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 2 of section 160 of the civil service law, as
 amended by chapter 414 of the laws  of  1980,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  The  president,  in  his  discretion, is hereby empowered to make,
 amend and rescind, from time to time, regulations establishing a  dental
 insurance  plan  which  shall  be  a  part  of the health insurance plan
 authorized by this article. Such regulations may provide for negotiating
 unit, employee and employer participation or nonparticipation, employee,
 dependent and retiree eligibility or noneligibility  and  such  contrib-
 ution  rates as the president may determine even though such regulations
 establish standards which differ from those applicable by law  to  other
 parts  of such health insurance plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH REGU-
 LATIONS SHALL REQUIRE DENTAL INSURANCE PLANS TO  AUTOMATICALLY  ANNUALLY
 CARRY  OVER ANY UNUSED BENEFIT AMOUNT OF SUCH PLAN IN AN AMOUNT UP TO AT
 LEAST TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE ENROLLEE'S  BENEFIT  AMOUNT  AND  WHICH
 SHALL BE ADDED TO THE ENROLLEE'S BENEFIT AMOUNT FOR THE SUCCEEDING YEAR.
 The president is hereby authorized and directed to provide in such regu-
 lations  for  participation  in  the  dental insurance plan by retirees;
 provided, however, that the claims  experience  for  retirees  shall  be
 separately  rated  and  premiums established separate from other partic-
 ipants in the plan and provided further that the full costs  of  partic-
 ipation in such plan, including all administrative costs, shall be borne
 by  such  retirees. Considering the dental insurance plan as a whole, no
 regulation enacted pursuant to this subdivision shall provide or  permit
 a  benefit structure inconsistent with the most efficient and economical
 administration of such plan.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
