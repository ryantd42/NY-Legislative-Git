 follows:
  1. Industrial controversy. (a) The accumulation of benefit rights by a
 claimant  shall  be suspended during a period of [two consecutive weeks]
 ONE WEEK beginning with the day after such  claimant  lost  his  or  her
 employment  because  of  a strike or other industrial controversy except
 for lockouts, including concerted activity not authorized or  sanctioned
 by  the  recognized  or  certified bargaining agent of the claimant, and
 other concerted activity conducted in violation of any existing  collec-

 employed, except that benefit rights may be accumulated before the expi-
 ration of such [two] ONE week period beginning with the day  after  such
 strike or other industrial controversy was terminated.
  (b) Benefits shall not be suspended under this section if:

 to return to his or her prior position upon conclusion of the strike, in
 the event the strike terminates prior to the conclusion of  the  employ-
 ee's eligibility for benefit rights under this chapter. In the event the
 employer  does  not  permit  such  return  after such certification, the

 section five hundred fifty-two-b of this article; or
  (ii) The commissioner determines that the claimant:
  (A)  is not employed by an employer that is involved in the industrial
 controversy that caused his or her unemployment and is not participating
 in the industrial controversy; or
  (B) is not in a bargaining unit involved in the industrial controversy
 that caused his or her unemployment and  is  not  participating  in  the
 industrial controversy.
  3. Terms of suspension. [No] THE waiting period may be served during a
 suspension period.
  The  suspension  of accumulation of benefit rights shall not be termi-
 nated by subsequent employment of the claimant irrespective of when  the
 claim  is  filed  except as provided in subdivision one and shall not be
 confined to a single benefit year.
  A "week" as used in subdivision one of this section  means  any  seven
 consecutive calendar days.
