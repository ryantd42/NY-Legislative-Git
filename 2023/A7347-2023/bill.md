 er. Every such employee shall continue to  be  eligible  for  disability
 benefits  during  such  employment  and for a period of four weeks after

 such four week period the employee performs any work for remuneration or
 profit  for  another covered employer the employee shall become eligible
 for disability benefits immediately with respect to that employment.  In
 addition  every  such employee who has previously completed four or more
 consecutive weeks in employment with the covered employer  for  purposes

 MENT BENEFITS, SUCH EMPLOYEES SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FAMILY  LEAVE  BENE-
 FITS  UPON  RETURNING  TO WORK IF THEY ARE OTHERWISE QUALIFIED BY HAVING
 WORKED AT LEAST TWENTY-SIX OF THE LAST THIRTY-NINE  WEEKS.  An  employee

 immediately  with  respect to such employment.  An employee regularly in

 benefits on the twenty-fifth day of  such  regular  employment  and  for
 purposes  of  paid  family  leave  an employer shall become eligible for
 benefits on the one hundred seventy-fifth day of  such  regular  employ-
 ment.  An employee who is eligible for disability and family leave bene-
 fits in the employment of a covered employer shall not  be  deemed,  for
 the  purposes of this article, to have such employment terminated during
 any period he or she is eligible to receive benefits under  section  two
 hundred four of this article with respect to such employment.
