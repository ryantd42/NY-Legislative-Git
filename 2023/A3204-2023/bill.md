  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 "Vionique Valnord's law".
  § 2. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 3 of section 1194 of the vehicle and
 traffic  law,  as added by chapter 47 of the laws of 1988, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (d) Court order; procedure. (1) An application for a  court  order  to
 compel submission to a chemical test or any portion thereof, may be made
 to any supreme court justice, county court judge or district court judge
 in the judicial district in which the incident occurred, or if the inci-
 dent  occurred  in the city of New York before any supreme court justice
 or judge of the criminal court of the city of New York. Such application
 may be communicated by telephone, radio or  other  means  of  electronic
 communication, or in person.
  (2)  The  applicant  must provide identification by name and title and
 must state the purpose of the communication. Upon being advised that  an
 application for a court order to compel submission to a chemical test is
 being made, the court shall place under oath the applicant and any other
 person  providing  information in support of the application as provided
 in subparagraph three of this paragraph. After being sworn the applicant
 must state that the person from whom the chemical test was requested was
 the operator of a motor vehicle and in the course of  such  operation  a
 person,  other  than  the operator, has been killed or seriously injured
 and, based upon the totality of circumstances, there is reasonable cause

 to believe that such person was operating a motor vehicle  in  violation
 of  any subdivision of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article
 and, after being placed under  lawful  arrest  such  person  refused  to
 submit to a chemical test or any portion thereof, in accordance with the
 provisions  of  this section or is unable to give consent to such a test
 or any portion thereof. The applicant must make specific allegations  of
 fact  to  support  such statement. Any other person properly identified,
 may present sworn allegations of fact  in  support  of  the  applicant's
 statement.
  (3)  Upon  being advised that an oral application for a court order to
 compel a person to submit to a chemical test  OF  ONE  OR  MORE  OF  THE
 FOLLOWING:  BREATH,  BLOOD,  URINE  OR SALIVA, is being made, a judge or
 justice shall place under  oath  the  applicant  and  any  other  person
 providing  information in support of the application. Such oath or oaths
 and all of the remaining communication must be recorded, either by means
 of a voice recording device or verbatim stenographic or  verbatim  long-
 hand notes. If a voice recording device is used or a stenographic record
 made, the judge must have the record transcribed, certify to the accura-
 cy  of  the transcription and file the original record and transcription
 with the court within seventy-two hours of the  issuance  of  the  court
 order. If the longhand notes are taken, the judge shall subscribe a copy
 and  file  it with the court within twenty-four hours of the issuance of
 the order.
  (4) If the court is satisfied that the requirements for  the  issuance
 of  a  court  order  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
 subdivision have been met, it may grant the  application  and  issue  an
 order  requiring the accused to submit to a chemical test OF ONE OR MORE
 OF THE FOLLOWING: BREATH, BLOOD, URINE OR SALIVA, to determine the alco-
 holic and/or drug content of his blood and ordering the withdrawal of  a
 blood  sample  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of paragraph (a) of
 subdivision four of this section. When a judge or justice determines  to
 issue  an order to compel submission to a chemical test based on an oral
 application, the applicant therefor shall prepare the order  in  accord-
 ance  with  the  instructions of the judge or justice.  In all cases the
 order shall include the name of the issuing judge or justice,  the  name
 of  the  applicant,  and  the  date and time it was issued.  It must be
 signed by the judge or justice if issued in person, or by the  applicant
 if issued orally.
  (5)  UPON  REFUSAL  BY  A  PERSON, WHO A POLICE OFFICER HAS REASONABLE
 CAUSE TO BELIEVE IS IN VIOLATION OF ANY SUBDIVISION  OF  SECTION  ELEVEN

  (6) Any false statement by an applicant or any other person in support
 of an application for a court order shall subject  such  person  to  the
 offenses  for  perjury set forth in article two hundred ten of the penal
 law.
