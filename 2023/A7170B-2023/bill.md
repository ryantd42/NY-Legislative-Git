 status,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or expression, military
 status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic character-

 A. 7170--B  2
 
  (c)  For a labor organization, because of the age, race, creed, color,
 national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual  orientation,
 gender  identity  or  expression,  military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT,
 disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, mari-
 tal  status, or status as a victim of domestic violence, of any individ-
 ual, to exclude or to expel from its membership such  individual  or  to
 discriminate  in  any  way  against  any  of  its members or against any
 employer or any individual employed by an employer.
  (d) For any employer or employment agency to  print  or  circulate  or
 cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publi-
 cation,  or to use any form of application for employment or to make any
 inquiry in  connection  with  prospective  employment,  which  expresses
 directly  or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination
 as to age, race, creed, color, national  origin,  citizenship  or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic char-
 acteristics,  familial  status, marital status, or status as a victim of
 domestic violence, or any intent to make any such limitation, specifica-
 tion or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qual-
 ification; provided,  however,  that  neither  this  paragraph  nor  any
 provision  of  this  chapter or other law shall be construed to prohibit
 the department of civil service or the department of  personnel  of  any
 city  containing  more  than one county from requesting information from
 applicants for civil service examinations concerning any of  the  afore-
 mentioned  characteristics,  other  than  sexual  orientation,  for  the
 purpose of conducting studies to identify and resolve possible  problems
 in  recruitment  and testing of members of minority groups to ensure the
 fairest possible and equal opportunities for  employment  in  the  civil
 service for all persons, regardless of age, race, creed, color, national
 origin,  citizenship or immigration status, sexual orientation or gender
 identity or expression, military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT,  disabili-
 ty,  predisposing  genetic  characteristics, familial status, or marital
 status.
  (h) (1) For an employer, licensing agency, employment agency or  labor
 organization to subject any individual to harassment because of an indi-
 vidual's  age, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status,  sex,  HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,  disability,  predisposing  genetic
 characteristics,  familial status, marital status, status as a victim of
 domestic violence, or because the individual has opposed  any  practices
 forbidden  under  this  article  or  because  the individual has filed a
 complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under  this  article,
 regardless  of  whether  such  harassment  would be considered severe or
 pervasive under precedent applied to harassment claims. Such  harassment
 is an unlawful discriminatory practice when it subjects an individual to
 inferior  terms,  conditions  or privileges of employment because of the
 individual's membership in one or more of  these  protected  categories.
 The fact that such individual did not make a complaint about the harass-
 ment  to  such  employer,  licensing  agency, employment agency or labor
 organization shall  not  be  determinative  of  whether  such  employer,
 licensing  agency,  employment  agency  or  labor  organization shall be
 liable. Nothing in this section shall imply that an employee must demon-
 strate the existence of an individual to whom the  employee's  treatment
 must  be compared. It shall be an affirmative defense to liability under
 this subdivision that the harassing conduct  does  not  rise  above  the
 level  of  what  a  reasonable  victim  of  discrimination with the same
 A. 7170--B  3
 
 protected characteristic or characteristics would consider petty slights
 or trivial inconveniences.
  (2)  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION RELATING TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN ACTION BY AN EMPLOYER, LICENSING  AGENCY,  EMPLOY-
 MENT  AGENCY, OR LABOR ORGANIZATION BASED ON A PERSON'S HEIGHT OR WEIGHT
 WHEN SUCH ACTION IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR  REGULATION.  NOTHING  IN
 THIS  SUBDIVISION  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO  PREVENT ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS
 REASONABLY TAKEN BY AN EMPLOYER, LICENSING AGENCY, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY, OR
 LABOR ORGANIZATION TO ALLOW PERSONS WHO DO NOT MEET OCCUPATIONAL  HEIGHT
 OR  WEIGHT  CRITERIA  TO  PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUISITES AND/OR NORMAL
 OPERATIONS OF A JOB.  IN INSTANCES WHERE AN EMPLOYER, LICENSING  AGENCY,
 EMPLOYMENT AGENCY, OR LABOR ORGANIZATION'S ACTION IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW
 OR REGULATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, IT SHALL BE AN AFFIRMATIVE
 DEFENSE  THAT AN ACTION WAS TAKEN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO AVAILABLE ALTER-
 NATIVE ACTIONS THE ENTITY COULD HAVE TAKEN THAT  COULD  HAVE  REASONABLY
 ALLOWED  THE  PERSON  TO  PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUISITES AND/OR NORMAL
 OPERATIONS OF THE JOB.
  § 2. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision 1-a of section 296  of

 tation, gender identity or expression,  military  status,  sex,  HEIGHT,

 victim  of domestic violence, the right to be admitted to or participate
 in a guidance program, an apprenticeship  training  program,  on-the-job
 training  program,  executive  training  program,  or other occupational
 training or retraining program;
  (c) To discriminate against any person in [his or her] pursuit of such
 programs or to discriminate against such a person in the  terms,  condi-
 tions  or  privileges  of  such  programs because of race, creed, color,
 national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual  orientation,
 gender  identity  or  expression,  military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT,
 age, disability, familial status, marital status, or status as a  victim
 of domestic violence;
  (d)  To  print  or  circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any
 statement, advertisement or publication, or to use any form of  applica-
 tion  for  such  programs or to make any inquiry in connection with such
 program which expresses, directly or indirectly, any  limitation,  spec-
 ification  or  discrimination as to race, creed, color, national origin,
 citizenship or immigration status, sexual orientation,  gender  identity
 or  expression,  military  status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, age, disability,
 familial status, marital status, or  status  as  a  victim  of  domestic
 violence, or any intention to make any such limitation, specification or
 discrimination, unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification.
  (E)  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION RELATING TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN ACTION BY AN EMPLOYER, LABOR ORGANIZATION, EMPLOY-
 MENT AGENCY OR ANY JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CONTROLLING  APPREN-
 TICE  TRAINING  PROGRAMS  BASED ON A PERSON'S HEIGHT OR WEIGHT WHEN SUCH
 ACTION IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION. NOTHING IN THIS  SUBDI-
 VISION  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO  PREVENT ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS REASONABLY
 TAKEN BY AN EMPLOYER, LABOR ORGANIZATION, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY OR ANY JOINT
 LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CONTROLLING APPRENTICE TRAINING  PROGRAMS  TO
 ALLOW  PERSONS WHO DO NOT MEET PROGRAMMATIC HEIGHT OR WEIGHT CRITERIA TO
 PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUISITES AND/OR NORMAL OPERATIONS OF A  GUIDANCE

 TION, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY OR ANY JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CONTROL-
 LING  APPRENTICE  TRAINING  PROGRAMS'  ACTION  IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW OR
 REGULATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, IT SHALL  BE  AN  AFFIRMATIVE
 DEFENSE  THAT AN ACTION WAS TAKEN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO AVAILABLE ALTER-
 NATIVE ACTIONS THE ENTITY COULD HAVE TAKEN THAT  COULD  HAVE  REASONABLY
 ALLOWED  THE  PERSON  TO  PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUISITES AND/OR NORMAL
 OPERATIONS OF THE GUIDANCE  PROGRAM,  APPRENTICESHIP  TRAINING  PROGRAM,
 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING PROGRAM, EXECUTIVE TRAINING  PROGRAM, OR OTHER OCCU-
 PATIONAL TRAINING OR RETRAINING PROGRAM.

 executive law, paragraph (a) as separately amended by chapters  202  and

 the laws of 2000, are amended and a new paragraph (f) is added  to  read
 as follows:
  (a)  It  shall  be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person,
 being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent  or
 employee  of  any  place  of  public accommodation, resort or amusement,
 because of the race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, marital status, or  status
 as a victim of domestic violence, of any person, directly or indirectly,
 to  refuse,  withhold  from  or  deny to such person any of the accommo-
 dations, advantages, facilities or  privileges  thereof,  including  the
 extension  of credit, or, directly or indirectly, to publish, circulate,
 issue, display, post or  mail  any  written  or  printed  communication,
 notice  or  advertisement, to the effect that any of the accommodations,
 advantages, facilities  and  privileges  of  any  such  place  shall  be
 refused,  withheld  from  or  denied  to  any person on account of race,
 creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual
 orientation,  gender  identity  or  expression,  military  status,  sex,
 HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,  disability or marital status, or that the patronage or
 custom thereat of any person of or purporting to be  of  any  particular
 race,  creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status,
 sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, military status,  sex
 or marital status, or having a disability is unwelcome, objectionable or
 not acceptable, desired or solicited.
  (b)  Nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall be construed to prevent the
 barring of any person, because of the sex of such person, from places of
 public accommodation, resort or amusement  if  the  division  grants  an
 exemption  based on bona fide considerations of public policy; nor shall
 this subdivision apply to the rental of rooms in a housing accommodation
 which restricts such rental to individuals of one sex.  NOTHING IN  THIS
 SUBDIVISION  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO PREVENT THE BARRING OF ANY PERSON,
 BECAUSE OF HEIGHT OR WEIGHT OF SUCH PERSON, FROM PLACES OF AMUSEMENT FOR
 PURPOSES OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY  REASONABLE  AMUSEMENT  INDUSTRY  SAFETY
 STANDARDS.
  (F)  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION RELATING TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN ACTION BY ANY PERSON,  BEING  THE  OWNER,  LESSEE,
 PROPRIETOR,  MANAGER,  SUPERINTENDENT, AGENT OR EMPLOYEE OF ANY PLACE OF

 ER,  SUPERINTENDENT,  AGENT OR EMPLOYEE OF ANY PLACE OF  PUBLIC ACCOMMO-
 DATION, RESORT OR AMUSEMENT, ACTION IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW OR REGULATION
 AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, IT SHALL BE AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE  THAT

 PERSON TO USE OR ENJOY THE ACCOMMODATIONS, ADVANTAGES, SERVICES, FACILI-
 TIES, OR PRIVILEGES OF THE PLACE OR PROVIDER OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION.

 statement,  advertisement or publication, or to use any form of applica-

 accommodation,  land  or commercial space, in the granting, withholding,
 extending or renewing, or in the fixing of the rates,  terms  or  condi-
 tions of, any such credit;

 ing, or in the fixing of the rates, terms or conditions of, any form  of

  This paragraph shall not apply to any situation where  the  use  of  a
 surname would constitute or result in a criminal act.
  2. Without limiting the generality of subdivision one of this section,
 it  shall  be considered discriminatory if, because of an applicant's or
 class of applicants' race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or
 immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity  or  expression,
 military  status,  age, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, marital status, status as a
 victim of domestic violence, disability,  or  familial  status,  (i)  an

 other  applicants  of like overall credit worthiness are granted credit,
 or (ii) special requirements or conditions, such as  requiring  co-obli-
 gors  or  reapplication  upon marriage, are imposed upon an applicant or
 class  of  applicants  in  circumstances  where  similar requirements or
 conditions are not imposed upon other applicants of like overall  credit
 worthiness.
  3.  It  shall  not  be  considered  discriminatory if credit differen-
 tiations or decisions are based upon  factually  supportable,  objective
 differences  in applicants' overall credit worthiness, which may include
 reference to such factors as current income,  assets  and  prior  credit
 history  of  such applicants, as well as reference to any other relevant
 factually supportable data; provided, however, that  no  creditor  shall
 consider, in evaluating the credit worthiness of an applicant, aggregate
 statistics  or  assumptions  relating  to  race,  creed, color, national
 origin, citizenship or immigration status,  sexual  orientation,  gender
 identity  or  expression,  military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, marital
 status, status as a victim of domestic violence or disability, or to the
 likelihood of any group of persons bearing or rearing children,  or  for
 that reason receiving diminished or interrupted income in the future.
  §  8.  Subdivision 2 and paragraph b of subdivision 3 of section 296-c
 of the executive law, subdivision 2 as separately  amended  by  chapters
 202 and 748 of the laws of 2022, paragraphs a, b, and c of subdivision 2
 and  paragraph  b of subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 305 of the laws
 of 2023, are amended to read as follows:
  2. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to:
  a. refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from  internship
 an intern or to discriminate against such intern in terms, conditions or
 privileges of employment as an intern because of the intern's age, race,
 creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual
 orientation,  gender  identity  or  expression,  military  status,  sex,
 HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics,  mari-
 tal status, or status as a victim of domestic violence;
  b. discriminate against an intern in receiving, classifying, disposing
 or  otherwise  acting  upon  applications for internships because of the
 intern's age, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic char-
 acteristics, marital status, or status as a victim of domestic violence;
  c.  print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any state-
 ment, advertisement or publication, or to use any  form  of  application
 for  employment  as  an intern or to make any inquiry in connection with
 prospective employment, which  expresses  directly  or  indirectly,  any
 limitation,  specification  or  discrimination  as  to age, race, creed,
 color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orien-
 tation, gender identity or expression,  military  status,  sex,  HEIGHT,
 WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status
 or  status  as  a victim of domestic violence, or any intent to make any
 such limitation, specification or discrimination, unless  based  upon  a
 bona  fide  occupational  qualification; provided, however, that neither
 this paragraph nor any provision of this chapter or other law  shall  be
 construed  to prohibit the department of civil service or the department
 of personnel of any city containing more than one county from requesting
 information from applicants for civil service  internships  or  examina-
 tions  concerning  any of the aforementioned characteristics, other than
 sexual orientation, for the purpose of conducting  studies  to  identify
 and  resolve  possible problems in recruitment and testing of members of
 A. 7170--B  12
 
 minority groups to ensure the fairest possible and  equal  opportunities
 for  employment in the civil service for all persons, regardless of age,
 race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration  status,
 sexual  orientation,  military  status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability,
 predisposing genetic characteristics, marital  status  or  status  as  a
 victim of domestic violence;
  d.  to  discharge,  expel or otherwise discriminate against any person
 [because he or she] WHO has opposed any practices forbidden  under  this
 article  or  [because he or she] WHO has filed a complaint, testified or
 assisted in any proceeding under this article; [or]
  e. to compel an intern who is pregnant to take  a  leave  of  absence,
 unless  the  intern  is  prevented by such pregnancy from performing the
 activities involved in the job or occupation in a reasonable  manner[.];
 OR
  F.  THE  PROVISIONS  OF THIS SUBDIVISION RELATING TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN ACTION BY AN EMPLOYER BASED ON A  PERSON'S  HEIGHT
 OR  WEIGHT  WHEN  SUCH  ACTION IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION.
 NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED  TO  PREVENT  ALTERNATIVE
 ACTIONS REASONABLY TAKEN BY AN EMPLOYER TO ALLOW PERSONS WHO DO NOT MEET
 HEIGHT  OR  WEIGHT  CRITERIA  TO PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUISITES AND/OR
 NORMAL OPERATIONS OF AN INTERNSHIP.  IN INSTANCES WHERE AN  EMPLOYER  IS
 NOT  REQUIRED  BY  LAW  OR REGULATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, IT
 SHALL BE AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE THAT AN ACTION WAS TAKEN  BECAUSE  THERE
 WERE NO AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS THE EMPLOYER COULD HAVE TAKEN THAT
 COULD HAVE REASONABLY ALLOWED THE PERSON TO PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL REQUI-
 SITES AND/OR NORMAL OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNSHIP.
  b.  subject  an  intern  to  unwelcome  harassment  based on age, sex,
 HEIGHT, WEIGHT, race, creed, color, sexual orientation, gender  identity
 or expression, military status, disability, predisposing genetic charac-
 teristics,  marital  status,  status  as  a victim of domestic violence,
 national origin, or citizenship or immigration  status,  or  where  such
 harassment  has  the  purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
 the intern's work performance by creating an intimidating,  hostile,  or
 offensive working environment.
  §  9.  Section  292  of the executive law is amended by adding two new
 subdivisions 42 and 43 to read as follows:
  42. THE TERM "WEIGHT" MEANS A  NUMERICAL  MEASUREMENT  OF  TOTAL  BODY
 WEIGHT,  THE RATIO OF A PERSON'S WEIGHT IN RELATION TO HEIGHT, THE RATIO
 OF A PERSON'S WEIGHT IN RELATION TO ANY MEASUREMENT OR MEASUREMENTS,  OR
 AN INDIVIDUAL'S UNIQUE PHYSICAL COMPOSITION OF WEIGHT THROUGH BODY SIZE,
 SHAPE  AND  PROPORTIONS. WEIGHT INCLUDES MEASUREMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL BODY
 COMPONENTS, SUCH AS WAIST, HIP, OR CHEST AND  ANY  RATIO  OF  SUCH  BODY
 MEASUREMENTS.  WEIGHT  ENCOMPASSES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, AN IMPRESSION
 OF A PERSON AS FAT OR THIN REGARDLESS OF NUMERICAL MEASUREMENT. AN INDI-
 VIDUAL'S BODY SIZE, SHAPE PROPORTIONS, AND  COMPOSITION  MAY  MAKE  THEM
 APPEAR FAT OR THIN REGARDLESS OF NUMERICAL WEIGHT.
  43.  THE  TERM  "HEIGHT"  MEANS  A NUMERICAL MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL BODY
 HEIGHT, THE EXPRESSION OF A PERSON'S HEIGHT IN RELATION TO  WEIGHT,  THE
 RATIO  OF  A  PERSON'S HEIGHT IN RELATION TO ANY MEASUREMENT OR MEASURE-
 MENTS, OR AN INDIVIDUAL'S UNIQUE PHYSICAL COMPOSITION OF HEIGHT  THROUGH
 BODY  SIZE, SHAPE, OR PROPORTIONS. HEIGHT INCLUDES MEASUREMENTS OF INDI-
 VIDUAL BODY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS LEG, TORSO, ARM, FOOT, AND NECK.  HEIGHT
 ENCOMPASSES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, AN IMPRESSION OF A PERSON AS TALL OR
 SHORT  REGARDLESS  OF  NUMERICAL  MEASUREMENT.  THE LENGTH OF A PERSON'S
 LIMBS IN PROPORTION TO THE PERSON'S BODY MAY CREATE  THE  IMPRESSION  OF
 A. 7170--B  13
 
 THE  PERSON  AS  TALL, SHORT, OR ATYPICALLY PROPORTIONED, INDEPENDENT OF
 NUMERICAL MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT.
  §  10.  This act shall not annul, alter, affect or exempt any employer
 subject to the provisions of this act  from  complying  with  the  laws,
 ordinances,  rules  or regulations of any locality, except to the extent
 that such laws, ordinances, rules or regulations are  inconsistent  with
 any  provision  of  this  act, but no such law, ordinance, rule or regu-
 lation shall be considered inconsistent if it affords equal  or  greater
 protection to the employee.
  §  11.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law. Effective immediately,  the  addition,
 amendment  and/or  repeal  of  any  rule or regulation necessary for the
 implementation of this act on its effective date are  authorized  to  be
 made and completed on or before such effective date.
