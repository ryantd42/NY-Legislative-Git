  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (h) of subdivision  1  of
 section  296 of the executive law, as separately amended by chapters 202

  (a) For an employer or licensing agency, because  of  an  individual's
 age,  race,  creed,  color,  national origin, citizenship or immigration
 status, sexual orientation,  gender  identity  or  expression,  military
 status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic character-
 istics, familial status, marital status, or status as a victim of domes-
 tic violence, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from
 employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in
 compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.
  (b)  For  an  employment agency to discriminate against any individual
 because of age, race, creed,  color,  national  origin,  citizenship  or
 immigration  status,  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
 military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability,  predisposing  genetic

 of domestic violence, in receiving, classifying, disposing or  otherwise
 acting  upon  applications for its services or in referring an applicant

 ual, to exclude or to expel from its membership such  individual  or  to
 discriminate  in  any  way  against  any  of  its members or against any
 employer or any individual employed by an employer.
  (d)  For  any  employer  or employment agency to print or circulate or
 cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publi-
 cation, or to use any form of application for employment or to make  any
 inquiry  in  connection  with  prospective  employment,  which expresses
 directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification or  discrimination
 as  to  age,  race,  creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, predisposing genetic char-
 acteristics, familial status, marital status, or status as a  victim  of
 domestic violence, or any intent to make any such limitation, specifica-
 tion or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qual-
 ification;  provided,  however,  that  neither  this  paragraph  nor any
 provision of this chapter or other law shall be  construed  to  prohibit
 the  department  of  civil service or the department of personnel of any
 city containing more than one county from  requesting  information  from
 applicants  for  civil service examinations concerning any of the afore-
 mentioned  characteristics,  other  than  sexual  orientation,  for  the
 purpose  of conducting studies to identify and resolve possible problems
 in recruitment and testing of members of minority groups to  ensure  the
 fairest  possible  and  equal  opportunities for employment in the civil
 service for all persons, regardless of age, race, creed, color, national
 origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orientation or  gender
 identity  or expression, military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disabili-
 ty, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial  status,  or  marital
 status.
  (h)  For  an  employer,  licensing  agency, employment agency or labor
 organization to subject any individual to harassment because of an indi-
 vidual's age, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary  status,  sex,  HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,  disability,  predisposing genetic
 characteristics, familial status, marital status, status as a victim  of
 domestic  violence,  or because the individual has opposed any practices
 forbidden under this article or  because  the  individual  has  filed  a
 complaint,  testified  or assisted in any proceeding under this article,
 regardless of whether such harassment  would  be  considered  severe  or
 pervasive  under precedent applied to harassment claims. Such harassment
 is an unlawful discriminatory practice when it subjects an individual to
 inferior terms, conditions or privileges of employment  because  of  the
 individual's  membership  in  one or more of these protected categories.
 The fact that such individual did not make a complaint about the harass-
 ment to such employer, licensing  agency,  employment  agency  or  labor
 organization  shall  not  be  determinative  of  whether  such employer,
 licensing agency, employment  agency  or  labor  organization  shall  be
 liable. Nothing in this section shall imply that an employee must demon-
 strate  the  existence of an individual to whom the employee's treatment
 must be compared. It shall be an affirmative defense to liability  under
 this  subdivision  that  the  harassing  conduct does not rise above the
 level of what a  reasonable  victim  of  discrimination  with  the  same
 protected characteristic or characteristics would consider petty slights
 or trivial inconveniences.
  §  2. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision 1-a of section 296 of
 the executive law, as separately amended by chapters 202 and 748 of  the
 laws of 2022, are amended to read as follows:
 A. 7170  3
 
  (b)  To  deny  to  or withhold from any person because of race, creed,
 color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orien-
 tation, gender identity or expression,  military  status,  sex,  HEIGHT,
 WEIGHT, age, disability, familial status, marital status, or status as a
 victim  of domestic violence, the right to be admitted to or participate
 in a guidance program, an apprenticeship  training  program,  on-the-job
 training  program,  executive  training  program,  or other occupational
 training or retraining program;
  (c) To discriminate against any person in his or her pursuit  of  such
 programs  or  to discriminate against such a person in the terms, condi-
 tions or privileges of such programs  because  of  race,  creed,  color,
 national  origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orientation,
 gender identity or expression, military  status,  sex,  HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,
 age,  disability, familial status, marital status, or status as a victim
 of domestic violence;
  (d) To print or circulate or cause to be  printed  or  circulated  any
 statement,  advertisement or publication, or to use any form of applica-
 tion for such programs or to make any inquiry in  connection  with  such
 program  which  expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, spec-
 ification or discrimination as to race, creed, color,  national  origin,
 citizenship  or  immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity
 or expression, military status, sex, HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,  age,  disability,
 familial  status,  marital  status,  or  status  as a victim of domestic
 violence, or any intention to make any such limitation, specification or
 discrimination, unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification.

 being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent  or
 employee  of  any  place  of  public accommodation, resort or amusement,
 because of the race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, disability, marital status, or  status
 as a victim of domestic violence, of any person, directly or indirectly,
 to  refuse,  withhold  from  or  deny to such person any of the accommo-
 dations, advantages, facilities or  privileges  thereof,  including  the
 extension  of credit, or, directly or indirectly, to publish, circulate,
 issue, display, post or  mail  any  written  or  printed  communication,
 notice  or  advertisement, to the effect that any of the accommodations,
 advantages, facilities  and  privileges  of  any  such  place  shall  be
 refused,  withheld  from  or  denied  to  any person on account of race,
 creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual
 orientation,  gender  identity  or  expression,  military  status,  sex,
 HEIGHT,  WEIGHT,  disability or marital status, or that the patronage or

 not acceptable, desired or solicited.
  (b)  Nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall be construed to prevent the

 exemption  based on bona fide considerations of public policy; nor shall
 this subdivision apply to the rental of rooms in a housing accommodation

 BECAUSE OF HEIGHT OR WEIGHT OF SUCH PERSON, FROM PLACES OF AMUSEMENT FOR
 PURPOSES OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY ESTABLISHED STATE, FEDERAL, OR AMUSEMENT
 INDUSTRY SAFETY STANDARD.

 consider, in evaluating the credit worthiness of an applicant, aggregate
 statistics  or  assumptions  relating  to  race,  creed, color, national
 origin, citizenship or immigration status,  sexual  orientation,  gender
 identity  or  expression,  military status, sex, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, marital
 status, status as a victim of domestic violence or disability, or to the

 that reason receiving diminished or interrupted income in the future.

 cants for civil service internships or examinations  concerning  any  of
 the  aforementioned  characteristics, other than sexual orientation, for

 of unreasonably interfering with the intern's work performance by creat-
 ing an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

 subject to the provisions of this act  from  complying  with  the  laws,
 ordinances,  rules  or regulations of any locality, except to the extent
 that such laws, ordinances, rules or regulations are  inconsistent  with
 any  provision  of  this  act, but no such law, ordinance, rule or regu-
 lation shall be considered inconsistent if it affords equal  or  greater
 protection to the employee.
  §  10.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law. Effective immediately,  the  addition,
 amendment  and/or  repeal  of  any  rule or regulation necessary for the
