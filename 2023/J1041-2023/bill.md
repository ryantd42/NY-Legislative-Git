BY: Senator SERRANO
 
  MOURNING  the  death  of Robin Dropkin, unwavering
  champion  of  public  lands  and  environmental
  protection
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
just tribute to the memory of those prominent individuals whose creative
talents  have  contributed  to  the  environmental  and  recreational
enrichment of the citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born in New York City on December 8, 1952, Robin Dropkin's
passion for environmental stewardship began at an early age, fostered by
a love of gardening and a deep knowledge of flora and fauna; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robin  Dropkin  earned  a  bachelor's  degree  from  the
University  of Michigan in 1975 and went on to earn a master's degree in
environmental studies from Antioch University New England in Keene,  New
Hampshire,  to share her commitment to environmental protection with the
next generation of environmental stewards; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2001, Robin Dropkin was named the Executive Director  of
Parks  &  Trails  New  York (PTNY) and transformed the organization into
Albany's leading statewide public lands nonprofit organization, creating
a  legacy  of  advocacy,  outdoor  recreational  opportunities,  and
environmental stewardship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Seeing an opportunity to expand recreational opportunities
while protecting our precious natural spaces, Robin Dropkin launched the
Genesee Valley Greenway Project in 1991 to connect a  dozen  communities
between  Letchworth  State  Park  and the Erie Canal in Rochester, which
spurred an advocacy campaign to create  the  State  Park  Infrastructure
Fund the following year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  early successes, in 1993, Robin Dropkin spearheaded
the report "Preserve & Protect: Challenges Facing New York's State  Park
System,"  the  first  analysis  of the beleaguered conditions facing New
York's state park system, and which led to the organization of the first
Statewide Parks Conference in 1997; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a method of drawing attention to  the  potential  for  a
unique  statewide  asset  in  a  completed, 360-mile Erie Canalway Trail
running from Buffalo to Albany, Robin Dropkin launched "Cycling the Erie
Canal,"  an  eight-day  bicycle  tour  from  Buffalo  to  Albany  that
highlighted the opportunity to create an iconic statewide trail, brought
economic development to communities across New York, and which has given
more  than  10,000 people from all parts of the globe the adventure of a
lifetime; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2006, Robin Dropkin led  the  release  of  "Parks  at  a
Turning  Point,"  a landmark report documenting crumbling infrastructure
at state parks and historic sites which exponentially grew the coalition
advocating for public lands in New York, leading to a capacity  building
grant  program for nonprofits that champion our park and trails in 2008,
 
and the release of the first Economic Impact Study of the New York State
Park System in 2009; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2010, Robin Dropkin and her coalition of park and public
land  advocates  led  the  grassroots fight to prevent the closure of 88
state parks threatened with closure  due  to  budget  constraint,  which
culminated in a successful advocacy campaign securing significant annual
capital  funding for state parks and historic sites which continued into
2015; and
 
  WHEREAS, Decades of advocacy and grassroots development  efforts  by
Parks  &  Trails New York came to fruition in 2020 when the Empire State
Trail was completed, closing gaps on the Erie  Canalway  Trail  and  the
Hudson  River  Valley  Greenway and allowing New York State to boast the
longest state multi-use trail in the nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robin Dropkin continued to lead on a myriad of initiatives,
programs, and  coalition  priorities  that  aimed  to  expand,  steward,
enhance, and improve public access to our iconic state parks system, and
increase  the  opportunities  for  environmental  education  and outdoor
recreation until her passing in early 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, She is survived by her husband, Chip Frank; daughter;  Mara
Simon, and her children, Shoshana and Jacob; and son, Dan Dropkin-Frank;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to publicly
recognize those who have contributed extensively  to  the  environmental
and  recreational  achievements  of  this great Empire State and Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn  the  death  of Robin Dropkin, unwavering champion of public lands
and environmental protection; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Robin Dropkin.
