  COMMEMORATING  the  111th  Anniversary  of  the
  Roosevelt Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proud  to  commemorate  the  111th
Anniversary  of  the Roosevelt Fire Department and to honor its past and
present firefighting members for 111 years of  fire  protection  to  the
citizens of Roosevelt, New York, and its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the past  111
years,  the  courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of  Roosevelt  Fire
Department have valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and
have won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Organized  in  1912,  the  Roosevelt  Fire  Department  is
comprised  of  five  companies,  currently housed in two stations: Alpha
Hook and Ladder Co.  No.  1  the  original  company  of  the  department
organized  in  1900,  when  Roosevelt  was  known  as  Greenwich;  Paint
Emergency Co. No. 1, organized in 1936;  and  Fire  Police  Company  are
housed  in  Headquarters at 56 W, Centennial Avenue, along with Hose and
Engine Co. No. 1 while awaiting the rebuilding of their former  quarters
on  Park Avenue and Hose and Engine Co. No. 3 which will celebrate their
100th Anniversary in May of 2023, is housed on Babylon Turnpike; and
 
  WHEREAS, Roosevelt Fire Department once had an  additional  company,
Russell  Hose  Co.  No.  2,  which was housed at the current location of
Freeport Fire Department, Hose Co. No. 2 on Leonard Avenue;  No.  2  was
organized  before World War I, when the incorporated village of Freeport
only extended as far north as Seamen Avenue; and
 
  WHEREAS, After a petition for annexation was  granted  to  the  area
North of Seaman Avenue in 1922, Protection Hose and Engine Co. No. 3 was
organized to serve the southeast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1923, Roosevelt Fire Department together with Hose Co.
No. 5 of the Freeport Fire Department served the newly annexed  area  of
the  village;  in  that  same  year, Russell Hose Co. was dissolved, and
their members disbursed among the new  Companies  based  on  where  they
lived,  with  Russell's  firehouse sold to Hose Co. No. 5 as their first
quarters; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 18 charter members of Protection Hose  and  Engine  Co.
No. 3 built their own quarters at the current location of the Company on
Babylon Turnpike; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alpha  Hook  and Ladder Co. No. 1, also known as Truck Co.
No. 1, was originally housed in their own building on Debevoise  Avenue,
prior  to the building of Roosevelt Fire Department's prior headquarters
in 1929; the current headquarters  was  opened  in  2005,  on  the  same
Centennial Avenue site as the original building; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the original apparatus room of Hose and Engine Co. No.
3's  first  firehouse  became  too  small  for  larger  engines,  a  new
 
cinderblock  apparatus  room was added to the original frame welding and
opened in 1953, with the original converted into a much  larger  company
meeting room; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the eve of Martin Luther King Jr.  Day in 1991, a fire
that began with the audible alarm controls heavily damaged the  original
building,  but  fortunately,  spared  the  apparatus  housed  in  the
cinderblock addition; the cinderblock apparatus  room  was  subsequently
found  to  be  able to support a second story, so the original firehouse
was torn down to create adequate parking, and an extended  second  story
was added for new meeting and social rooms; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  the  Roosevelt Fire Department is comprised of
approximately 44 members who are all volunteer firefighters or Emergency
Medical  Technicians;  each  Company  has  a  captain  and  one  or  two
lieutenants,  who with the three chiefs constitute the leadership of the
department headed by Chief Hector Tyler Jr.; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the years we have had many dedicated members, with our
membership evolving as our community did;  the  first  African  American
members  joined  in  the  1960s, with our first black Chief James Barton
elected in 1980; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1970s, the first women firefighters joined,  and  in
more  recent years, many Latino members, including current 2nd Assistant
Chief, Abner Vasquez; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Notable  members  in  the  Department's  history  include
ex-Chief  Lester  Marks  and  firefighter  John Rogers, who beside being
knowledgeable  active  firefighters,  were  also  Nassau  County  Police
officers,  and together, organized the Nassau County Police Department's
Arson Squad; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ex-Chief Daniel Markham, who became Nassau  County's  first
black  Fire  Marshall,  and Honorary Chiefs Bernard Von Elm of Emergency
Co. and Aloysius Ansert Jr. of Hose and Engine Co. No. 3, who were  both
elected  as  such  for  their long-term dedication and active membership
well into their 70's; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honorary Chief Ansert Jr.  helped  organize  the  New  York
State Volunteer Firemen's home's first Residents Council, and became its
first  Vice  President;  later,  Hose  No.  3 ex-Captain Allison Stewart
become the first Chief of South Farmingdale Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
Roosevelt  Fire  Department in public service and fire protection is one
to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for 365 days a year,  for  111  years,
whenever  the alarm sounded, these noble volunteers left their homes and
went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, The brave firefighters of  Roosevelt  Fire  Department  are
prepared  to risk their lives every day to help save the lives of others
and to protect homes and property from the destruction caused  by  fire;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by individual firefighters, the Roosevelt Fire Department  reflects  the
history and development of firefighting over the past 111 years; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities, and  acknowledge  publicly  the  heroic
good  works  performed  by  the volunteer fire departments of this great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate the 111th Anniversary of Roosevelt Fire Department;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Roosevelt Fire Department.
