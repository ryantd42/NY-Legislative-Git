 RESIDENCE throughout the credit period. In allocating a dollar amount of
 credit  to  any  building, the commissioner shall specify the applicable
 percentage and the maximum qualified  basis  which  may  be  taken  into
 account under this article with respect to such building. The applicable
 percentage  and  the  maximum qualified basis with respect to a building
 shall not exceed the amounts determined in  subdivisions  one  and  six,
 respectively, of section twenty-one of this article.
