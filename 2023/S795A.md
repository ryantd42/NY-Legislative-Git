 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation  to  enacting  the
  "consumer and small business protection act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "consumer
 and small business protection act (CSPA)".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and intent. The Legislature declares that
 the State has a responsibility to  protect  individuals  and  businesses
 within  the  State  from unfair and abusive business acts and practices.
 The Legislature further declares that the  State's  law,  which  guarded
 only  against  deceptive  business acts and practices, has been insuffi-
 cient to meet this responsibility and has become out of  date  as  other
 states'  laws provide far greater protections. Consumers and small busi-
 nesses have long been vulnerable to unscrupulous business practices that
 are unfair and abusive without being expressly deceptive. The State must
 not allow bad actors to peddle predatory products and services  as  long
 as  they  are clever enough not to get caught in a lie. To that end, and
 to better level the playing field for  the  State's  many  honest  busi-
 nesses,  this  legislation defines unfair and abusive acts and practices
 expansively.
  The State must also ensure that this  protection  covers  small  busi-
 nesses, which are frequent targets of predatory loans and other forms of

 exploitation,  along  with  all  consumer transactions. This legislation
 therefore rejects the limitation, imposed  by  courts,  that  prohibited
 conduct  be  "consumer oriented," have an impact on the public at large,
 or  be  part  of  a  broader pattern. Consumers and small businesses are
 entitled to redress whenever they are harmed by  deceptive,  unfair,  or
 abusive conduct.
  For  any  of these protections to be meaningful, the State must ensure
 that the remedies for prohibited conduct provide an effective deterrent.
 This legislation therefore updates the statutory damages for  violations
 for the first time in decades, from $50 to $1,000, and allows meaningful
 punitive  damages  for  particularly egregious behavior. The Legislature
 recognizes that unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices have a  partic-
 ular  impact on poor individuals, people of color, and those affected by
 natural disasters and health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandem-
 ic. For this reason, the State must ensure that  limited  resources  not
 prevent  individuals  and  small  businesses from seeking remedies. This
 legislation therefore opens access to  justice  by  making  recovery  of
 attorney's  fees  mandatory  for  a prevailing plaintiff and authorizing
 class actions.
  § 3. Section 349 of the general business law, as added by  chapter  43
 of  the  laws  of 1970, subdivision (h) as amended by chapter 157 of the
 laws of 1984, and subdivision (j) as added by section 6 of  part  HH  of
 chapter 55 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
  §  349.  [Deceptive acts] UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS and prac-
 tices unlawful. (a) [Deceptive] ANY UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE acts or
 practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce  or  in  the
 furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful.
  (1)  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT OR PRACTICE IS UNFAIR
 WHEN IT CAUSES OR IS LIKELY TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL INJURY, THE  INJURY  IS
 NOT  REASONABLY  AVOIDABLE, AND THE INJURY IS NOT OUTWEIGHED BY COUNTER-
 VAILING BENEFITS.
  (2) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT OR  PRACTICE  IS  ABUSIVE
 WHEN:
  (I)  IT  MATERIALLY  INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF A PERSON TO UNDER-
 STAND A TERM OR CONDITION OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE; OR
  (II) TAKES UNREASONABLE ADVANTAGE OF:
  (A) A PERSON'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATERIAL RISKS, COSTS,  OR
 CONDITIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE; OR
  (B) A PERSON'S INABILITY TO PROTECT SUCH PERSON'S INTERESTS IN SELECT-
 ING OR USING A PRODUCT OR SERVICE.
  (b)  Whenever  the attorney general shall believe from evidence satis-
 factory to [him] THE ATTORNEY GENERAL that any person, firm, corporation
 or association or agent or employee thereof has engaged in or  is  about
 to  engage in any of the acts or practices stated to be UNFAIR, unlawful
 [he], DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL may bring an action  in
 the  name and on behalf of the people of the state of New York to enjoin
 such unlawful acts or practices and to obtain restitution of any  moneys
 or property obtained directly or indirectly by any such unlawful acts or
 practices.  In such action preliminary relief may be granted under arti-
 cle sixty-three of the civil practice law and rules.  SUCH ACTIONS  MAY
 BE  BROUGHT  REGARDLESS  OF  WHETHER  OR NOT THE UNDERLYING VIOLATION IS
 DIRECTED AT INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES, IS CONSUMER-ORIENTED, OR INVOLVES
 THE OFFERING OF GOODS, SERVICES, OR PROPERTY  FOR  PERSONAL,  FAMILY  OR
 HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES.
  (c) Before any violation of this section is sought to be enjoined, the
 attorney  general shall be required to give the person against whom such
 S. 795--A  3
 
 proceeding is contemplated notice by certified mail and  an  opportunity
 to show in writing within five business days after receipt of notice why
 proceedings  should  not be instituted against [him] SUCH PERSON, unless
 the  attorney general shall find, in any case in which [he] THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL seeks preliminary relief, that to give such notice and  opportu-
 nity is not in the public interest.
  (d)  In any such action it shall be a complete defense that the act or
 practice is, or if in interstate  commerce  would  be,  subject  to  and
 complies  with  the  rules and regulations of, and the statutes adminis-
 tered by, the federal trade commission or any official department, divi-
 sion, commission or agency of the United States  as  such  rules,  regu-
 lations  or  statutes are interpreted by the federal trade commission or
 such department, division, commission or agency or the federal courts.
  (e) Nothing in this section shall apply to  any  television  or  radio
 broadcasting  station  or  to  any  publisher or printer of a newspaper,
 magazine or other form of printed OR  DIGITAL  advertising,  who  broad-
 casts, publishes, or prints the advertisement.

 ABUSIVE acts or practices [declared to  be  unlawful],  whether  or  not
 subject  to  any other law of this state, and shall not supersede, amend
 or repeal any other law of this state under which the  attorney  general
 is authorized to take any action or conduct any inquiry.
  (h)  (1)  In  addition  to the right of action granted to the attorney
 general pursuant to this section, any person who  has  been  injured  by
 reason  of  any  violation  of this section may bring an action in [his]

 action  to  recover  [his  actual damages or fifty dollars, whichever is
