 AN ACT to amend the state technology  law,  in  relation  to  blockchain
  technology and smart contracts
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 302 of the  state  technology  law  is  amended  by
 adding two new subdivisions 6 and 7 to read as follows:

 THAT USES A DISTRIBUTED, DECENTRALIZED, SHARED  AND  REPLICATED  LEDGER,
 WHICH MAY BE PUBLIC, PERMISSIONED OR PERMISSIONLESS, OR DRIVEN BY TOKEN-
 IZED  CRYPTO ECONOMICS OR TOKENLESS. THE DATA ON THE LEDGER IS PROTECTED
 WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY, IS IMMUTABLE AND AUDITABLE AND PROVIDES AN UNCENSORED
 TRUTH.
  7. "SMART CONTRACT" SHALL MEAN AN EVENT-DRIVEN PROGRAM THAT RUNS ON  A
 DISTRIBUTED,  DECENTRALIZED,  SHARED  AND REPLICATED LEDGER AND THAT CAN
 TAKE CUSTODY OVER AND INSTRUCT TRANSFER OF ASSETS ON THAT LEDGER.
