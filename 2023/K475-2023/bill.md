  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  December 12, 2023, as Poinsettia Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  celebrate  and
recognize the poinsettia and the beauty and pleasure the flowering plant
has brought to the residents of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim December 12, 2023, as
Poinsettia Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  National
Poinsettia Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  vibrant red, and sometimes green or white, poinsettia
symbolizes the Christmas season and the miracle  it  represents  in  the
United States and other countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Poinsettias are the best-selling potted flowering plant in
the United States, with the  majority  of  the  plant's  abundant  sales
happening during the six weeks before Christmas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A nationally treasured flower, the name poinsettia emerged
after the United States botanist,  Joel  Roberts  Poinsett,  became  the
first  United  States  ambassador  to  Mexico;  in  1826, the Ambassador
discovered the eye-catching plant and  sent  some  back  to  the  United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  time,  Joel  Poinsett  and  his  team  successfully
cultivated poinsettias at his South  Carolina  greenhouses;  today,  the
plant  is  now  bred into dozens of different colors and shapes and is a
vital product in the Nation's economy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Poinsettias are part of the Euphorbiaceae or Spurge  family
and  there are more than 100 varieties in colors such as the traditional
red, white, pink, burgundy, marbled, and speckled; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Paul Ecke Ranch in California grows over 70 percent  of
all  poinsettias  purchased  in  the  United  states  and also covers 50
percent of the world-wide sales; and
 
  WHEREAS, Poinsettia Day in New York  State  is  meant  to  call  for
awareness  of  and recognition of the importance of the poinsettia plant
to New York's heritage and economy; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim December 12, 2023, as
Poinsettia Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  National
Poinsettia Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
