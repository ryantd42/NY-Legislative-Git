  §  3.  Paragraph  1 of subsection (f) of section 3420 of the insurance
 law, as amended by section 19 of part III of chapter 59 of the  laws  of

  (1)  No  policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed
 by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising
 out of the ownership, maintenance and use  of  a  motor  vehicle  or  an
 altered  motor  vehicle  commonly  referred  to as a "stretch limousine"
 having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in the  busi-
 ness  of  carrying  or  transporting passengers for hire, by the insured
 shall be issued or delivered by any authorized insurer  upon  any  motor
 vehicle  or  an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a "stretch
 limousine" having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in
 the business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire, then prin-
 cipally garaged or principally used in this state unless it  contains  a
 provision whereby the insurer agrees that it will pay to the insured, as
 defined in such provision, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
 therein  to be prescribed by the board of directors of the Motor Vehicle
 Accident Indemnification Corporation and approved by the superintendent,

 accident,  which  the insured or his legal representative shall be enti-
 tled to recover as damages from an owner or  operator  of  an  uninsured
 motor  vehicle,  unidentified motor vehicle which leaves the scene of an
 accident, a motor vehicle registered in this state as to  which  at  the

 cle  shall  diminish  the  obligations  of the insurer under this policy

 excess  of  basic  economic  loss.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent
 provisions of section three thousand four hundred  twenty-five  of  this
 article, any such policy which does not contain the aforesaid provisions
 shall be construed as if such provisions were embodied therein.
  § 4. Subparagraph (A) of paragraph 2 of subsection (f) of section 3420
 of the insurance law, as amended by section 19 of part III of chapter 59
 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (A)  Any such policy shall, at the option of the insured, also provide
 supplementary  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  for  bodily
 injury,  in an amount up to the bodily injury liability insurance limits
 of coverage provided under such policy, subject  to  a  maximum  of  two
 hundred  fifty  thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of
 one person in any one accident  and,  subject  to  such  limit  for  one
 person,  up to five hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury to
 or death of two or more persons in  any  one  accident,  or  a  combined
 single  limit  policy of five hundred thousand dollars because of bodily
 injury to or death of one or more persons in any one accident;  and  any
 such  policy  insuring  against loss resulting from liability imposed by
 law for bodily injury or death suffered by any  natural  person  arising
 out  of  the ownership, maintenance, and use of an altered motor vehicle
 commonly referred to as a "stretch limousine" having a seating  capacity
 of  eight  or more passengers used in the business of carrying or trans-
 porting  passengers  for  hire,  shall  provide  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  for  bodily  injury, in an
 amount of a combined single limit of one million five  hundred  thousand
 dollars  because of bodily injury or death of one or more persons in any
 one accident. Provided however, an  insurer  issuing  any  such  policy,
 except  a  policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed
 by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising
 out of the ownership, maintenance, and use of an altered  motor  vehicle
 commonly  referred to as a "stretch limousine" having a seating capacity
 of eight or more passengers used in the business of carrying  or  trans-
 porting  passengers  for  hire,  in  lieu of offering to the insured the
 coverages stated above, may provide supplementary uninsured/underinsured

 injury  liability insurance limits of coverage provided under such poli-
 cy, subject to a maximum of one  hundred  thousand  dollars  because  of
 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject
 to  such  limit  for  one  person,  up to three hundred thousand dollars
 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in  any  one
 accident,  or  a  combined single limit policy of three hundred thousand
 dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one or more  persons  in
 any  one  accident,  if  such  insurer  also  makes available a personal
 umbrella policy with liability coverage  limits  up  to  at  least  five
 hundred  thousand dollars which also provides coverage for supplementary
 A. 3648  4
 
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  claims.  Supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  shall provide coverage, in
 any state or Canadian province, if the limits  of  liability  under  all
 bodily  injury  liability  bonds and insurance policies of another motor
 vehicle liable for damages INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO A  VEHICLE  FOR
 WHICH  THE  POLICY OF INSURANCE HAS BEEN RESCINDED OR CANCELLED PURSUANT
 TO SECTION THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX-A OF THIS  ARTICLE,  A
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  INVOLVED  IN  AN ACCIDENT WHICH WAS STAGED TO DEFRAUD AN
 INSURER, EXCEPT SUCH VEHICLE OWNED AND OPERATED BY  THE  PERPETRATOR  OR
 PERPETRATORS  OF  SUCH  ACCIDENT, are in a lesser amount than the bodily
 injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided by  such  policy.
 Upon  written  request  by  any  insured  covered  by  supplemental
 uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance or his duly authorized repre-
 sentative and upon disclosure by the insured  of  the  insured's  bodily
 injury  and  supplemental  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance
 coverage limits, the insurer of any other owner or operator  of  another
 motor  vehicle  against  which  a claim has been made for damages to the
 insured shall disclose, within forty-five days of the request, the bodi-
 ly injury liability insurance limits of its coverage provided under  the
 policy  or all bodily injury liability bonds. The time of the insured to
 make any supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist claim,  shall  be
 tolled  during  the period the insurer of any other owner or operator of
 another motor vehicle that may be liable for  damages  to  the  insured,
 fails to so disclose its coverage. As a condition precedent to the obli-
 gation  of  the  insurer  to  pay  under  the  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  coverage,  the  limits  of
 liability  of  all  bodily  injury liability bonds or insurance policies
 applicable at the time of the accident shall be exhausted by payment  of
 judgments or settlements.
  §  5.  Paragraph  1 of subsection (b) of section 5103 of the insurance
 law is amended to read as follows:

 TWENTY-SIX-A OF THE INSURANCE LAW, NO contract of insurance for which  a

 after  mailing to the named insured at the address shown on the policy a

 A. 3648  5
 
 notice of cancellation by the insurer  shall  be  sufficient,  provided,
 however,  if  another  insurance  contract has been procured, such other
 insurance contract shall, as of its effective date and  hour,  terminate
 the  insurance  previously  in effect with respect to any motor vehicles
 designated in both contracts. No  contract  of  insurance  for  which  a
 certificate of insurance has been filed with the commissioner in which a
 natural  person  is  the  named  insured  and  the motor vehicle is used
 predominantly for non-business  purposes  shall  be  non-renewed  by  an
 insurer  unless  at  least  forty-five,  but not more than sixty days in
 advance of the renewal date the insurer mails or delivers to  the  named
 insured  at  the  address  shown  on  the policy a written notice of its
 intention not to renew. No such contract of insurance in which the named
 insured is not a natural person or the motor vehicle  is  used  predomi-
 nantly  for  business purposes shall be non-renewed by an insurer unless
 at least twenty days in advance of the renewal date the insurer mails or
 delivers to the named insured at the address shown on the policy a writ-
 ten notice of its intention not to renew.  All  notices  of  non-renewal
 shall  be  sent  by regular mail with a certificate of mailing, properly
 endorsed by the postal service to be obtained.  Time  of  the  effective

 any cause whatsoever sent to the insured shall include in type of  which
 the  face  shall not be smaller than twelve point a statement that proof
 of financial security is required to be maintained continuously through-
 out the registration period and a notice prescribed by the  commissioner
 indicating  the punitive effects of failure to maintain continuous proof
 of financial security and actions which may be taken by the  insured  to
 avoid such punitive effects.
