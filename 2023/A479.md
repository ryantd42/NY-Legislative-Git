  §  18-100.  DEFINITIONS.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "RANKED CHOICE
 VOTING METHOD" SHALL MEAN A METHOD OF CASTING AND TABULATING VOTES  THAT
 SIMULATES  THE BALLOT COUNTS THAT WOULD OCCUR IF ALL VOTERS PARTICIPATED
 IN A SERIES OF RUNOFF ELECTIONS, WHEREBY THE VOTERS RANK  CANDIDATES  BY
 PREFERENCE  AND,  IF NO CANDIDATE HAS RECEIVED A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST,
 THEN THE CANDIDATE WITH THE FEWEST FIRST CHOICE VOTES IS ELIMINATED  AND
 THE  REMAINING  CANDIDATES  ADVANCE  TO ANOTHER COUNTING ROUND. IN EVERY
 ROUND, EACH BALLOT IS COUNTED AS ONE VOTE FOR THE HIGHEST RANKED ADVANC-
 ING CANDIDATE. THE PROCESS SHALL BE REPEATED UNTIL TWO CANDIDATES REMAIN
 ON THE BALLOT. THE FINAL TWO CANDIDATES SHALL  ADVANCE  TO  THE  GENERAL
 ELECTION.
  §  18-102.  RANKED  CHOICE  VOTING  METHOD  FOR  NONPARTISAN  PRIMARY

 EXCLUDING  THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, HELD IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWEN-
 TY-FIVE AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, UTILIZING  THE  RANKED  CHOICE  VOTING
 METHOD.
  2.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL APPLY ONLY WHEN MORE THAN TWO
 CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN NOMINATED OR DESIGNATED FOR AN OFFICE ENUMERATED IN
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.
  § 18-104. PROCEDURES. 1. ALL REGISTERED VOTERS OTHERWISE QUALIFIED  TO
 VOTE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE IN THE
 PRIMARY ELECTION REGARDLESS OF SUCH VOTER'S POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION.
  2.  ANY PERSON WHO MEETS THE PRIMARY ELECTION QUALIFICATIONS MAY PETI-
 TION AS A CANDIDATE IN SUCH PRIMARY ELECTION AS A MEMBER OF THE PARTY IN

  3. ALL CANDIDATES FOR A GIVEN OFFICE  SHALL  BE  LISTED  ON  A  SINGLE

 METHOD,  THE  BALLOT  SHALL BE SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND ALLOW A
 VOTER TO RANK CANDIDATES FOR AN OFFICE BASED ON PREFERENCE. IF FEASIBLE,

 CHOICE VOTING METHOD.
  2.  INSTRUCTIONS  ON  THE  BALLOT  SHALL  CONFORM SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE
 FOLLOWING SPECIFICATIONS, ALTHOUGH SUBJECT  TO  MODIFICATION,  BASED  ON
 BALLOT DESIGN AND VOTING MACHINE:
  "VOTE  FOR  CANDIDATES  BY  INDICATING YOUR FIRST-CHOICE CANDIDATES IN

 "1"  BESIDE A CANDIDATE'S NAME, YOUR SECOND CHOICE BY MARKING THE NUMBER
 "2" BESIDE A CANDIDATE'S NAME, YOUR THIRD CHOICE BY MARKING  THE  NUMBER
 "3"  BESIDE A CANDIDATE'S NAME, YOUR FOURTH CHOICE BY MARKING THE NUMBER
 "4" BESIDE A CANDIDATE'S NAME AND  YOUR  FIFTH  CHOICE  BY  MARKING  THE
 NUMBER  "5"  BESIDE  A CANDIDATE'S NAME. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO RANK ONLY ONE
 CANDIDATE, BUT RANKING ADDITIONAL CANDIDATES WILL NOT HURT  THE  CHANCES
 OF  YOUR  FIRST-CHOICE CANDIDATE. YOU MAY NOT RANK MORE THAN FIVE CANDI-
 DATES.  DO NOT MARK THE SAME NUMBER BESIDE MORE THAN ONE  CANDIDATE.  DO
 NOT SKIP NUMBERS."
  3.  A  SAMPLE BALLOT FOR AN OFFICE SUBJECT TO THE RANKED CHOICE VOTING
 METHOD SHALL ILLUSTRATE THE  VOTING  PROCEDURE  FOR  THE  RANKED  CHOICE
 VOTING  METHOD.  SUCH A SAMPLE BALLOT SHALL BE INCLUDED WITH EACH ABSEN-
 TEE BALLOT.
  § 18-108. VOTER EDUCATION. THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL  CONDUCT
 A  VOTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ON THE RANKED CHOICE VOTING SYSTEM TO FAMIL-
 IARIZE VOTERS WITH THE BALLOT DESIGN, METHOD OF VOTING,  AND  ADVANTAGES
 OF DETERMINING A MAJORITY WINNER IN A SINGLE ELECTION.
  §  18-110.  CONSTRUCTION.  ALL  PRIMARY  ELECTIONS  HELD BY THE RANKED
