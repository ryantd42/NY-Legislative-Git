  HONORING  Captain  Gregory  Franklin  upon  the
  occasion of his  designation  as  recipient  of  the
  Pinnacle  Public  Service  Award by the Norwich Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  justly  proud  to  honor  Captain
Gregory  Franklin  upon  the occasion of his designation as recipient of
the Pinnacle Public Service Award by the Norwich Fire Department, to  be
celebrated on Saturday, April 29, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Captain  Gregory  Franklin has consistently demonstrated a
level of commitment, dedication, integrity,  and  professionalism  which
truly exemplifies excellence in the fire service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a steadfast and unwavering commitment to the Norwich
Fire Department for nearly 34 years, Captain Gregory  Franklin  averaged
more  than  3,700  hours  of  service  to  his  department  and  the
community-at-large in 2002; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected men and women are often the  first
to  respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Captain Gregory Franklin is such a firefighter; throughout his years  of
devoted  service,  he heroically performed, above and beyond the call of
duty, those responsibilities which define the task of  fire  protection;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Captain Gregory Franklin upon the occasion of his  designation  as
recipient  of  the  Pinnacle  Public  Service  Award by the Norwich Fire
Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Captain Gregory Franklin.
