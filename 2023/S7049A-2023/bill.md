 COSTS ARE NOT QUALIFYING HEALTH CARE COSTS TO BE PAID FROM THE FUND IN A
 REASONABLY PROMPT PERIOD OF TIME.
  §  3.  Subdivision  5  and  paragraph  (a) of subdivision 6 of section
 2999-i of the public health law, as amended by section 2 of  part  K  of
 chapter 57 of the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  5. For the state fiscal year beginning April first, two thousand elev-
 en  and ending March thirty-first, two thousand twelve, the state fiscal
 year beginning April first, two thousand twelve and ending  March  thir-
 ty-first,  two  thousand  thirteen,  and the state fiscal year beginning
 April first, two thousand thirteen and ending  March  thirty-first,  two
 thousand  fourteen, the superintendent of financial services shall cause
 to be deposited into the fund for  each  such  fiscal  year  the  amount
 appropriated for such purpose. Beginning April first, two thousand four-
 teen  and  annually thereafter, the superintendent of financial services
 or the commissioner, whoever is administering the fund for the  applica-
 ble  period shall cause to be deposited into the fund, subject to avail-
 able appropriations, an amount  equal  to  the  difference  between  the
 amount appropriated to the fund in the preceding fiscal year[,].  BEGIN-
 NING  APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, THE COMMISSIONER OR WHOEVER
 IS ADMINISTERING THE FUND FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD SHALL  CAUSE  TO  BE
 DEPOSITED  INTO  THE FUND AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FUNDING LEVEL NECESSARY
 TO ENSURE THE LIABILITIES OF THE MEDICAL INDEMNITY FUND DO NOT EQUAL  OR
 EXCEED EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FUND'S ASSETS AS DETERMINED IN THE ACTUARI-
 AL  CALCULATION  SET  FORTH  IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION SIX OF THIS
 SECTION, as increased by the adjustment factor  defined  in  subdivision
 seven  of this section[, and the assets of the fund at the conclusion of
 that fiscal year].
  (a) [Following] NO LATER THAN SIXTY DAYS FOLLOWING the deposit  refer-
 enced  in  subdivision  five  of  this  section,  the commissioner shall
 conduct an actuarial calculation of the  estimated  liabilities  of  the
 fund  for  the  coming  year  resulting  from  the  qualified plaintiffs
 enrolled in the fund AND SHALL ALSO CONDUCT QUARTERLY  ACTUARIAL  CALCU-
 LATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PUBLICLY POST ON ITS WEBSITE SUCH ACTUARI-
 AL  CALCULATIONS  WITHIN  THIRTY DAYS OF COMPLETION.  The administrator
 shall from time to time  adjust  such  calculation  in  accordance  with
 subdivision  seven  of  this  section.  If the total of all estimates of
 current liabilities equals or  exceeds  eighty  percent  of  the  fund's
 assets,  then  the fund shall not accept any new enrollments until a new
 deposit has been made pursuant to  subdivision  five  of  this  section,
 PROVIDED HOWEVER, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROVIDE SIXTY DAYS' NOTICE ON ITS
 WEBSITE BEFORE THE FUND SUSPENDS ENROLLMENTS.  When, as a result of such
 new  deposit,  the fund's liabilities no longer exceed eighty percent of
 the fund's assets, the fund administrator  shall  enroll  new  qualified
 plaintiffs  in  the  order  that  an application for enrollment has been
 submitted in accordance with subdivision seven  of  section  twenty-nine
 hundred  ninety-nine-j  of  this  title.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER
 PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, FOR THE STATE  FISCAL  YEAR  BEGINNING  APRIL
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND ENDING MARCH THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOU-
 SAND TWENTY-FIVE, THE FUND SHALL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT NEW ENROLLMENTS.
  §  4.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 sections one and two of this act shall take effect on the ninetieth  day
 after it shall have become a law.
