  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Healthy Vision Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 2023, as Healthy
Vision Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Healthy Vision Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  the moment you wake up until you go to bed at night,
your eyes are working to deliver 80% of  the  information  you  take  in
every  day, about your loved ones, your job, and all the things you love
to see and do; it is important to keep your eyes healthy and safe; and
 
  WHEREAS, May of each year is Healthy Vision Month,  a  national  eye
health  observance  established  by  the National Eye Institute (NEI) in
2003; NEI is one of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of  the
United States Department of Health and Human Services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Healthy  Vision  Month  was  designed  to  raise
awareness of vision as a health issue for  all  Americans;  millions  of
citizens  have undetected vision problems, eye diseases, and conditions;
and
 
  WHEREAS, When it comes to your vision, you may not realize you could
see better with glasses or contacts, and many serious  eye  diseases  do
not  have  any  warning  signs;  however,  most  vision  problems  are
preventable; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each and every person should have a  comprehensive  dilated
eye  exam,  the first step in maintaining eye health and preserving your
sight; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, to getting an eye exam, these tips  will  help
keep  your eyes healthy and safe: know your family's eye health history;
protect your eyes, at work  and  play;  give  your  eyes  a  rest;  wear
sunglasses,  even  on  cloudy  days;  eat  eye-healthy  foods; stay at a
healthy weight; and get plenty of physical activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  issue  and  more must be done to improve vision health for all New
Yorkers and those affected by such vision health issues; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 2023, as Healthy
Vision Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
