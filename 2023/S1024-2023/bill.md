 Introduced  by  Sen.  COONEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  in  relation  to
  "economic  loss"  and  damages  for  health  care costs in actions for
  medical, dental or podiatric malpractice

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 1600 of the civil practice law and rules, as added
 by chapter 682 of the laws of 1986, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1600. Definitions. 1. As used in this article the term "non-economic
 loss" includes but is not limited to pain and suffering, mental anguish,
 loss of consortium or other damages for non-economic loss.
  2. AS USED IN THIS ARTICLE, THE TERM "ECONOMIC LOSS" INCLUDES  BUT  IS
 NOT  LIMITED  TO  THE COST OF MEDICAL CARE, DENTAL CARE, CUSTODIAL CARE,
 REHABILITATION SERVICES, LOSS OF EARNINGS, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES  FOR
 ECONOMIC LOSS.
  §  2.  Subdivision  1  of  section  1601 of the civil practice law and
 rules, as amended by chapter 635 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read
 as follows:
  1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a verdict or deci-
 sion in an action or claim for personal injury is determined in favor of
 a claimant in an action involving two or more tortfeasors jointly liable
 or in a claim against the state and the  liability  of  a  defendant  is
 found to be fifty percent or less of the total liability assigned to all
 persons  liable,  the  liability  of  such defendant to the claimant for
 non-economic loss AND ECONOMIC LOSS shall not  exceed  that  defendant's
 equitable  share  determined in accordance with the relative culpability
 of each person causing or contributing to the total liability for non-e-
 conomic loss AND ECONOMIC LOSS;  provided,  however  that  the  culpable
 conduct  of any person not a party to the action shall not be considered
 in determining any equitable share herein if the  claimant  proves  that

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 with due diligence he or she was unable to obtain jurisdiction over such
 person  in  said  action (or in a claim against the state, in a court of
 this state); and further provided  that  the  culpable  conduct  of  any
 person shall not be considered in determining any equitable share herein
 to  the  extent  that  action  against such person is barred because the
 claimant has not sustained a "grave injury" as defined in section eleven
 of the workers' compensation law.
  § 3. Section 3012-a of the civil practice law and rules, as amended by
 chapter 507 of the laws of 1987, is amended to read as follows:
  § 3012-a. [Certificate] AFFIDAVIT of  merit  in  medical,  dental  and
 podiatric  malpractice actions. (a) In any action for medical, dental or
 podiatric malpractice, the complaint shall be accompanied by [a  certif-
 icate, executed by the attorney for the plaintiff, declaring] AN AFFIDA-
 VIT  OF  MERIT EXECUTED BY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL WHO THE PLAINTIFF'S
 ATTORNEY OR, THE PLAINTIFF IF NOT REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY, REASONABLY
 BELIEVES IS KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE RELEVANT ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE PARTIC-
 ULAR ACTION TO BE AN EXPERT PHYSICIAN IN A MEDICAL  MALPRACTICE  ACTION,
 AN EXPERT DENTIST IN A DENTAL MALPRACTICE ACTION OR AN EXPERT PODIATRIST
 IN A PODIATRIC MALPRACTICE ACTION, STATING that[:
  (1)  the attorney has reviewed the facts of the case and has consulted
 with at least one physician in medical malpractice actions, at least one
 dentist in dental malpractice actions or  at  least  one  podiatrist  in
 podiatric  malpractice actions who is licensed to practice in this state
 or any other state and who the attorney  reasonably  believes  is  know-
 ledgeable  in the relevant issues involved in the particular action, and
 that the attorney has concluded on the basis of such review and  consul-
 tation  that  there  is  a reasonable basis for the commencement of such
 action; or
  (2) the attorney was unable to obtain  the  consultation  required  by
 paragraph  one  of this subdivision because a limitation of time, estab-
 lished by article two of this chapter, would bar the action and that the
 certificate required by paragraph one  of  this  subdivision  could  not
 reasonably  be  obtained  before  such time expired. If a certificate is
 executed pursuant to this subdivision, the certificate required by  this
 section  shall  be  filed  within  ninety  days  after  service  of  the
 complaint; or
  (3) the attorney was unable to obtain  the  consultation  required  by
 paragraph  one  of  this subdivision because the attorney had made three
 separate good faith attempts with three separate physicians, dentists or
 podiatrists, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph one of  this
 subdivision  to  obtain  such  consultation  and none of those contacted
 would agree to such a consultation] THE PHYSICIAN IN A MEDICAL  MALPRAC-
 TICE  ACTION,  OR  THE  DENTIST  IN  A DENTAL MALPRACTICE ACTION, OR THE
 PODIATRIST IN A PODIATRIC MALPRACTICE ACTION HAS REVIEWED THE  COMPLAINT
 IN  THE  MALPRACTICE  ACTION  AND  ALL  MEDICAL  RECORDS SUPPLIED BY THE
 PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY, OR PLAINTIFF IF NOT REPRESENTED  BY  AN  ATTORNEY,
 AND  STATES  EACH  OF THE FOLLOWING WITH INDIVIDUAL PARTICULARIZATION TO
 THE SPECIFICALLY NAMED DEFENDANT OR DEFENDANTS:
  (1) THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF PRACTICE OR CARE CONCERNING THE ALLEGA-
 TIONS CONTAINED IN THE COMPLAINT.
  (2) THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF PRACTICE OR CARE BREACHED.
  (3) THE ACTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR  OMITTED  IN  ORDER  TO
 HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF CARE.
  (4) THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BREACH OF THE STANDARD OF PRACTICE OR CARE
 WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE PLAINTIFF'S INJURY.
 S. 1024  3
 
  (b)  [Where  a  certificate  is  required  pursuant to this section, a
 single certificate shall be filed for each action, even if more than one
 defendant has been named in the  complaint  or  is  subsequently  named]
 WHERE  AN  AFFIDAVIT  OF  MERIT IS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, AN
 INDIVIDUAL  AFFIDAVIT  SHALL  BE FILED FOR EACH NAMED DEFENDANT WHO IS A
 PHYSICIAN, DENTIST OR PODIATRIST NAMED IN THE COMPLAINT.
  (c) Where the attorney intends to rely solely on the doctrine of  "res
 ipsa  loquitur", this section shall be inapplicable.  In such cases, the
 complaint shall be accompanied by [a certificate] AN AFFIDAVIT, executed
 by the attorney, declaring that the attorney is solely relying  on  such
 doctrine and, for that reason, is not filing [a certificate] THE AFFIDA-
 VIT OF MERIT required by this section.
  (d)  [If a request by the plaintiff for the records of the plaintiff's
 medical or dental treatment by the defendants has  been  made  and  such
 records  have  not been produced, the plaintiff shall not be required to
 serve the certificate required by this section until ninety  days  after
 such  records  have been produced] THE PLAINTIFF MAY, IN LIEU OF SERVING
 THE AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION, PROVIDE  THE  DEFENDANT
 OR DEFENDANTS WITH THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH ONE OF SUBDIVI-
 SION  (D)  OF  SECTION THIRTY-ONE HUNDRED ONE OF THIS CHAPTER WITHIN THE
 PERIOD OF TIME PRESCRIBED BY THIS SECTION, PROVIDED THAT THE  DISCLOSURE
 BE  EXECUTED  BY  THE  PHYSICIAN IN A MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTION, OR THE
 DENTIST IN A DENTAL MALPRACTICE ACTION, OR THE PODIATRIST IN A PODIATRIC
 MALPRACTICE ACTION WHO HAS REVIEWED THE  COMPLAINT  IN  THE  MALPRACTICE
 ACTION AND ALL MEDICAL RECORDS SUPPLIED BY THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY.
  (e)  [For  purposes  of this section, and subject to the provisions of
 section thirty-one hundred one of this chapter, an attorney who  submits
 a  certificate as required by paragraph one or two of subdivision (a) of
 this section and the physician, dentist  or  podiatrist  with  whom  the
 attorney consulted shall not be required to disclose the identity of the
 physician,  dentist  or  podiatrist  consulted  and the contents of such
 consultation; provided, however, that when the attorney  makes  a  claim
 under  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (a) of this section that he was
 unable to obtain the required consultation with the  physician,  dentist
 or podiatrist, the court may, upon the request of a defendant made prior
 to compliance by the plaintiff with the provisions of section thirty-one
 hundred  of  this  chapter, require the attorney to divulge to the court
 the names of physicians, dentists or podiatrists refusing such consulta-
 tion] THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY OR, THE PLAINTIFF IF NOT  REPRESENTED  BY
 AN  ATTORNEY,  MAY  WITH  GOOD  CAUSE SHOWN, FILE A MOTION TO EXTEND THE
 PERIOD OF TIME TO FILE THE REQUIRED AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT. THE MOTION SHALL
 BE FILED TOGETHER WITH THE COMPLAINT. THE  COURT  MAY  GRANT  REASONABLE
 TIME  TO  FILE THE AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT, NOT TO EXCEED NINETY DAYS, EXCEPT
 THE TIME MAY BE EXTENDED BEYOND NINETY DAYS IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT
 A DEFENDANT OR NON-PARTY HAS FAILED TO COOPERATE WITH ACCESS TO  MEDICAL
 OR  DENTAL  RECORDS  NECESSARY  FOR THE AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT OR THAT OTHER
 CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT EXTENSION OF TIME.
  (f) [The provisions of this section  shall  not  be  applicable  to  a
 plaintiff who is not represented by an attorney.
  (g)  The plaintiff may, in lieu of serving the certificate required by
 this section, provide the defendant or defendants with  the  information
 required  by  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  (d) of section thirty-one
 hundred one of this chapter within the period of time prescribed by this
 section] ANY COMPLAINT ALLEGING MEDICAL, DENTAL, OR  PODIATRIC  MALPRAC-
 TICE  THAT  IS  NOT  ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT AS REQUIRED BY
 THIS SECTION SHALL BE DEEMED DEFECTIVE AS A  MATTER  OF  LAW  AND,  UPON
 S. 1024  4

 MOTION  BY  THE DEFENDANT, BE DISMISSED ON THE MERITS BY THE COURT. SUCH
 DISMISSAL SHALL BE WITH PREJUDICE.
  §  4.  Paragraphs  3  and  4 of subdivision (a) of section 3101 of the
 civil practice law and rules, as amended by chapter 98 of  the  laws  of
 1993, are amended and a new paragraph 5 is added to read as follows:
  (3)  a person about to depart from the state, or without the state, or
 residing at a greater distance from the place of trial than one  hundred
 miles,  or  so  sick or infirm as to afford reasonable grounds of belief
 that he or she will not be able to attend the trial, or a person author-
 ized to practice  medicine,  dentistry  or  podiatry  who  has  provided
 medical,  dental  or  podiatric care or diagnosis to the party demanding
 disclosure, or who has been retained by such party as an expert witness;
 [and]
  (4) any other person, upon notice stating the circumstances or reasons
 such disclosure is sought or required[.]; AND
  (5) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF PARAGRAPH ONE
 OF SUBDIVISION (D) OF THIS SECTION TO THE CONTRARY,  IN  AN  ACTION  FOR
 MEDICAL,  DENTAL  OR  PODIATRIC  MALPRACTICE, EACH PARTY SHALL SERVE THE
 DISCLOSURE DESCRIBED IN SUCH SUBPARAGRAPH WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS  PRECEDING
 THE  FILING  REQUIRED  BY  RULE THIRTY-FOUR HUNDRED TWO OF THIS CHAPTER.
 FURTHER, AT ANY TIME AFTER JOINDER OF ISSUE, ANY PARTY MAY,  BY  WRITTEN
 NOTICE  MADE  TO  AND  SERVED  UPON ALL OTHER PARTIES AND FILED WITH THE
 COURT; CONDUCT AN EXAMINATION UPON ORAL DEPOSITION OF ANY PERSON WHO HAS
 BEEN DISCLOSED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS BY ANY OTHER PARTY. EACH PARTY SHALL
 BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE HIS OR HER EXPERT WITNESS  FOR  EXAMINATION  UPON
 ORAL  DEPOSITION  UPON  RECEIPT  OF  A NOTICE TO TAKE ORAL DEPOSITION IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH RULE THIRTY-ONE  HUNDRED  SEVEN  OF  THIS  ARTICLE  AND,
 UNLESS  OTHERWISE  ORDERED  BY THE COURT, ALL EXPERT WITNESS DEPOSITIONS
 SHALL BE TAKEN BEFORE THE FILING REQUIRED BY  RULE  THIRTY-FOUR  HUNDRED
 TWO OF THIS CHAPTER. IF ANY PARTY, HAVING RECEIVED SUCH NOTICE, FAILS TO
 MAKE  THAT  PARTY'S  EXPERT  WITNESS AVAILABLE FOR ORAL DEPOSITION, THAT
 PARTY SHALL BE PRECLUDED FROM OFFERING EXPERT TESTIMONY AT THE TRIAL  OF
 THE  ACTION.  FOR PURPOSES OF RULE THIRTY-ONE HUNDRED TEN AND RULE THIR-
 TY-ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE, AN EXPERT WITNESS, AS PROVIDED
 IN THIS SECTION, SHALL BE CONSIDERED A PARTY.  EACH PARTY  SEEKING  THE
 DEPOSITION  OF  AN  EXPERT WITNESS SHALL PAY THE EXPERT A REASONABLE FEE
 FOR THE TIME SPENT AT THE DEPOSITION.
  § 5. Paragraph 1 of subdivision (d) of section 3101 of the civil prac-
 tice law and rules, as amended by chapter  184  of  the  laws  of  1988,
 subparagraph  (ii)  as  amended  by  chapter 165 of the laws of 1991, is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. Experts. (i) Upon request, each party shall  identify  each  person
 whom  the  party expects to call as an expert witness at trial and shall
 disclose in reasonable detail the subject matter on which each expert is
 expected to testify, the substance of the facts and  opinions  on  which
 each  expert  is  expected to testify, the qualifications of each expert
 witness and a summary of the grounds for each expert's opinion. However,
 where a party for good cause shown retains  an  expert  an  insufficient
 period  of  time  before  the  commencement of trial to give appropriate
 notice thereof, the party shall not thereupon be precluded  from  intro-
 ducing  the expert's testimony at the trial solely on grounds of noncom-
 pliance with this paragraph. In that instance, upon motion of any party,
 made before or at trial, or on its own initiative, the  court  may  make
 whatever  order may be just. [In an action for medical, dental or podia-
 tric malpractice, a party, in responding to  a  request,  may  omit  the
 names  of  medical, dental or podiatric experts but shall be required to
 S. 1024  5

 disclose  all  other  information  concerning  such  experts  otherwise
 required by this paragraph.
  (ii)  In  an  action for medical, dental or podiatric malpractice, any
 party may, by written offer made to and served upon  all  other  parties
 and  filed  with  the  court, offer to disclose the name of, and to make
 available for examination upon oral deposition,  any  person  the  party
 making  the  offer expects to call as an expert witness at trial. Within
 twenty days of service of the offer, a party shall accept or reject  the
 offer  by  serving  a  written  reply upon all parties and filing a copy
 thereof with the court. Failure to serve a reply within twenty  days  of
 service  of  the  offer shall be deemed a rejection of the offer. If all
 parties accept the offer, each party shall be required to produce his or
 her expert witness for examination upon oral deposition upon receipt  of
 a  notice  to  take  oral  deposition in accordance with rule thirty-one
 hundred seven of this chapter. If any party, having made or accepted the
 offer, fails to make that party's expert available for oral  deposition,
 that  party  shall  be  precluded  from offering expert testimony at the
 trial of the action.
  (iii)] (II) Further disclosure concerning the  expected  testimony  of
 any  expert,  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH FIVE OF SUBDIVI-
 SION (A) OF THIS SECTION, may be obtained only by  court  order  upon  a
 showing of special circumstances and subject to restrictions as to scope
 and provisions concerning fees and expenses as the court may deem appro-
 priate. However, a party, without court order, may take the testimony of
 a  person  authorized to practice medicine, dentistry or podiatry who is
 the party's treating or retained expert, as described in paragraph three
 of subdivision (a) of this section, in which event any other party shall
 be entitled to the full  disclosure  authorized  by  this  article  with
 respect to that expert without court order.
  §  6.  The  civil  practice  law  and rules is amended by adding a new
 section 4546-a to read as follows:
  § 4546-A. DAMAGES FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS IN ACTIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL
 OR PODIATRIC MALPRACTICE. 1. DEFINITIONS. "HEALTH CARE COSTS" SHALL MEAN
 THE COSTS FOR MEDICAL CARE, DENTAL CARE, CUSTODIAL  CARE,  OR  REHABILI-
 TATION SERVICES.
  2.  IN  ANY  ACTION FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL, OR PODIATRIC MALPRACTICE, THE
 AMOUNT OF HEALTH CARE COSTS SHALL BE CALCULATED:  (A)  WITH  RESPECT  TO
 SERVICES  PROVIDED  IN  PRIVATE  PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ON THE BASIS OF ONE
 HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY  RATES,  AS  DEFINED  BY  THE
 COMMISSIONER  OF  HEALTH IN REGULATION; OR (B) WITH RESPECT TO ALL OTHER
 SERVICES, ON THE BASIS OF MEDICAID RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT OR,  WHERE  NO
 SUCH  RATES  ARE  AVAILABLE, AS DEFINED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH IN
 REGULATION.
  § 7. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall  have  become  a  law  and  shall  apply  to  all  actions  and
 proceedings  commenced  on  or  after such date; provided, however, that
 sections four and five of this act shall take effect  on  the  ninetieth
 day after it shall have become a law.
