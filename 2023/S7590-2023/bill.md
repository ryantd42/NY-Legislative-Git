 AN ACT to amend the public health law and  the  state  finance  law,  in
  relation  to  enacting  the "New York health act" and establishing New
  York Health
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York health act".
  § 2. Legislative  findings  and  intent.  1.  The  state  constitution
 states:  "The  protection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants
 of the state are matters of public concern and provision therefor  shall
 be made by the state and by such of its subdivisions and in such manner,
 and by such means as the legislature shall from time to time determine."
 (Article  XVII,  §3.)  The legislature finds and declares that all resi-
 dents of the state have the right to health care.  While  the  federal
 Affordable  Care Act brought many improvements in health care and health
 coverage, it still leaves many New  Yorkers  without  coverage  or  with
 inadequate coverage.  Millions of New Yorkers do not get the health care
 they  need  or face financial obstacles and hardships to get it. That is
 not acceptable.  There is no plan that has been put forward  other  than
 the  New  York  health  act that will enable New York state to meet that
 need.  New Yorkers - as individuals, employers,  and  taxpayers  -  have
 experienced  a  rise  in  the cost of health care and coverage in recent
 years, including rising premiums, deductibles  and  co-pays,  restricted
 provider  networks and high out-of-network charges.  Many New Yorkers go

 without health care because they cannot afford it or suffer  significant
 financial  hardship  to  get  it.  Businesses  have  also  experienced
 increases in the costs of health care benefits for their employees,  and
 many  employers  are  shifting a larger share of the cost of coverage to
 their employees or dropping  coverage  entirely.  Including  long-term
 services  and supports (LTSS) in New York Health is a major step forward
 for older adults, people with disabilities, and  their  families.  Older
 adults  and  people  with disabilities often cannot receive the services
 necessary to stay in the community or other LTSS. Even when older adults
 and people with disabilities receive LTSS, especially  services  in  the
 community, it is often at great cost and creates unreasonable demands on
 unpaid  family  caregivers,  depleting their own or family resources, or
 impoverishing themselves to qualify for public coverage.  Health  care
 providers  are  also  affected by inadequate health coverage in New York
 state. A large portion of hospitals, health centers and other  providers
 now  experience  substantial losses due to the provision of care that is
 uncompensated.  Medicaid and Medicare often do not pay  rates  that  are
 reasonably  related  to  the  cost  of efficiently providing health care
 services and sufficient to assure an adequate and accessible  supply  of
 health  care  services,  as  guaranteed  under  the New York Health Act.
 Individuals often find that they are deprived  of  affordable  care  and
 choice because of decisions by health plans guided by the plan's econom-
 ic  interests rather than the individual's health care needs. To address
 the fiscal crisis facing the health care system and  the  state  and  to
 assure  New  Yorkers can exercise their right to health care, affordable
 and comprehensive health coverage must  be  provided.  Pursuant  to  the
 state constitution's charge to the legislature to provide for the health
 of  New  Yorkers,  this legislation is an enactment of state concern for
 the purpose of establishing a comprehensive universal guaranteed  health
 care  coverage  program  and  a  health care cost control system for the
 benefit of all residents of the state of New York.
  2. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature  to  create  the  New  York
 Health program to provide a universal single payer health plan for every
 resident of the state, funded by broad-based revenue based on ability to
 pay.  The  legislature  intends  that federal waivers and approvals be
 sought where they will improve the administration of the New York Health
 program, but the legislature intends that  the  program  be  implemented
 even  in the absence of such waivers or approvals.  The state shall work
 to obtain waivers and other approvals relating to Medicaid, Child Health
 Plus, Medicare, the Basic Health Plan (Essential Plan),  the  Affordable
 Care Act, and any other appropriate federal programs, under which feder-
 al  funds  and  other subsidies that would otherwise be paid to New York
 State, New Yorkers, and health care providers for health  coverage  that
 will  be  equaled  or  exceeded  by  New York Health will be paid by the
 federal government to New York State  and  deposited  in  the  New  York
 Health  trust  fund, or paid to health care providers and individuals in
 combination with New York Health trust  fund  payments,  and  for  other
 program  modifications (including elimination of cost sharing and insur-
 ance premiums).  Under such waivers and approvals, health coverage under
 those programs will, to the maximum extent  possible,  be  replaced  and
 merged  into  New York Health, which will operate as a true single-payer
 program.
  (b) If any necessary waiver or approval is  not  obtained,  the  state
 shall  use state plan amendments and seek waivers and approvals to maxi-
 mize, and make as seamless as possible, the use of  federally-subsidized
 health  programs  and federal health programs in New York Health.  Thus,
 S. 7590  3

 even where other programs such as Medicaid or Medicare may contribute to
 paying for care, it is the goal of this legislation  that  the  coverage
 will  be  delivered  by  New  York  Health and, as much as possible, the
 multiple  sources  of  funding will be pooled with other New York Health
 funds and not be apparent to New York Health  members  or  participating
 providers.
  (c)  This  program  will  promote  movement  away from fee-for-service
 payment, which tends to reward quantity and requires excessive  adminis-
 trative  expense,  and  towards alternate payment methodologies, such as
 global or capitated payments to providers or health care  organizations,
 that  promote  quality, efficiency, investment in primary and preventive
 care, and innovation and integration in the organizing of health care.
  (d) The program shall promote the use of clinical data to improve  the
 quality  of health care and public health, consistent with protection of
 patient confidentiality. The program shall maximize patient autonomy  in
 choice  of  health care providers and health care decision making.  Care
 coordination within the program shall ensure management and coordination
 among a patient's health care services, consistent with patient autonomy
 and person-centered service planning, rather than acting as a gatekeeper
 to needed services.
  (e) The program shall operate with care, skill,  prudence,  diligence,
 and professionalism, and for the best interests primarily of the members
 and health care providers.
  3.  This  act  does  not create or relate to any employment benefit or
 employment benefit plan, nor does it require,  prohibit,  or  limit  the
 providing of any employment benefit or employment benefit plan.
  4. In order to promote improved quality of, and access to, health care
 services and promote improved clinical outcomes, it is the policy of the
 state  to  encourage cooperative, collaborative and integrative arrange-
 ments among health care providers who might  otherwise  be  competitors,
 under  the  active  supervision of the commissioner of health. It is the
 intent of the state to supplant competition with such  arrangements  and
 regulation  only  to  the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of
 this act, and to provide state  action  immunity  under  the  state  and
 federal  antitrust  laws  to  health  care  providers, particularly with
 respect to their relations with the single-payer New  York  Health  plan
 created by this act.
  5.  There  have  been numerous professional economic analyses of state
 and national single-payer  health  proposals,  including  the  New  York
 Health Act, by noted consulting firms and academic economists. They have
 almost  all  come  to  similar conclusions of net savings in the cost of
 health coverage and health care. These savings are driven by (a)  elimi-
 nating  the  administrative  bureaucracy costs, marketing, and profit of
 multiple health plans and replacing that  with  the  dramatically  lower
 costs  of  running a single-payer system; (b) substantially reducing the
 administrative costs borne by health care providers dealing  with  those
 health  plans; and (c) using the negotiating power of 20 million consum-
 ers to achieve lower drug prices. These savings will  more  than  offset
 costs primarily from (a) relieving patients of deductibles, co-pays, and
 out-of-network  charges;  (b)  covering  the  uninsured;  (c) increasing
 provider payment rates  above  Medicare  and  Medicaid  rates;  and  (d)
 replacing uncompensated home health care with paid care. Unlike premiums
 and out-of-pocket spending, the New York Health Act tax will be progres-
 sively  graduated  based  on  ability to pay.  The vast majority of New
 Yorkers today spend dramatically more in premiums, deductibles and other
 out-of-pocket costs than they will in New York Health Act taxes.  They
 S. 7590  4
 
 will  have  broader  coverage  (including long-term care), no restricted
 provider networks or  out-of-network  charges,  and  no  deductibles  or
 co-pays.

 health law are renumbered article 80 and sections 8000, 8001,  8002  and

 unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
  (i)  "New  York  Health  program"  and the "program" mean the New York
 Health program, as created by article 51 of the public  health  law  and
 all provisions of that article.
  (ii)  "Revenue proposal" means the revenue plan and legislative bills,
 as proposed and enacted under  this  section,  to  provide  the  revenue
 necessary to finance the New York Health program.
  (iii)  "Tax"  means  the  payroll tax or non-payroll tax to be enacted
 under the revenue proposal. "Payroll  tax"  means  the  tax  on  payroll
 income  and  self-employed  income  subject  to the Medicare Part A tax,
 provided for in subdivision two of this section. "Non-payroll tax" means
 the tax on taxable income (such  as  interest,  dividends,  and  capital
 gains)  not  subject to the payroll tax, provided for in subdivision two
 of this section.
 S. 7590  23
 
  (b) The governor shall submit to the legislature a  revenue  proposal.
 The  revenue  proposal  shall be submitted to the legislature as part of
 the executive budget under article VII of the  state  constitution,  for
 the  fiscal  year  commencing  on the first day of April in the calendar
 year  after  this  act  shall  become  a  law. In developing the revenue
 proposal, the governor shall consult with appropriate officials  of  the
 executive  branch; the temporary president of the senate; the speaker of
 the assembly; the chairs of the fiscal  and  health  committees  of  the
 senate  and  assembly; and representatives of business, labor, consumers
 and local government.
  2. (a) Basic structure. The basic structure of  the  revenue  proposal
 shall  be as follows: Revenue for the program shall come from two taxes.
 First, there shall be a progressively graduated tax on all  payroll  and
 self-employed  income,  paid  by  employers, employees and self-employed
 individuals.  Second, there shall be a progressively  graduated  tax  on
 taxable  income  (such  as  interest,  dividends, and capital gains) not
 subject to the payroll tax.  Income in the  bracket  below  twenty-five
 thousand  dollars per year shall be exempt from the taxes; provided that
 for individuals enrolled in Medicare as defined in the  program,  income
 in  the  bracket  below  fifty thousand dollars per year shall be exempt
 from the taxes.  Higher brackets of income subject to the taxes shall be
 assessed at a higher marginal rate than lower brackets.  The taxes shall
 be set at levels anticipated to produce sufficient  revenue  to  finance
 the  program, to be scaled up as enrollment grows, taking into consider-
 ation anticipated federal revenue available for the  program.  Provision
 shall  be  made  for  state residents who are employed out-of-state, and
 non-residents who are employed in the state  (including  those  employed
 less than full-time).
  (b) Payroll tax. (i) The income to be subject to the payroll tax shall
 be  all income subject to the Medicare Part A tax. The payroll tax shall
 be set at a percentage of that  income,  which  shall  be  progressively
 graduated, so the percentage is higher on higher brackets of income. For
 employed  individuals,  the  employer  shall  pay  eighty percent of the
 payroll tax and the employee shall pay twenty percent of the tax, except
 that an employer may agree to pay all or part of the  employee's  share.
 A self-employed individual shall pay the full tax.
  (ii)  Each  public  employer,  as  defined in section 201 of the civil
 service law, shall pay a percentage of the payroll tax for each  of  its
 employees that is equal to at least the greater of (A) the percentage of
 the  cost  of the employee's health benefit that is paid by the employer
 as of January 1 immediately preceding the date  on  which  this  section
 becomes  a  law,  or  (B)  a  greater  percentage provided by collective
 bargaining, or (C) eighty percent.
  (c) Non-payroll income tax. There shall be a tax  on  income  that  is
 subject  to  the personal income tax under article 22 of the tax law and
 is not subject to the payroll tax. It shall be set at  a  percentage  of
 that  income,  which shall be progressively graduated, so the percentage
 is higher on higher brackets of income.
  (d) Phased-in rates. Early in the program, when enrollment is growing,
 the amount of the taxes shall be at an appropriate level, and  shall  be
 changed as anticipated enrollment grows, to cover the actual cost of the
 program.  The revenue proposal shall include a mechanism for determining
 the rates of the taxes.
  (e) Cross-border employees. (i) State residents employed out-of-state.
 If an individual is employed out-of-state by an employer that is subject
 to New York state law, the employer and employee shall  be  required  to
 S. 7590  24
 
 pay the payroll tax as to that employee as if the employment were in the
 state.  If an individual is employed out-of-state by an employer that is
 not subject to New York state law, either (A) the employer and  employee
 shall  voluntarily comply with the tax or (B) the employee shall pay the
 tax as if he or she were self-employed.
  (ii) Out-of-state residents employed in the state.  The  payroll  tax
 shall  apply  to  any  out-of-state resident who is employed or self-em-
 ployed in the state.  Such individual and individual's employer shall be
 able to take a credit against the payroll taxes each would otherwise pay
 as to that individual for amounts  they  spend  respectively  on  health
 benefits (A) for the individual, if the individual is not eligible to be
 a  member  of  the  program,  and (B) for any member of the individual's
 immediate family.  For the employer,  the  credit  shall  be  available
 regardless  of the form of the health benefit (e.g., health insurance, a
 self-insured plan, direct services, or reimbursement for  services),  to
 make  sure that the revenue proposal does not relate to employment bene-
 fits in violation of any federal law. For non-employment-based  spending
 by  the  individual,  the  credit  shall be available for and limited to
 spending for health coverage (not out-of-pocket  health  spending).  The
 credit  shall  be available without regard to how little is spent or how
 sparse the benefit. The credit may only be  taken  against  the  payroll
 tax.  Any  excess  amount may not be applied to other tax liability. The
 credit shall be distributed between the employer  and  employee  in  the
 same  proportion  as  the  spending  by  each for the benefit and may be
 applied to their respective portion of the tax. If any provision of this
 subparagraph or any application of it shall be ruled to violate  federal
 law,  the  provision or the application of it shall be null and void and
 the ruling shall not affect any other provision or application  of  this
 section or the act that enacted it.
  3.  (a)  The  revenue  proposal  shall  include a plan and legislative
 provisions  for  ending  the  requirement  for  local  social  services
 districts  to  pay  part  of  the  cost  of Medicaid and replacing those
 payments with revenue from the taxes under the revenue proposal.
  (b) The taxes under this section shall not supplant  the  spending  of
 other  state  revenue to pay for the Medicaid program as it exists as of
 the enactment of the revenue proposal as  amended,  unless  the  revenue
 proposal as amended provides otherwise.
  4.  To  the extent that the revenue proposal differs from the terms of
 subdivision two or paragraph (b) of subdivision three of  this  section,
 the  revenue  proposal  shall  state how it differs from those terms and
 reasons for and the effects of the differences.
  5. All revenue from the taxes shall  be  deposited  in  the  New  York
 Health trust fund account under section 89-k of the state finance law.
  §  5.  Article  49 of the public health law is amended by adding a new
 title 3 to read as follows:
