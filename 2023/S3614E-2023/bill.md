  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and the Education Law to increase the salary ranges used in
 determining the employee contribution percentages  for  Tier  6  members
 S. 3614--C  11
 
 thereby  decreasing  future required employee contributions. The current
 salary ranges would each increase by $5,000 on April 1, 2025.  Beginning
 on  April 1, 2026, salary ranges would then be increased annually by the
 increase  in  the  consumer price index in the one-year period ending on
 December thirty-first of the year prior, not to exceed 3%.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $28.7
 million or 0.15% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture. This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost  of
 Tier  6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed change
 to the Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new  entrant  rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.67% of pay, an increase of 0.36% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be  found  in  the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June 30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuarial  assump-
 tions  and  methods  are  provided  in  the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-7  dated  February  2,
 2024  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2024
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
