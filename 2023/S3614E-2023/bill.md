  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and the Education Law to increase the salary ranges used in
 S. 3614--E  11
 
 determining the employee contribution percentages  for  Tier  6  members
 thereby  decreasing  future required employee contributions. The current
 salary ranges would each increase by $5,000 on April 1, 2025.  Beginning
 on  April 1, 2026, salary ranges would then be increased annually by the
 increase in the consumer price index in the one-year  period  ending  on
 December thirty-first of the year prior, not to exceed 3%.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $28.7
 million or 0.15% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.67% of pay, an increase of 0.36% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be found in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year  ended  June  30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and  can  also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuarial assump-
 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The  source  of  this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-7 dated February 2,
 2024 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the
 American  Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would increase the  wage  ranges  to  which  Tier  6  member
 contribution  rates  are  applied  effective  April  1,  2025 by $5,000.
 Beginning on April 1, 2026, the wage ranges would increase each year  by
 the annual inflation rate rounded up to the next tenth of a percent, not
 to exceed three percent.
  The current contribution rates and wage ranges for Tier 6 members are:
  * three (3) percent for wages of $45,000 or less,
  * three and one-half (3.5)  percent for wages greater than $45,000 but
 not more than $55,000,
  * four and one-half (4.5) percent for wages greater than  $55,000  but
 not more than $75,000,
  * five  and  three-quarters  (5.75)  percent  for  wages  greater than
 $75,000 but not more than $100,000, or
  * six (6) percent for wages greater than $100,000.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS), if this legislation is enacted during the
 2024 Legislative Session, there would be  an  increase  in  the  present
 value  of  future  costs  of  approximately  $660 million which would be
 shared by the State of New York and all local participating employers in
 the NYSLERS. These costs will be funded by  increasing  Tier  6  billing
 rates by an average 0.5% of salary.
  The  increased  billing  rates  will result in a recurring, increasing
 annual contribution beginning in the fiscal year ending March  31,  2026
 S. 3614--E  12
 
 of  approximately $38 million to the State of New York and approximately
 $54 million to local participating employers in the NYSLERS. THESE ANNU-
 AL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS and will
 vary  by  employer  based  upon the plan coverage and salary reported in
 Tier 6.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this legislation is enacted during
 the  2024 Legislative Session, there would be an increase in the present
 value of future costs of approximately $11 million which would be shared
 by the State of New York and all local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS.  These costs will be funded by increasing Tier 6 billing rates
 by an average 0.1% of salary.
  The increased billing rates will result  in  a  recurring,  increasing
 annual  contribution  beginning in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026
 of approximately $400,000 to the State of  New  York  and  approximately
 $1.4  million  to  local  participating employers in the NYSLPFRS. THESE
 ANNUAL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS  and
 will  vary  by employer based upon the plan coverage and salary reported
 in Tier 6.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY:  This proposed legislation, as it relates  to  the  New  York
 City  Retirement  Systems  and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would introduce an
 annual increase based on inflation for the salary bands used  to  deter-
 mine contribution rates for Tier 6 members of NYCERS, TRS, and BERS.

  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS  TRS  BERS
 Active Members
 - Number Count:  85,203  60,663  12,932

 S. 3614--E  14

 - Average Salary:  78900  80,000  56,200
 
  IMPACT  ON MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS:  Currently, Tier 6 members of NYCERS,
 TRS, and BERS are generally required to make Basic Member  Contributions
 (BMC)  ranging  from 3% to 6% of annual wages, determined by wages for a
 prior defined period.
  Under the proposed legislation, the salary bands used to determine BMC
 would be increased by specified amounts as shown in the table  below  on
 April 1, 2025.
 
 Contribution  Current Salary Band  New Salary Band
 Rate
 3.00%  $45,000 or less  $50,000 or less
 3.50%  $45,001 up to $55,000  $50,001 up to $60,000
 4.50%  $55,001 up to $75,000  $60,001 up to $80,000
 5.75%  $75,001 up to $100,000  $80,001 up to $105,000
 6.00%  Greater than $100,000  Greater than $105,000

  Beginning  April  1, 2026, and every year thereafter, the salary bands
 will increase by the prior calendar year's increase  in  consumer  price
 index  (CPI),  rounded to the next higher one-tenth of a percent, not to
 exceed 3% in any year. The result of an increase in Tier 6 salary  bands
 would be an overall decrease in employee contribution rates.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  * Future salary bands were assumed to increase 2.5% annually, consist-
 ent with the long-term CPI inflation rate assumption of 2.5%.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
