  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and the Education Law to increase the salary ranges used in
 determining the employee contribution percentages  for  Tier  6  members
 S. 3614--D  11
 
 thereby  decreasing  future required employee contributions. The current
 salary ranges would each increase by $5,000 on April 1, 2025.  Beginning
 on  April 1, 2026, salary ranges would then be increased annually by the
 increase  in  the  consumer price index in the one-year period ending on
 December thirty-first of the year prior, not to exceed 3%.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $28.7
 million or 0.15% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture. This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost  of
 Tier  6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed change
 to the Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new  entrant  rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.67% of pay, an increase of 0.36% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be  found  in  the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June 30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuarial  assump-
 tions  and  methods  are  provided  in  the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-7  dated  February  2,
 2024  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2024
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  increase  the  wage  ranges  to which Tier 6 member
 contribution rates are  applied  effective  April  1,  2025  by  $5,000.
 Beginning  on April 1, 2026, the wage ranges would increase each year by
 the annual inflation rate rounded up to the next tenth of a percent, not
 to exceed three percent.
  The current contribution rates and wage ranges for Tier 6 members are:
  * three (3) percent for wages of $45,000 or less,
  * three and one-half (3.5) percent for wages greater than $45,000  but
 not more than $55,000,
  *  four  and one-half (4.5) percent for wages greater than $55,000 but
 not more than $75,000,
  * five and  three-quarters  (5.75)  percent  for  wages  greater  than
 $75,000 but not more than $100,000, or
  * six (6) percent for wages greater than $100,000.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), if this legislation is enacted  during  the
 2024  Legislative  Session,  there  would  be an increase in the present
 value of future costs of  approximately  $660  million  which  would  be
 shared by the State of New York and all local participating employers in
 the  NYSLERS.  These  costs  will be funded by increasing Tier 6 billing
 rates by an average 0.5% of salary.
  The increased billing rates will result  in  a  recurring,  increasing
 annual  contribution  beginning in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026
 of approximately $38 million to the State of New York and  approximately
 S. 3614--D  12
 
 $54 million to local participating employers in the NYSLERS. THESE ANNU-
 AL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS and will
 vary  by  employer  based  upon the plan coverage and salary reported in
 Tier 6.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this legislation is enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, there would be an increase in the  present
 value of future costs of approximately $11 million which would be shared
 by  the  State  of New York and all local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. These costs will be funded by increasing Tier 6 billing  rates
 by an average 0.1% of salary.
  The  increased  billing  rates  will result in a recurring, increasing
 annual contribution beginning in the fiscal year ending March  31,  2026
 of  approximately  $400,000  to  the State of New York and approximately
 $1.4 million to local participating employers  in  the  NYSLPFRS.  THESE
 ANNUAL  COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS and
 will vary by employer based upon the plan coverage and  salary  reported
 in Tier 6.
