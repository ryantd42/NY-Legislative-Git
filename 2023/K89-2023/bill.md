  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2023, as Marfan Syndrome Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in recognizing days
of awareness for significant medical conditions with hopes of increasing
education as well as finding treatments and cures; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February 2023, as Marfan Syndrome
Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Marfan  syndrome  is  a  potentially  life-threatening
connective  tissue  condition  that affects the heart and blood vessels,
eyes, bones and joints, lungs, and other parts of  the  body;  the  most
dangerous part of the condition is the impact on the aorta, which is the
large artery that takes blood away from the heart; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  affected people, the aorta is prone to enlarge and can
tear or rupture, causing sudden early death, making early diagnosis  and
treatment critical; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  200,000  people  in  the  U.S. have Marfan and
related conditions, but  experts  estimate  that  about  half  of  these
individuals are not yet diagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Marfan  Foundation's  mission  is  to  save lives and
improve the quality of life for people living with Marfan  syndrome  and
related conditions by pursuing the most innovative research and ensuring
that the cause receives proper funding; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While keeping the medical community up-to-date to increase
early diagnosis and ensure life-saving treatment, The Marfan  Foundation
also  creates  an  informed  public  and  educated patient community; in
addition,  the  Foundation  provides  relentless  support  to  families,
caregivers, and healthcare providers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  the  financial,  physical,  and
psychological impact that Marfan syndrome has on those affected,  it  is
incumbent  of  the  citizens  of  the  State  of New York to support the
courageous individuals living and coping  with  the  condition,  and  to
advocate for life-saving treatments and research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
tireless advocates and healthcare providers who spend so much  of  their
time  and  resources battling this painful and destructive syndrome that
affects so many; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2023, as Marfan
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
