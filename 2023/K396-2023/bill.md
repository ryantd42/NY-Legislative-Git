  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May  3,  2023,  as  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of health  issues
that affect the lives of children of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 3, 2023, as Juvenile
Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, JIA Awareness Day was established  to  raise  awareness  of
this  devastating  childhood  disorder  and promote wellness among those
children affected; and
 
  WHEREAS, JIA is a disease that affects one in 1,000  young  children
in the United States and impacts their lives negatively; and
 
  WHEREAS,  If people in our community are educated about JIA they may
recognize the  symptoms  earlier  which  can  help  lead  to  a  quicker
diagnosis and initiation of treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  less than 350 pediatric rheumatologists in the
United States which means that patients may not have access to the  type
of doctor they need to treat JIA; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognizing  that  there  are  so  few  pediatric
rheumatologists, the  state  should  encourage  future  doctors  to  get
training  and  specialize  in this field of medicine to be able to treat
more patients with JIA; and
 
  WHEREAS, JIA medications can cost thousands of dollars  a  year  and
may not be covered by insurance, therefore, it is not affordable for all
families; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important for people to have access to medication and
physical therapy to reduce pain and swelling in order to properly manage
JIA; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  child of New York State with JIA deserves access to
high-quality treatment by a pediatric rheumatologist that is covered  by
insurance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is important that there be greater public awareness of
JIA and more must be done to improve joint health for  all  children  in
New  York,  including patient access to early detection and intervention
by  healthcare  professionals  in  the  process  of  identification  and
treatment of JIA; and now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 3, 2023,  as  Juvenile
 
Idiopathic  Arthritis  Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  the  New  York  State Department of Health; and to members of the
affected community.
