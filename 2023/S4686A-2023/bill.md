  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 State Phoenix Act".
  §  2.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares all of
 the following:
  1. More than one in three women and one in  four  men  in  the  United
 States have experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by an inti-
 mate partner in their lifetime.
  2.  One in five female high school students report being physically or
 sexually assaulted by a dating partner.
  3. Many perpetrators of domestic violence were themselves abused.
  4. Better education and resources can help prevent  domestic  violence
 from occurring.
  5.  When  domestic  violence occurs, the statute of limitations varies
 depending on the crime committed.
  6. Victims may not report a crime for myriad reasons, including  their
 age  at the time of abuse, ongoing trauma, threats from the perpetrator,
 or lack of evidence.
  7. Without resources or any intervention, many perpetrators of  domes-
 tic violence will abuse multiple partners.
  8.  It is the intent of the legislature to allow for victims of domes-
 tic violence to come forward by extending the statute of limitations  in
 order to ensure those victims see justice.
  9.  It  is  the intent of the legislature to increase training for law
 enforcement to ensure victims are protected and to prevent future domes-
 tic violence from occurring.
