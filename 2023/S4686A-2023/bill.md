 AN  ACT  to  amend  the criminal procedure law and the executive law, in
  relation to enacting the "New York State Phoenix Act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York
 State Phoenix Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares  all  of
 the following:
  1.  Domestic  violence  is  a pattern of coercive behavior and tactics
 used by someone against their intimate partner in an attempt to gain  or
 maintain  power  and  control  and  types of abuse can include physical,
 sexual, emotional, psychological, technological and  economic  abuse  or
 threats of actions.
  2.  On  average,  one in three women and one in four men in the United
 States experience rape, physical violence, or stalking  by  an  intimate
 partner in their lifetime.
  3.  Between  six  percent  and  fourteen  percent of male offenders of
 domestic violence and between 23 percent and 37 percent of female offen-
 ders of domestic violence report they had been  physically  or  sexually
 abused before the age of 18.
  4.  When  domestic violence occurs in New York state, the time victims
 have to report the incident to  law  enforcement  to  initiate  criminal
 proceedings varies depending on the type of crime committed.

  5.  Research demonstrates that survivors of domestic violence who were
 hesitant to call law  enforcement  frequently  cite  fear  of  reprisal,
 eviction,  arrest,  embarrassment, immigration status and fear of losing
 custody of their children as reasons for their hesitation.
  6.  Due  to systemic racism, which affects social structures, laws and
 policies, Black men and Black  women  experience  domestic  violence  at
 higher rates than other communities. Due to distrust in government agen-
 cies  or law enforcement due to years of discrimination and abuse, Black
 victims experiencing domestic violence  are  less  likely  to  call  law
 enforcement  due to fears of their partner being brutalized or killed by
 the police. On average, Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed
 by police than white men, and Black women are 1.4 times more  likely  to
 be killed by police than white women.
  7.  Black women who report crime to law enforcement are more likely to
 be  criminalized,  prosecuted  and incarcerated while trying to navigate
 and survive the conditions of violence in their lives. Compared to other
 groups, Black women are 80% more likely to be convicted of killing their
 abusive partner when defending themselves from abuse.
  8. Law enforcement officers often have initial contact with victims of
 domestic violence and such response should be viewed as a  serious  call
 for  service  and  an opportunity to provide life-saving engagement with
 victims and connection to community-based supportive services.
  9. It is the intent of the legislature to allow for victims of  domes-
 tic violence to seek justice by extending the statute of limitations for
 reporting family offenses to law enforcement.
  10.  It  is  the  intent  of the legislature to ensure law enforcement
 personnel  receive  comprehensive  survivor-centered,  trauma-informed
 training that is culturally sensitive and appropriate for diverse commu-
 nities.
  §  3.  Subdivision 3 of section 30.10 of the criminal procedure law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows:
  (I) A PROSECUTION OF A FELONY FAMILY OFFENSE  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION

 VISION ONE OF SECTION 530.11 OF THIS CHAPTER WITH A PERIOD OF LIMITATION
 OF  LESS  THAN  FIVE  YEARS  MAY  BE  COMMENCED WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF THE
 COMMISSION THEREOF.
  § 4. Section 214-b of the executive law, as amended by chapter 432  of
 the laws of 2015, is amended to read as follows:
  § 214-b. Family  offense  intervention.  The superintendent shall, for

 for the prevention of domestic violence AND THE NEW YORK STATE COALITION
 AGAINST  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE,  written policies and procedures consistent
