 AN ACT to amend the administrative code of the  city  of  New  York,  in
  relation  to enacting the New York city department of buildings commu-
  nity accountability act
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and
 declares that the health and safety of  the  population  living  in  and
 around  the many construction projects within the densely populated city
 of New York is a matter of state concern as  pressure  mounts  to  build
 more  and  more while completing projects in the shortest time possible.
 Construction is the most dangerous occupation,  with  death  rates  four
 times  the  average  for  other  workers  and  conditions  adjacent  to
 construction sites dangerous to the public.
  A comprehensive public reporting system for the tracking of accidents,
 vacate orders, safety violations, and enforcement actions of the depart-
 ment of buildings is an essential component of assuring greater account-
 ability and transparency in assuring compliance with the  building  code
 and the zoning resolution to improve public safety.
  §  2.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York city
 department of buildings community accountability act".
  § 3. Section 28-103.18.1 of the administrative code of the city of New

  §  28-103.18.1 Complaint records. The department shall keep records of

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
