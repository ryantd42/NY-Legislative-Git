 AN ACT in relation to naming a certain state facility after  Willie  Mae
  "Goody" Goodman
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent: The legislature recognizes the contrib-
 utions of Willie Mae Goodman, a mother and  tireless  advocate  who  has
 devoted  her  life to ensure that people with developmental disabilities
 can have "full" lives in the community.  Since,  1961,  Ms.  Goodman's
 daughter  has  been  under  the  care  of the state department of mental
 hygiene, first at the Willowbrook State school in Staten Island and then
 at Gouverneur Hospital in lower  Manhattan.  Throughout  her  daughter's
 life, Ms. Goodman has fought not only for Margaret's rights, but for the
 rights of other developmentally disabled individuals and their families.
 At  Gouverneur  Hospital  she  led the first group of parents in a court
 action to block the transfer of their loved ones  back  to  Willowbrook.
 She  then  fought  to obtain legal affirmation that Gouverneur residents
 were members of the Willowbrook Class and entitled to the same  benefits
 and  protection. Ms. Goodman continues to advocate for people with disa-
 bilities as part of the Gouverneur Parents Association.  In honor of her
 tireless work for the  developmentally  disabled  community,  the  119th
 street facilities will bear her name.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the official name
 of the  office  for  people  with  developmental  disabilities  facility
 located  in the borough of Manhattan, Block 1807, Lot 18 fully described
 as follows BEGINNING at a point on the northerly side of  119th  Street,
 distant  163 feet westerly from the corner formed by the intersection of
 the northerly side of 119th Street, with the westerly side  of  Pleasant
 Avenue,  running thence northerly parallel with Pleasant Avenue and part
 of the way through a party wall 100 feet  11  inches;  thence  westerly,

 facility pursuant to section two of this act.
