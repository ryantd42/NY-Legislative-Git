 AN  ACT  in  relation  to naming a certain state facility after Lawrence
  "Larry" Jackson

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent: The legislature recognizes the contrib-
 utions  of  Lawrence  Jackson.  A  member of STRIVE, Larry, LJ as he was
 affectionately called, had a rare gift; the ability to see and cultivate
 the talent of others. With over 30 years of workforce experience, and  a
 lifetime of community advocacy, Lawrence Jackson was a game changer, and
 a true Guardian Angel to all who had the opportunity to meet him. LJ was
 a  superhero.  His  powers  allowed  him  to  move with grace and impact
 through the ever-changing social and political climate that he lived in.
 Not only in his immediate community but through the STRIVE  network,  he
 was able to spread his blessings of helping others to a larger community
 both  across the US and abroad (20 sites in the US and in Ireland, Scot-
 land, England and the state of Israel). Additionally, Mr. Jackson served
 as  a president of the board of East Harlem Neighborhood Based  Alliance
 Corporation  (NBA),  where he continued to support the stabilization and
 economic-sufficiency of community residents.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the official  name
 of  the  office  for  people  with  developmental  disabilities facility
 located in the borough of Manhattan, Block 1807, Lot 18 fully  described
 as  follows  BEGINNING at a point on the northerly side of 119th Street,
 distant 163 feet westerly from the corner formed by the intersection  of
 the  northerly  side of 119th Street, with the westerly side of Pleasant
 Avenue, running thence northerly parallel with Pleasant Avenue and  part
 of  the  way  through  a party wall 100 feet 11 inches; thence westerly,

 Street; and thence easterly, along the northerly side of  119th  Street,
 50  feet  to  the  point  or  place  of beginning shall be the "Lawrence
 'Larry' Jackson Community Facility".

 provide  for the installation and maintenance of adequate signing of the
 facility pursuant to section two of this act.
