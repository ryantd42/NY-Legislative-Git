 AN ACT directing the New York state department  of  education,  the  New
  York state department of taxation and finance, and the commissioner of
  taxation  and  finance to study the fiscal impact of funding education
  with state income tax
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that within the
 current  education  funding  system,  which  is based upon real property
 taxation, there are inherent inequities throughout the  state.  Children
 in  different  regions of the state receive varying degrees of education
 and ability to participate in extracurricular activities.  The  legisla-
 ture  finds  that  children  should  not  be  penalized based upon their
 geographic location, a factor that is well beyond their control.  There-
 fore, the legislature intends to determine a method of funding education
 that allows all children to receive the same educational  and  extracur-
 ricular opportunities.
  §  2.  The New York state department of education and the commissioner
 of taxation and finance are hereby authorized and directed to assist the
 New York state department of taxation and finance in preparing a compre-
 hensive study documenting the fiscal implications of using state  income
 taxes to fund education in lieu of using real property taxes.
  Such  study  shall  consider the fiscal impacts on a broad spectrum of
 geographic regions throughout the state. The  study  should  address  as
 many  of  the  inequities in the current education funding system as the
 department of education, the commissioner of taxation and  finance,  and
 the  department  of  taxation and finance can identify. The study should
 include legislative recommendations that  would  help  ensure  a  smooth
 transition  from  a  real  property  tax  based funding mechanism to the
 income tax based funding mechanism. The results of the  study  shall  be

 published  no  later  than one year following the effective date of this
 act. A copy of the results of such  study  shall  be  submitted  to  the
 governor,  the temporary president of the senate, and the speaker of the
 assembly.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
