 AN ACT to amend the public authorities  law,  in  relation  to  commuter

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  The opening paragraph of section 378 of the public author-
 ities law is designated subdivision 1 and a new subdivision 2  is  added
 to read as follows:
  2. (A) THE AUTHORITY IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO ISSUE ANNUAL
 SHORT  DISTANCE  COMMUTER  PERMITS  WHICH SHALL PROVIDE FOR TRAVEL AT NO
 CHARGE BETWEEN INTERCHANGES IN PERMIT AREAS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION, THE TERM "PERMIT AREA" SHALL MEAN THE FOLLOWING  SET  OF  INTER-
 CHANGES:  THIRTY-FOUR-A, THIRTY-FIVE, THIRTY-SIX, THIRTY-SEVEN, THIRTY-
 EIGHT AND THIRTY-NINE. SUCH PERMITS  SHALL  BE  VALID  ONLY  FOR  TRAVEL
 WITHIN  THE  PERMIT  AREA.  THE  AUTHORITY  MAY RESTRICT THE USE OF SUCH
 PERMIT TO PEAK COMMUTER HOURS.
  (B) IF, UPON THE COMPLETION OF  AN  AUDIT  CONDUCTED  BY  A  CERTIFIED
 PUBLIC  ACCOUNTANT  SELECTED  BY THE AUTHORITY, THE AUTHORITY CAN DEMON-
 STRATE THAT THE ISSUANCE OF PERMITS AS AUTHORIZED IN  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION FOR USE DURING PEAK COMMUTER HOURS CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT
 LOSS  OF REVENUE TO THE AUTHORITY, THE AUTHORITY IS AUTHORIZED, PURSUANT
 TO A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD, TO OFFER SUCH PERMITS AT A DISCOUNT OF THE
 CASH COST PER MILE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT, PRIOR TO SUCH BOARD  RESOL-
 UTION,  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL  HOLD  AT  LEAST ONE PUBLIC HEARING IN THE
 PERMIT AREA, AT A TIME AND LOCATION WHICH WILL, TO THE EXTENT  PRACTICA-
 BLE, MAXIMIZE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it  shall  have become a law and shall expire and be deemed repealed ten
 years after such effective date. The thruway authority shall  promulgate
 any  rules  and regulations necessary for the implementation of this act
 on or before such effective date.
