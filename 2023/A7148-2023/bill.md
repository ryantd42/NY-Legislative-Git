 within five days of the conclusion of the hearing or submission  by  the

 elements  of the highest remaining charge would be removable pursuant to
 subdivisions one or two of this section, then the court, sua  sponte  or
 in  response  to  a  motion  pursuant to subdivisions one or two of this
 section by the defendant, shall promptly notify the parties  and  direct
 that  the  matter  proceed  in  accordance  with subdivision one of this
 section, provided, however, that in such instance, the district attorney
 must file any motion to prevent removal within thirty days of  effecting
 or receiving notice of such reduction.

 provided  that such waiver is made by the defendant knowingly, voluntar-
 ily and in open court, in the presence of and with the approval  of  his
 or  her  counsel and the court. An earlier waiver shall not constitute a
 waiver of review and the opportunity for removal under this section.

 action  against an adolescent offender charged with an offense listed in
 paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section 722.23 of this  article,  to
 the  family  court  pursuant  to the provisions of article seven hundred
 twenty-five of this title and upon consideration of the criteria  speci-
 fied  in subdivision two of section 722.22 of this article, it is deter-
 mined that to do so would be in the interests of justice. Where,  howev-

 the first degree as defined in subdivision one of section 130.35 of  the

 A. 7148  4
 
 court  shall, in addition, be based upon a finding of one or more of the
 following factors: (i) mitigating circumstances that bear directly  upon
 the manner in which the crime was committed; or (ii) where the defendant
 was not the sole participant in the crime, the defendant's participation
 was relatively minor although not so minor as to constitute a defense to
 the  prosecution;  or (iii) possible deficiencies in proof of the crime.

 SECTION 722.22 OF THIS ARTICLE.

 WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL IS LIABLE THROUGH ACCESSORIAL CONDUCT AS  DEFINED
 IN SECTION 20.00 OF THE PENAL LAW;

 in the criminal court would serve no useful purpose; AND
