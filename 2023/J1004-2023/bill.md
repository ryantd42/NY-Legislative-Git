  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023, as Meningitis B Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this Legislative Body to increase
awareness of serious illnesses that affect the lives  of  our  citizens;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the sense of this LLegislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Meningitis Awareness  in
the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Meningitis Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Meningococcal  disease,  more  commonly  referred  to  as
bacterial meningitis, is any infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria
meningitidis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Meningococcal  disease  is  uncommon;  however,  when  it
strikes, its flu-like symptoms make diagnosis difficult; and
 
  WHEREAS, Meningococcal disease can cause  serious  illness  such  as
infection  of  the lining of the brain and spinal column (meningitis) or
blood infections (sepsis); the disease strikes quickly and can  lead  to
severe  or  permanent  disabilities, such as hearing loss, brain damage,
seizures, limb amputation or even lead to death within 24-48 hours; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although 1 in 10 people are carriers for this bacteria with
no signs  or  symptoms  of  disease,  sometimes  Neisseria  meningitidis
bacteria can cause illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  different  strains  of  bacterial  meningitis,
including serogroups A, C, W, Y, and  B,  and  vaccines  exist  to  help
provide  protection  against  all  the  serogroups  commonly seen in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The single best way to help prevent all common  strains  of
meningococcal  disease  is  to be vaccinated with both a MenACWY vaccine
and a separate MenB vaccine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Meningococcal disease is spread from person to  person  via
the  exchange  of the bacteria through respiratory and throat secretions
during close or lengthy contact, such as  sharing  beverages  or  eating
utensils, kissing, or spending time in close contact with someone who is
sick or who carries the bacteria; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Community settings in which large groups of people gather,
like  college  campuses,  can  increase  the  risk  of  the  spread  of
meningococcal disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Because  of  the  way  meningitis is spread, through close
personal contact, and that the social  behavior  of  young  adults  ages
17-23  increases  their  risk  of  contracting  the disease; students in
 
dormitory settings and crowded events, are  particularly  vulnerable  to
meningococcal disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  vaccines  for  serogroups  A, C, W, and Y have been
avail- able for many years,  prior  to  2014,  there  were  no  vaccines
available for serogroup B; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite the existence of a serogroup B vaccine, meningitis
B has been responsible for all U.S. college campus outbreaks since 2011,
with some cases resulting in death; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because the B strain of meningitis requires a new, separate
vaccination, students heading to college may mistakenly  think  that  if
they  received  the  MenACWY vaccine that they are protected against all
strains and may not realize they are not protected against the B strain;
and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Centers  for  Disease  Control,  Neisseria
meningitidis  serogroup  B  accounts  for  approximately  half  of  all
meningococcal cases among persons aged 17-23 years in the U.S.; and
 
  WHEREAS, Vaccination for serogroups A,  C,  W  and  Y  is  routinely
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory
Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  recommends  that  decisions  to
vaccinate  adolescents  and  young  adults  16  through  23 years of age
against  serogroup  B  meningococcal  disease  should  be  made  at  the
individual level with health care providers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In accordance with ACIP recommendations, Chapter 401 of the
Laws  of  2015, required that as of September 1, 2016, children entering
grades 7, 8 and 12 be immunized against meningococcal disease strains A,
C, W, and Y; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) § 2167  requires
institutions,  including  colleges  and  universities,  to  distribute
information about meningococcal disease and vaccination to all  students
meeting the enrollment criteria, whether they live on or off campus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  New  York  State  Law  does not require vaccination
against serogroup B meningococcal disease, young adults aged  16-23  may
choose to receive the MenB vaccine series, and are encouraged to discuss
the MenB vaccine with a healthcare provider; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Meningitis  vaccines  are  covered  by  public and private
insurance plans, and individuals are encouraged to contact their  health
insurance plan to determine coverage of MenACWY and MenB vaccines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  federal  Vaccines for Children (VFC) and NYS Vaccines
for Adults (VFA) programs will cover both MenACWY and MenB vaccines  for
children  and  adults  who  have  no  health  insurance  or whose health
insurance does not cover these vaccines, as well as  for  children  less
than  19  years  of  age  who  are  American  Indian or Alaska Native or
eligible for Medicaid or Child Health Plus; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kimberly Coffey was 17 and a high  school  senior  on  Long
Island,  when  she  died  from  meningitis B in 2012 before meningitis B
vaccines were available in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kimberly's  mother,  Patti  Wukovits,  R.N.,  created  the
Kimberly Coffey Foundation and today, this  vital  organization  remains
true to its mission in providing education to the public and health care
professionals  about  meningococcal disease and advocating for two types
of meningococcal vaccination; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Kimberly Coffey Foundation's goal is to ensure that  no
other  family  will  endure  the  loss  of  a  child or have a loved one
experience the devastating effects of meningococcal disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, June 15, 2023, marks the eleventh anniversary  of  Kimberly
Coffey's death; and
 
  WHEREAS, Students, parents, educators and health care providers need
to  know  about all strains of meningitis and how to protect against all
strains; and
 
  WHEREAS, A Meningococcal Disease Fact Sheet is available on the  New
York State Department of Health website; and
 
  WHEREAS, June is a time when students are preparing to go to college
and  can  discuss  how to become fully vaccinated with their health care
provider; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Meningitis B
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  and  Patti  Wukovits,  R.N.,  Executive  Director of the Kimberly
Coffey Foundation.
