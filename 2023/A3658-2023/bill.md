  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "veterans' memorials preservation act".
  § 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this act:
  (a)  a  "memorial"  is  any park, monument, field, open land, grove of
 trees, building, structure, artwork, tablet, plaque, wall, or any  other
 structure  that  has been donated to, or constructed by, a public entity
 as a memorial to veterans of any war, conflict, or police action engaged
 in by the armed forces of the United States, or any state of the  United
 States, or the New York national guard.
  (b) a "public entity" is any governmental body of any kind, including,
 but  not  limited  to, the state, a city, town, village, borough, school
 district or public authority.
  § 3. Memorials shall be preserved and be open to the public.  (a)  Any
 public  entity  that  has created or received a gift of a memorial shall
 not alter, destroy, reconfigure, adjust, change,  modify  or  move  such
 memorial,  or  cause or permit any person to commit such acts; provided,
 however, that such acts are permitted when reasonably necessary.
  (b) Any public entity that has created a memorial or accepted  a  gift
 of a memorial shall maintain the memorial in a reasonable manner.
  (c)  A public entity shall not restrict access to a memorial except as
 reasonably necessary.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
