  COMMEMORATING  the  15th  Anniversary  of
  Communilife's Life is Precious Program
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend organizations and individuals who selflessly work to improve the
quality  of  life  for  others by coming together and discussing ways to
solve common social problems; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 15th  Anniversary  of  Communilife's  Life  is  Precious
Program; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded and led by President and CEO Dr. Rosa Gil, Life is
Precious has provided suicide prevention activities to NYC Latina  teens
who  have  seriously  considered  or  attempted  suicide for the last 15
years; these girls who range in age from 12 to  18,  are  immigrants  or
first-generation  Americans  and  live  in  some  of  New  York  City's
lowest-income neighborhoods; and
 
  WHEREAS, Life is Precious serves New York City and beyond, with four
program sites in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Washington Heights  as
well as newly opened sites in Poughkeepsie and Yonkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Life  is  Precious' program philosophy of "Survive, Strive
and Thrive" is achieved through academic support,  wellness  activities,
expressive arts therapy and family services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Life  is  Precious  is  a  safe  place in which to receive
support, offer activities that allow the teen to  develop  their  unique
voice,  and  provide  tools  that  help teens envision and achieve their
goals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr.  Rosa  Gil  founded  Communilife  in  1989  to  provide
vulnerable  communities  with  culturally  sensitive  services to lead a
healthy and meaningful life, and since then, she has  worked  tirelessly
to fulfill these goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2022, Communilife served more than 3,000 low-income and
vulnerable New Yorkers, 90% of whom are African American and 50% of whom
have Spanish as their primary or sole language, and all of whom struggle
with profound challenges including chronic  homelessness,  HIV/AIDS  and
other  major medical issues, serious mental illnesses, and substance use
disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 15th  Anniversary  of  Communilife's  Life  is  Precious
Program; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Dr. Rosa Gil, Founder, President, and CEO of Communilife.
