 AN ACT to amend the state finance law, in  relation  to  requiring  that
  bidders and all others seeking state contracts disclose their percent-
  age and number of female executives and board members

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that there  is  a
 growing body of evidence that companies perform better when their boards
 and  executive leadership are strongly represented by women and that the
 state has a vested interest in ensuring that companies receiving  public
 funds  and  contracts  perform  efficiently  to  maintain a high rate of
 success.  Further, the legislature finds that it is in the state's vest-
 ed interest to encourage equitable and diverse gender representation  on
 corporate  boards  of companies receiving public funds and contracts. It
 is the intent of this act to require companies who wish to  do  business
 with  the  state  to disclose the current percentage and number of women
 executive officers employed by the company,  percentage  and  number  of
 women  on its corporate board, and the company's goals for the increased
 participation of women in executive positions and on corporate boards.
  § 2. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section  149  to
 read as follows:
  § 149. DISCLOSURE OF WOMEN IN EXECUTIVE POSITIONS AND SERVING AS BOARD
 MEMBERS  BY  STATE  CONTRACTORS. 1. ALL CONTRACT SOLICITATIONS INCLUDING
