 second  degree  or coercion in the third degree as set forth in subdivi-
 sions one, two and three of section 135.60  of  the  penal  law  between
 spouses  or  former  spouses,  or  between  parent  and child or between
 members  of  the  same family or household except that if the respondent
 would not be criminally responsible by reason of age pursuant to section
 30.00 of the penal law, then  the  family  court  shall  have  exclusive
 jurisdiction  over  such  proceeding.  Notwithstanding a complainant's
 election to proceed in family court, the criminal  court  shall  not  be
 divested of jurisdiction to hear a family offense proceeding pursuant to
 this  section. In any proceeding pursuant to this article, a court shall
 not deny an order of protection, or dismiss a petition,  solely  on  the
 basis that the acts or events alleged are not relatively contemporaneous
 with the date of the petition, the conclusion of the fact-finding or the
 conclusion  of  the dispositional hearing. For purposes of this article,
 "disorderly conduct" includes disorderly conduct not in a public  place.
 For  purposes of this article, "members of the same family or household"
 shall mean the following:
  (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;
  (b) persons legally married to one another;
  (c) persons formerly married to one another regardless of whether they
 still reside in the same household;
  (d) persons who have a child in  common  regardless  of  whether  such
 persons have been married or have lived together at any time; [and]
  (e)  persons  who are not related by consanguinity or affinity and who
 are or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether  such
 persons  have lived together at any time. Factors the court may consider
 in determining whether a  relationship  is  an  "intimate  relationship"
 include  but  are  not  limited  to: the nature or type of relationship,
 regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequen-
 cy of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relation-
 ship. Neither a casual acquaintance nor ordinary fraternization  between
 two  individuals  in  business  or  social  contexts  shall be deemed to
 constitute an "intimate relationship"[.]; AND
  (F) PERSONS WHO ARE NOT RELATED BY CONSANGUINITY, AFFINITY, OR INTIMA-
 CY AND WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN PARTY TO UNRECIPROCATED  OFFENSIVE  CONTACT.
 "UNRECIPROCATED  OFFENSIVE  CONTACT"  SHALL  BE  DEFINED AS A PATTERN OF
 COMMUNICATION OR ACTIVITY WHEREIN ONE PERSON (THE RESPONDENT) IS ENGAGED
 IN PRIMARILY ONE-SIDED ASSAULTIVE OR THREATENING CONDUCT AND/OR A COURSE
 OF REPEATED, UNWELCOME COMMUNICATION AT OR  ABOUT  ANOTHER  PERSON  (THE
 PETITIONER).  FACTORS  THE  COURT MAY CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN
 ALLEGED OFFENDER IS ENGAGING IN UNRECIPROCATED OFFENSIVE CONTACT INCLUDE
 BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: THE EXTENT  TO  WHICH  THE  PETITIONER  HAS  NOT
 CONSENTED  TO  SUCH CONTACT, THE VOLUME AND FREQUENCY OF SUCH CONTACT BY
 THE RESPONDENT, THE COERCIVE, THREATENING, AND/OR HARASSING  CONTENT  OF
 ANY  COMMUNICATIONS  SENT  BY THE RESPONDENT, AND THE SERIOUSNESS AND/OR
 ONE-SIDEDNESS OF SUCH CONTACT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
