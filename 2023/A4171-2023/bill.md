 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and  traffic  law  and  the  penal  law,  in
  relation to the ignition interlock program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares:
  1.  In  2009, New York adopted "Leandra's Law" to require, as a condi-
 tion of sentence, that all individuals convicted of the crime of driving
 while intoxicated install an ignition interlock device (IID) for a spec-
 ified time in any vehicle they own or operate.  Fifteen  years  later,
 despite  the  mandate,  only  three in ten offenders actually install an
 IID.
  2. In addition, although the  penalty  model  based  predominantly  on
 license  revocation  persists,  far too many offenders continue to drive
 even after losing their  license privilege, and a significant number  of
 them  continue to drive under the influence of alcohol.  The consensus
 among highway safety experts is that well over  fifty  percent,  and  as
 many as eighty percent, of revoked drivers continue to drive while unli-
 censed.
  3.  IIDs  are  designed  to  do  two things: (1) protect the public by
 preventing drunk driving events; and (2) alter driver behavior to reduce
 recidivism. Numerous studies have shown IIDs to be overwhelmingly effec-
 tive on both counts:
  (a) Public safety. Between December 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020, IID
 installation stopped 3.8 million drivers nationally from  attempting  to
 drive  while  legally  intoxicated  (.08+) and foiled an additional 25.4
 million drivers from attempting to drive after consuming enough  alcohol

 to trigger the IID's set point.  Over the same time period in New York -
 even despite the poor compliance rate - IIDs prevented more than 111,000
 legally  drunk  drivers  and  foiled  an  additional 439,427 attempts by
 convicted drunk drivers who attempted to start a vehicle after consuming
 alcohol.
  (b)  Reduced recidivism. A 2016 University of Pennsylvania study found
 that alcohol-related fatalities decreased by 15% in states with  all-of-
 fender interlock laws. Similarly, a 2016 California study concluded that
 ignition  interlock  devices  are seventy-four percent more effective in
 reducing DWI recidivism than license suspension alone during  the  first
 six  months  after conviction and forty-five percent more effective over
 the course of a year.
  4. Given the empirical data that favors the use of the IID as a condi-
 tion of sentence, either in conjunction with or instead of license revo-
 cation, the legislature finds that New  York  has  fallen  significantly
 behind  other  states  that  utilize  IIDs  to promote public safety and
 support rehabilitative efforts.  Accordingly, the  legislature  declares
 that  to  further  advance public safety, New York must adopt best prac-
 tices consistent with the data for model use of the  ignition  interlock
 device as a proven method for saving lives and promoting rehabilitation.

 A. 4171  10
 
 of  probation,  installation  and maintenance of such ignition interlock
 device shall be a condition of probation.
  (b)  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall prohibit a court, upon
 application by a probation department, from modifying the conditions  of
 probation  of  any  person convicted of any violation set forth in para-

  3. Conditions. (a) [Notwithstanding any other provision of law] EXCEPT
 AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR SENTENCES IMPOSED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (G) OF
 SUBDIVISION  ONE OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-THREE OF THIS ARTICLE,
 the commissioner may grant a post-revocation conditional license, as set
 forth in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, to a  person  who  has  been
 convicted of a violation of subdivision two, two-a [or], three OR FOUR-A
 of  section  eleven  hundred ninety-two of this article and who has been

 lished  by  law  and the commissioner has been notified that such person
 may operate only a motor vehicle equipped with  a  functioning  ignition

 ter  during  the  license revocation period or deemed by a court to have
 violated any condition of probation or conditional discharge  set  forth
 by  the  court  relating  to  the  operation  of  a motor vehicle or the
 consumption of alcohol. In exercising discretion relating to  the  issu-
 ance  of a post-revocation conditional license pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion, the commissioner shall not deny such issuance  based  solely  upon
 the  number  of convictions for violations of any subdivision of section
 eleven hundred ninety-two of this article committed by such person with-
 in the ten years prior to application for such license. Upon the  termi-
 nation  of  the  period of probation or conditional discharge set by the

 license  or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in accordance with this
 chapter.
  (b) Notwithstanding any inconsistent  provision  of  this  chapter,  a
 post-revocation conditional license granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of
 this  subdivision shall be valid only for use by the holder thereof, (1)
 [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from the holder's place of employment, (2)  if
 the  holder's  employment requires the operation of a motor vehicle then
 during the hours thereof, (3) [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a class  or
 course  at  an  accredited  school,  college or university or at a state
 approved institution of vocational or technical  training,  (4)  to  and
 from court ordered probation activities, (5) to and from a motor vehicle
 office for the transaction of business relating to such license, (6) for
 a  three hour consecutive daytime period, chosen by the department, on a
 day during which the participant is not engaged in usual  employment  or
 vocation,  (7)  [enroute]  EN ROUTE to and from a medical examination or
 treatment as part of a necessary medical treatment for such  participant
 or  member  of  the  participant's  household, as evidenced by a written
 A. 4171  11
 
 statement to that effect  from  a  licensed  medical  practitioner,  (8)
 [enroute]  EN  ROUTE  to  and  from  a  class or an activity which is an
 authorized part of the alcohol and drug rehabilitation  program  and  at
 which  participant's  attendance is required, and (9) [enroute] EN ROUTE
 to and from a place, including a school, at which a child or children of
 the participant are cared for on a regular basis and which is  necessary
 for the participant to maintain such participant's employment or enroll-
 ment  at  an  accredited  school,  college  or  university or at a state
 approved institution of vocational or technical training.
  (c) The post-revocation conditional license described in this subdivi-
 sion may be revoked by the commissioner for sufficient  cause  including
 but not limited to, failure to comply with the terms of the condition of
 probation or conditional discharge set forth by the court, conviction of
 any traffic offense other than one involving parking, stopping or stand-
 ing [or], conviction of any alcohol or drug related offense, misdemeanor
 or  felony,  ANY  VIOLATION  OF THIS ARTICLE WITH RESPECT TO OPERATING A
 MOTOR VEHICLE WITHOUT  A  FUNCTIONING  IGNITION  INTERLOCK  DEVICE  WHEN
 REQUIRED  TO  DO  SO,  or failure to install or maintain a court ordered
 ignition interlock device.
  (d) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the court from  requiring,
 as  a  condition of probation or conditional discharge, the installation
 of a functioning ignition interlock device in any vehicle owned or oper-
 ated by a person sentenced for a violation of  subdivision  two,  two-a,
 [or] three OR FOUR-A of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this [chap-
 ter]  ARTICLE,  or any crime defined by this chapter or the penal law of
 which an alcohol-related violation of any provision  of  section  eleven
 hundred ninety-two of this [chapter] ARTICLE is an essential element, if
 the  court in its discretion, determines that such a condition is neces-
 sary to ensure the public safety. Imposition of  an  ignition  interlock
 condition  shall  in  no  way  limit the effect of any period of license
 suspension or revocation set forth by the commissioner or the court.
  (e) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the court from applying any
 other conditions of probation or conditional discharge allowed  by  law,
 including treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, restitution and community
 service.
  (f) The commissioner shall note on the operator's record of any person
 restricted  pursuant  to  this  section  that,  in addition to any other
 restrictions, conditions or limitations, such person may operate only  a
 motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device.
  4.  Proof  of  compliance  and recording of condition.  (a) Following
 imposition by the court of the use of an ignition interlock device as  a
 condition PLEA, SENTENCE, of probation or conditional discharge it shall
 require  the  person to provide proof of compliance with this section to
 the court and the probation  department  or  other  monitor  where  such
 person is under probation or conditional discharge supervision.  A CLAIM
 BY  SUCH  PERSON  THAT  HE  OR  SHE HAS GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT INSTALLING AN
 IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE SHALL BE  MADE  TO  THE  COURT  AT  OR  BEFORE
 SENTENCING,  IN  WRITING IN THE FORM OF A SWORN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY SUCH
 PERSON ASSERTING UNDER OATH THAT: (1) HE OR SHE IS NOT THE REGISTERED OR
 TITLED OWNER OF ANY MOTOR VEHICLE AND WILL NOT OPERATE ANY MOTOR VEHICLE
 DURING THE PERIOD OF RESTRICTION; AND (2) THAT SUCH PERSON DOES NOT HAVE
 ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE OPERATED  BY  SUCH  PERSON  AT  THE  TIME  OF  THE
 VIOLATION  OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE; AND (C)
 THAT THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THAT VEHICLE OR ANY VEHICLE  REGISTERED  TO
 SUCH PERSON'S HOUSEHOLD WILL NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AN
 INTERLOCK  DEVICE  ON  HIS OR HER VEHICLE. THE AFFIDAVIT SHALL INCLUDE A
 A. 4171  12
 
 STATEMENT REGARDING WHETHER SUCH PERSON OWNED ANY MOTOR VEHICLE  ON  THE
 DATE OF THE UNDERLYING VIOLATION OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  AND  WHETHER  OWNERSHIP OF ANY OF THOSE VEHICLES HAS BEEN
 TRANSFERRED  TO ANOTHER PARTY BY SALE, GIFT OR ANY OTHER MEANS SINCE THE
 DATE OF SAID VIOLATION. THE AFFIDAVIT SHALL  ALSO  INCLUDE  A  STATEMENT
 FROM  SUCH PERSON THAT HE OR SHE HAS NOT AND WILL NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP
 OF ANY VEHICLE TO EVADE INSTALLATION OF AN  IGNITION  INTERLOCK  DEVICE,
 THE  ADDRESS  OF  SUCH  PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT, IF APPLICABLE, AND HOW SUCH
 PERSON  INTENDS  TO  TRAVEL  TO  THAT  LOCATION  DURING  THE  PERIOD  OF
 RESTRICTION.  THE  PERSON  ALSO  MAY INCLUDE ANY OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUM-
 STANCES HE OR SHE BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT TO THE CLAIM  OF  GOOD  CAUSE.
 THE  COURT  SHALL MAKE A FINDING WHETHER GOOD CAUSE EXISTS ON THE RECORD
 AND, IF GOOD CAUSE SHALL BE FOUND, ISSUE SUCH FINDING IN WRITING  TO  BE
 FILED  BY  SUCH  PERSON  WITH  THE  PROBATION DEPARTMENT OR THE IGNITION
 INTERLOCK MONITOR, AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE EVENT THE  COURT  DENIES  SUCH
 PERSON'S  CLAIM  OF  GOOD CAUSE ON THE BASIS OF THE AFFIDAVIT FILED WITH
 THE COURT, SUCH PERSONS SHALL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.  SUCH
 PERSON  SHALL ALSO BE PERMITTED TO WAIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, IF
 HE OR SHE CHOOSES TO DO SO. If  [the]  A  person  SHALL  BE  ORDERED  TO
 INSTALL AND MAINTAIN AN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE, AND SUCH PERSON fails
 to provide for such proof of installation, absent a finding by the court
 of good cause for that failure which is entered in the record, the court
 may  revoke,  modify, or terminate the person's sentence of probation or
 conditional discharge as provided under law.  [Good cause may include  a
 finding  that  the  person  is  not the owner of a motor vehicle if such
 person asserts under oath that such person is not the owner of any motor
 vehicle and that he or she will not operate any motor vehicle during the
 period of interlock restriction except as may  be  otherwise  authorized
 pursuant  to  law.]  "Owner"  shall have the same meaning as provided in
 section one hundred twenty-eight of this chapter.
  (b) When a court imposes the condition specified in subdivision one of
 this section, the court shall notify the commissioner in such manner  as
 the  commissioner  may  prescribe,  and the commissioner shall note such
 condition on the operating record of the person subject to  such  condi-
 tions.
  5. Cost, installation and maintenance.  (a) The cost of installing and
 maintaining  the  ignition interlock device shall be borne by the person
 subject to such condition unless the court  determines  such  person  is
 financially  unable  to  afford  such  cost  whereupon  such cost may be
 imposed pursuant to a payment plan or waived.  In  the  event  of  such
 waiver,  the  cost of the device shall be borne in accordance with regu-
 lations issued under paragraph (g) of subdivision one of section  eleven
 hundred ninety-three of this article or pursuant to such other agreement
 as  may  be entered into for provision of the device. Such cost shall be
 considered a fine for the purposes of subdivision five of section 420.10
 of the criminal procedure law. Such cost shall not  replace,  but  shall
 instead be in addition to, any fines, surcharges, or other costs imposed
 pursuant to this chapter or other applicable laws.
  (b)  The  installation  and  service  provider  of the device shall be
 responsible for the installation, calibration, and maintenance  of  such

 OR TAMPERING WITH THE DEVICE, IN VIOLATION OF REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY
 THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, SHALL CONSTITUTE A  VIOLATION

 DISCHARGE.
