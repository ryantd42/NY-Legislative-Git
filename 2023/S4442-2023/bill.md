 Introduced by Sen. FERNANDEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law and the tax law, in relation to
  enacting  the  "New York State Transparency in Supply Chains Act", and
  to require businesses within the state to disclose their  preventative
  measures against human trafficking
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York state transparency in supply chains act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that human traf-
 ficking  is a crime under state, federal and international law, and that
 these crimes exist in every country, including the  United  States,  and
 the state of New York. As a result of the criminal nature of human traf-
 ficking,  this  crime  is often difficult to uncover and track.  Signif-
 icant legislative efforts have been  made  to  capture  and  punish  the
 perpetrators  of  this  crime  and  also to ensure that victims of human
 trafficking are provided with  the  necessary  rights  and  protections.
 However,  legislative  efforts  to  address  the  market  for  goods and
 products tainted by human trafficking have been lacking, with the market
 being a key impetus for these crimes. Studies have shown that  a  number
 of  goods  from all over the world are believed to be produced by forced
 labor or child  labor  in  violation  of  international  standards,  and
 consumers  and  businesses  are  inadvertently promoting and sanctioning
 these crimes through the purchase of goods and products that  have  been
 tainted  in  the  supply  chain.  Absent  public  available disclosures,
 consumers are at a disadvantage in being able to  distinguish  companies
 on the merits of their efforts to supply products free from the taint of
 human  trafficking.  Consumers  are  at  a disadvantage in being able to
 force the eradication of human trafficking by way  of  their  purchasing
 decisions. The purpose of this law is to ensure that large retailers and

 manufacturers  provide  consumers  with  accurate  information regarding
 their efforts to eradicate human trafficking  from  their  supply  chain
 processes,  to  educate  consumers  on how to purchase goods produced by
 companies  that responsibly manage their supply chains, and, thereby, to
 improve the lives of victims of human trafficking.
