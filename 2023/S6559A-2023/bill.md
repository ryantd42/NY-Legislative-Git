  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS:  Currently,  correction officers who are
 determined to be disabled by the NYCERS' Medical Board, and have accumu-
 lated at least 10 years of service credit, are eligible for an immediate
 ordinary disability retirement (ODR) allowance equal to the  greater  of
 1/3 of Final Average Salary (FAS), or 1/60 of FAS multiplied by credited
 service.
  If the correction officer is also eligible for Service Retirement, the
 ODR  benefit  cannot  be  less than the retirement allowance for Service
 Retirement.
  Under the proposed legislation, the ODR benefit would become available
 to disabled correction officers, subject to approval under the  applica-
 ble  statutes  and  procedures  established  by  NYCERS, irrespective of
 service credit accumulation.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  *  The  proposed Section 507-a benefit is assumed to only be available
 to eligible correction officers prospectively on and after the effective
 date of the legislation.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: Marek Tyszkiewicz and Gregory Zelikov-
 sky are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy  of
 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy  of  Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
 To the best of our knowledge, the results  contained  herein  have  been
 prepared  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and
 procedures and with the Actuarial Standards of Practice  issued  by  the
 Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL  NOTE  IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-31 dated March 19,
 2024 was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City  Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
