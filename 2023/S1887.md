  2-A.  UPON NOTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISIONS ONE OR  TWO  OF  THIS

 OFFENDER'S PROPOSED RESIDENCE IS NOT WITHIN THE AREA DEFINED  AS  SCHOOL

 SUBDIVISION  TWENTY-TWO  OF SECTION 10.00 OF THE PENAL LAW, THE MEASURE-
 MENTS TO BE TAKEN IN STRAIGHT LINES FROM THE  CENTER  OF  THE  NEAREST
 ENTRANCE  OF  THE  RESIDENCE  TO THE NEAREST REAL PROPERTY BOUNDARY LINE

 vision 3 as amended by chapter 11 of the laws of 2002,  are  amended  to

 payment of a fine,  conditional  discharge  or  unconditional  discharge
 shall,  prior  to  such  release or discharge, be informed of his or her
 duty to register under this article by the court in which he or she  was
 convicted.  At  the  time  sentence  is imposed, such sex offender shall

 form obtain the address where the sex offender expects  to  reside  upon
 his or her release, and the name and address of any institution of high-
 er education he or she expects to be employed by, enrolled in, attending
 or  employed,  whether  for  compensation  or not, and whether he or she
 expects to reside in a facility owned or operated by  such  an  institu-
 tion, and shall report such information to the division. The court shall
 give  one copy of the form to the sex offender and shall send two copies
 to the division which shall forward the information to the law  enforce-
 ment  agencies  having  jurisdiction.  The  court  shall also notify the
 district attorney and the sex offender of the date of the  determination
 proceeding  to  be  held  pursuant to subdivision three of this section,
 which shall be held at least forty-five days after such notice is given.
 This notice shall include the following  statement  or  a  substantially
 similar  statement:  "This proceeding is being held to determine whether
 you will be classified as a level 3 offender (risk of repeat offense  is
 high),  a  level  2  offender (risk of repeat offense is moderate), or a
 level 1 offender (risk of repeat offense is low), or whether you will be
 designated as a sexual predator, a sexually violent offender or a predi-
 cate sex offender, which will determine how long you must register as  a
 sex  offender, WHERE YOU MAY RESIDE, WORK OR TRAVEL, and how much infor-
 mation can be provided to the public concerning  your  registration.  If
 you  fail  to  appear  at this proceeding, without sufficient excuse, it
 shall be held in your absence. Failure to appear may result in a  longer
 period  of  registration  or  a  higher  level of community notification
 because you are not  present  to  offer  evidence  or  contest  evidence
 offered  by the district attorney."  The court shall also advise the sex
 offender that he or she has a right to a hearing prior  to  the  court's
 determination, that he or she has the right to be represented by counsel
 at the hearing and that counsel will be appointed if he or she is finan-
 cially unable to retain counsel. If the sex offender applies for assign-
 ment  of  counsel to represent him or her at the hearing and counsel was
 not previously assigned to represent the sex offender in the  underlying
 criminal  action,  the  court  shall  determine  whether the offender is
 financially unable to retain counsel.  If such a finding  is  made,  the
 court  shall  assign  counsel  to represent the sex offender pursuant to
 article eighteen-B of the county law.  Where  the  court  orders  a  sex
 offender  released  on  probation,  such  order must include a provision
 requiring that he or she comply with the requirements of  this  article.
 Where  such sex offender violates such provision, probation may be imme-
 diately revoked in the manner provided by article four  hundred  ten  of
 the criminal procedure law.
  3.  For sex offenders released on probation or discharged upon payment
 of a fine, conditional discharge or unconditional discharge, it shall be
 the duty of the court applying the guidelines established in subdivision
 five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article  to  determine
 the  level  of  notification  pursuant to subdivision six of section one
 hundred sixty-eight-l of this article  and  whether  such  sex  offender
 shall  be  designated  a  sexual predator, sexually violent offender, or
 predicate sex offender as defined in subdivision seven  of  section  one
 hundred  sixty-eight-a  of  this article. At least fifteen days prior to
 the determination proceeding, the district attorney shall provide to the
 court and the sex offender a written statement setting forth the  deter-
 minations  sought by the district attorney together with the reasons for
 seeking such determinations. The court shall allow the sex  offender  to
 appear and be heard. The state shall appear by the district attorney, or
 his  or  her  designee,  who  shall bear the burden of proving the facts
 S. 1887  3
 
 supporting the determinations sought by clear and  convincing  evidence.
 Where  there  is  a  dispute between the parties concerning the determi-
 nations, the court shall adjourn the hearing as necessary to permit  the
 sex  offender  or  the district attorney to obtain materials relevant to
 the determinations from any state or local facility, hospital,  institu-
 tion,  office,  agency,  department  or  division. Such materials may be
 obtained by subpoena if  not  voluntarily  provided  to  the  requesting
 party. In making the determinations, the court shall review any victim's
 statement  and  any relevant materials and evidence submitted by the sex
 offender and the district attorney and the court may  consider  reliable
 hearsay  evidence submitted by either party provided that it is relevant
 to the determinations. Facts previously proven at trial or  elicited  at
 the  time  of  entry  of a plea of guilty shall be deemed established by
 clear and convincing evidence and shall not be  relitigated.  The  court
 shall  render an order setting forth its determinations and the findings
 of fact and conclusions of law on which the  determinations  are  based,
 SUCH  ORDER  SHALL  ALSO  INCLUDE ANY CONDITIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE
 IMPOSED PURSUANT TO SECTION 65.10 OF THE PENAL LAW. A copy of the  order
 shall  be  submitted  by  the court to the division. Upon application of
 either party, the court shall seal any portion  of  the  court  file  or
 record  which  contains material that is confidential under any state or
 federal statute. Either party may appeal as  of  right  from  the  order
 pursuant  to the provisions of articles fifty-five, fifty-six and fifty-
 seven of the civil practice  law  and  rules.  Where  counsel  has  been
 assigned  to  represent  the  sex  offender upon the ground that the sex
 offender is financially unable to retain counsel, that assignment  shall
 be  continued  throughout the pendency of the appeal, and the person may
 appeal as a poor person pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of  the  county
 law.
  §  3.  Section  168-f of the correction law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 4-a to read as follows:
  4-A. A SEX OFFENDER WHO HAS ESTABLISHED A RESIDENCE SHALL  NOT  CHANGE
 SAID  RESIDENCE  SO  AS  TO  RESIDE  WITHIN  THE  AREA DEFINED AS SCHOOL
 GROUNDS, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  FOURTEEN  OF  SECTION
 220.00  OF  THE  PENAL  LAW, OR A PLAYGROUND, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN
 SUBDIVISION TWENTY-TWO OF SECTION 10.00 OF THE PENAL LAW,  THE  MEASURE-
 MENTS  TO  BE  TAKEN  IN  STRAIGHT  LINES FROM THE CENTER OF THE NEAREST
 ENTRANCE OF THE RESIDENCE TO THE REAL PROPERTY BOUNDARY LINE  COMPRISING
 SUCH SCHOOL GROUNDS OR PLAYGROUND.
  §  4. Subdivision 2 of section 168-k of the correction law, as amended
 by chapter 684 of the laws of 2005, is amended to read as follows:
  2. The division shall advise the  board  that  the  sex  offender  has
 established  residence  in this state. The board shall determine whether
 the sex offender is required to register with the  division.  If  it  is
 determined  that  the sex offender is required to register, the division
 shall notify the sex offender of his or her duty to register under  this
 article  and  shall  require  the  sex offender to sign a form as may be
 required by the division acknowledging that the duty to register and the
 procedure for registration has been explained to the sex  offender.  The
 division  shall  obtain  on such form the address where the sex offender
 expects to reside within the state and the sex offender shall retain one
 copy of the form and send two copies to the division which shall provide
 the information to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction  where
 the  sex  offender  expects  to  reside within this state. No later than
 thirty days prior to the board making a recommendation, the sex offender
 shall be notified that his or her case is under review and  that  he  or
 S. 1887  4
 
 she  is permitted to submit to the board any information relevant to the
 review. After reviewing  any  information  obtained,  and  applying  the
 guidelines  established  in  subdivision  five  of  section  one hundred
 sixty-eight-l  of  this  article,  the board shall within sixty calendar
 days make a recommendation regarding the level of notification  pursuant
 to  subdivision six of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article
 and whether such sex offender shall be  designated  a  sexual  predator,
 sexually  violent  offender,  or  predicate  sex  offender as defined in
 subdivision seven of section one hundred sixty-eight-a of this  article.
 This recommendation shall be confidential and shall not be available for
 public  inspection.  It  shall  be  submitted by the board to the county
 court or supreme court and to the district attorney  in  the  county  of
 residence  of  the sex offender and to the sex offender. It shall be the
 duty of the county court or supreme court in the county of residence  of
 the  sex  offender,  applying  the guidelines established in subdivision
 five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article, to  determine
 the  level  of  notification  pursuant to subdivision six of section one
 hundred sixty-eight-l of this article  and  whether  such  sex  offender
 shall  be  designated  a  sexual predator, sexually violent offender, or
 predicate sex offender as defined in subdivision seven  of  section  one
 hundred sixty-eight-a of this article. At least thirty days prior to the
 determination  proceeding, such court shall notify the district attorney
 and the sex offender, in writing,  of  the  date  of  the  determination
 proceeding  and  the  court shall also provide the district attorney and
 sex offender with a copy of the recommendation received from  the  board
 and  any  statement  of the reasons for the recommendation received from
 the board. This notice  shall  include  the  following  statement  or  a
 substantially  similar  statement:  "This  proceeding  is  being held to
 determine whether you will be classified as a level 3 offender (risk  of
 repeat  offense  is high), a level 2 offender (risk of repeat offense is
 moderate), or a level 1 offender (risk of repeat  offense  is  low),  or
 whether  you will be designated as a sexual predator, a sexually violent
 offender or a predicate sex offender, which will determine how long  you
 must  register  as a sex offender, WHERE YOU MAY RESIDE, WORK OR TRAVEL,
 and how much information can be provided to the public  concerning  your
 registration.  If  you fail to appear at this proceeding, without suffi-
 cient excuse, it shall be held in your absence. Failure  to  appear  may
 result in a longer period of registration or a higher level of community
 notification  because  you  are not present to offer evidence or contest
 evidence offered by the district attorney."  The court shall also advise
 the sex offender that he or she has a right to a hearing  prior  to  the
 court's determination, that he or she has the right to be represented by
 counsel  at  the hearing and that counsel will be appointed if he or she
 is financially unable to retain counsel.  A  returnable  form  shall  be
 enclosed  in  the  court's  notice  to the sex offender on which the sex
 offender may apply for assignment of  counsel.  If  the  sex  offender
 applies  for assignment of counsel and the court finds that the offender
 is financially unable to retain counsel, the court shall assign  counsel
 to  represent  the  sex  offender  pursuant to article eighteen-B of the
 county law. If the district attorney seeks a determination that  differs
 from  the recommendation submitted by the board, at least ten days prior
 to the determination proceeding the district attorney shall  provide  to
 the  court  and  the sex offender a statement setting forth the determi-
 nations sought by the district attorney together with  the  reasons  for
 seeking  such  determinations. The court shall allow the sex offender to
 appear and be heard. The state shall appear by the district attorney, or
 S. 1887  5
 
 his or her designee, who shall bear the  burden  of  proving  the  facts
 supporting  the  determinations sought by clear and convincing evidence.
 It shall be the duty of the court applying the guidelines established in
 subdivision five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article to
 determine  the  level  of  notification  pursuant  to subdivision six of
 section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article and whether  such  sex
 offender  shall be designated a sexual predator, sexually violent offen-
 der, or predicate sex  offender  as  defined  in  subdivision  seven  of
 section  one  hundred  sixty-eight-a  of  this article. Where there is a
 dispute between the parties concerning  the  determinations,  the  court
 shall adjourn the hearing as necessary to permit the sex offender or the
 district  attorney  to  obtain  materials relevant to the determinations
 from the state board of examiners of sex offenders or any state or local
 facility, hospital, institution, office, agency, department or division.
 Such materials may be obtained by subpoena if not  voluntarily  provided
 to  the  requesting  party. In making the determinations the court shall
 review any victim's statement and any relevant  materials  and  evidence
 submitted  by  the sex offender and the district attorney and the recom-
 mendation and any material submitted by  the  board,  and  may  consider
 reliable hearsay evidence submitted by either party, provided that it is
 relevant  to  the determinations. If available, facts proven at trial or
 elicited at the time of a plea of guilty shall be deemed established  by
 clear  and  convincing  evidence and shall not be relitigated. The court
 shall render an order setting forth its determinations and the  findings
 of  fact  and  conclusions of law on which the determinations are based,
 SUCH ORDER SHALL ALSO INCLUDE ANY CONDITIONS THAT  ARE  REQUIRED  TO  BE
 IMPOSED  PURSUANT TO SECTION 65.10 OF THE PENAL LAW. A copy of the order
 shall be submitted by the court to the  division.  Upon  application  of
 either  party,  the  court  shall  seal any portion of the court file or
 record which contains material that is confidential under any  state  or
 federal  statute.  Either  party  may  appeal as of right from the order
 pursuant to the provisions of articles fifty-five, fifty-six and  fifty-
 seven  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules. Where counsel has been
 assigned to represent the sex offender upon  the  ground  that  the  sex
 offender  is financially unable to retain counsel, that assignment shall
 be continued throughout the pendency of the appeal, and the  person  may
 appeal  as  a  poor  person pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county
 law.
  § 5. Subdivision 3 of section 168-n of the correction law, as  amended
 by chapter 684 of the laws of 2005, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  No later than thirty days prior to the board's recommendation, the
 sex offender shall be notified that his or her case is under review  and
 that he or she is permitted to submit to the board any information rele-
 vant  to  the  review.  Upon  receipt of the board's recommendation, the
 sentencing court shall determine whether the sex offender was previously
 found to be eligible for assigned counsel in the underlying case.  Where
 such  a  finding  was previously made, the court shall assign counsel to
 represent the offender, pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of  the  county
 law.  At  least  twenty  days prior to the determination proceeding, the
 sentencing court shall notify the district attorney,  the  sex  offender
 and  the sex offender's counsel, in writing, of the date of the determi-
 nation proceeding and shall also provide the district attorney, the  sex
 offender  and  the sex offender's counsel with a copy of the recommenda-
 tion received from the board and any statement of the  reasons  for  the
 recommendation  received  from  the board. This notice shall include the
 following  statement  or  a  substantially  similar  statement:  "This
 S. 1887  6
 
 proceeding  is being held to determine whether you will be classified as
 a level 3 offender (risk of repeat offense is high), a level 2  offender
 (risk  of  repeat  offense  is moderate), or a level 1 offender (risk of
 repeat  offense  is  low), or whether you will be designated as a sexual
 predator, a sexually violent offender or a predicate sex offender, which
 will determine how long you must register as a sex offender,  WHERE  YOU
 MAY  RESIDE, WORK OR TRAVEL, and how much information can be provided to
 the public concerning your registration. If you fail to appear  at  this
 proceeding, without sufficient excuse, it shall be held in your absence.
 Failure  to  appear  may  result in a longer period of registration or a
 higher level of community notification because you are  not  present  to
 offer  evidence  or  contest evidence offered by the district attorney."
 The written notice to the sex offender shall also  advise  the  offender
 that  he  or  she has a right to a hearing prior to the court's determi-
 nation, and that he or she has the right to be represented by counsel at
 the hearing. If counsel has been assigned to represent the  offender  at
 the  determination  proceeding,  the notice shall also provide the name,
 address and telephone number of the assigned counsel. Where counsel  has
 not been assigned, the notice shall advise the sex offender that counsel
 will  be appointed if he or she is financially unable to retain counsel,
 and a returnable form shall be enclosed in the court's notice to the sex
 offender on which the sex offender may apply for assignment of  counsel.
 If  the  sex  offender  applies  for assignment of counsel and the court
 finds that the offender is financially unable  to  retain  counsel,  the
 court  shall  assign  counsel  to represent the sex offender pursuant to
 article eighteen-B of the county law. If the district attorney  seeks  a
 determination  that  differs  from  the  recommendation submitted by the
 board, at least ten days  prior  to  the  determination  proceeding  the
 district  attorney  shall  provide  to  the court and the sex offender a
 statement setting forth the determinations sought by the district attor-
 ney together with the reasons for seeking such determinations. The court
 shall allow the sex offender to appear and be  heard.  The  state  shall
 appear  by the district attorney, or his or her designee, who shall bear
 the burden of proving the facts supporting the determinations sought  by
 clear  and  convincing  evidence.  Where  there is a dispute between the
 parties concerning the determinations, the court shall adjourn the hear-
 ing as necessary to permit the sex offender or the district attorney  to
 obtain  materials relevant to the determinations from the state board of
 examiners of sex offenders or any state  or  local  facility,  hospital,
 institution, office, agency, department or division.  Such materials may
 be  obtained  by  subpoena if not voluntarily provided to the requesting
 party. In making the determinations the court shall review any  victim's
 statement  and  any relevant materials and evidence submitted by the sex
 offender and the district attorney and the recommendation and any  mate-
 rials submitted by the board, and may consider reliable hearsay evidence
 submitted  by either party, provided that it is relevant to the determi-
 nations. Facts previously proven at trial or elicited  at  the  time  of
 entry  of  a  plea  of  guilty  shall be deemed established by clear and
 convincing evidence and shall not be relitigated. The court shall render
 an order setting forth its determinations and the findings of  fact  and
 conclusions  of  law  on  which the determinations are based, SUCH ORDER
 SHALL ALSO INCLUDE ANY CONDITIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE IMPOSED PURSU-
 ANT TO SECTION 65.10 OF THE PENAL LAW. A copy  of  the  order  shall  be

 party, the court shall seal any portion of  the  court  file  or  record
 which  contains material that is confidential under any state or federal
 S. 1887  7
 
 statute. Either party may appeal as of right from the order pursuant  to
 the  provisions of articles fifty-five, fifty-six and fifty-seven of the
 civil practice law and rules. Where counsel has been assigned to  repre-
 sent  the  sex  offender upon the ground that the sex offender is finan-
 cially unable to retain counsel,  that  assignment  shall  be  continued
 throughout  the  pendency  of the appeal, and the person may appeal as a
 poor person pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county law.

 include  guidelines  and  procedures  on  the placement of sex offenders
 designated as level two or level three  offenders  pursuant  to  article

 Such regulations shall provide instruction  on  certain  factors  to  be

 offender recidivism and increasing public safety; and

 the likelihood that such offenders will be transient.
