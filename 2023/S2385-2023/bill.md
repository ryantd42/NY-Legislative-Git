  requirements for voting machines and systems
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  7-104 of the election law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 28 to read as follows:
  28. THE BALLOT SHALL BE  MARKED  OR  PRINTED  ON  DURABLE  PAPER.  FOR
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "DURABLE PAPER" IS DEFINED AS PAPER CAPABLE OF
 WITHSTANDING  MULTIPLE  COUNTS  AND  RECOUNTS BY HAND OR MACHINE WITHOUT
 COMPROMISING THE FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOTS,  AND  CAPABLE  OF
 RETAINING  THE  INFORMATION MARKED OR PRINTED ON SUCH PAPER FOR THE FULL
 DURATION OF A RETENTION AND PRESERVATION PERIOD  SET  FORTH  IN  SECTION
 3-222 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 7-200 of the election law, as amended by
 chapter 181 of the laws of 2005, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  The  board  of  elections of the city of New York and other county
 boards of elections may adopt any  kind  of  voting  machine  or  system
 approved  by  the state board of elections, or the use of which has been
 specifically authorized by law; and thereupon  such  voting  machine  or
 system  may  be  used  at  any or all elections and shall be used at all
 general or special elections held by such boards in such city,  town  or
 village  and in every contested primary election in the city of New York
 and in every contested primary election outside the city of New York  in
 which  there are one thousand or more enrolled voters qualified to vote.
 [No more than two types of voting machines or systems may be used by any
 local board of elections at  a  single  election.]  Notwithstanding  the
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 other  provisions  of this subdivision, any local board of elections may
 borrow or lease for use on an experimental basis for  a  period  of  not
 more than one year each, voting machines or systems of any type approved
 by the state board of elections.
  §  3. Paragraphs b, e, j, s and t of subdivision 1 of section 7-202 of
 the election law, as added by chapter 181  of  the  laws  of  2005,  are
 amended  and  three  new  paragraphs  u,  v  and  w are added to read as
 follows:
  b. permit a voter to vote for any person for any  office,  whether  or
 not  nominated  as a candidate by any party or independent body [without
 the ballot, or any part thereof, being removed from the machine  at  any
 time];
  e.  provide  the  voter  an opportunity to privately and independently
 MARK AND verify votes selected [and the] ON AN INDIVIDUAL, VOTER-VERIFI-
 ABLE PAPER BALLOT AND THE ability to privately and independently  change
 such  votes  or correct any error before the ballot is cast and counted,
 INCLUDING BY OFFERING THE VOTER A NEW PAPER BALLOT AS MANY TIMES  AS  IS
 ALLOWED  BY STATUTE OR REGULATION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION,
 THE TERM "INDIVIDUAL, VOTER-VERIFIABLE PAPER BALLOT" MEANS EITHER: (I) A
 PAPER BALLOT MARKED BY THE VOTER BY HAND; OR (II) A PAPER BALLOT  MARKED
 THROUGH  THE USE OF A NONTABULATING BALLOT MARKING DEVICE OR SYSTEM. FOR
 THE PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE, A "BALLOT MARKING DEVICE" IS A  DEVICE  THAT
 PROVIDES VOTERS, INCLUDING VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES, THE ABILITY TO MARK
 VOTES  ON  PHYSICAL,  PAPER BALLOTS PRIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY. FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE, A "NONTABULATING BALLOT  MARKING  DEVICE"  IS  A
 BALLOT MARKING DEVICE THAT DOES NOT TABULATE OR TRANSMIT VOTES OR RETAIN
 ANY  RECORD  OF  A  VOTER'S  SELECTIONS,  OTHER  THAN THE ORIGINAL PAPER
 BALLOT, AFTER THE VOTER HAS FINISHED MARKING THE PAPER BALLOT AND  USING
 THE DEVICE TO REVIEW SELECTIONS;
  j.  [retain all paper ballots cast or produce and retain a voter veri-
 fied permanent paper record which shall be presented to the  voter  from
 behind  a  window or other device before the ballot is cast,] FOR BALLOT
 SCANNERS, RETAIN PAPER BALLOTS IN A  MANNER  INTENDED  AND  DESIGNED  TO
 PROTECT  THE  PRIVACY  OF  THE  VOTER;  FOR NONTABULATING BALLOT MARKING
 DEVICES, PRODUCE OR PROCESS PAPER  BALLOTS  in  a  manner  intended  and
 designed  to  protect the privacy of the voter; such ballots [or record]
 shall allow a manual audit and shall be preserved in accordance with the
 provisions of section 3-222 of this chapter;
  s. permit alternative language accessibility pursuant to the  require-
 ments  of  section  203  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C.
 1973aa-1a) such that it must have  the  capacity  to  display  the  full
 ballot  in  the  alternative  languages  required  by the federal Voting
 Rights Act if such voting machine or system is to  be  used  where  such
 alternative  languages  are required or where the local board deems such
 feature necessary; [and]
  t. not include any device  or  functionality  potentially  capable  of
 externally  transmitting or receiving data via the internet or via radio
 waves or via other wireless means[.];
  U. BE CONSTRUCTED SO THAT, AFTER THE  PAPER  BALLOT  IS  CAST  BY  THE
 VOTER, THE VOTING MACHINE OR SYSTEM NEVER PASSES THE CAST BALLOT UNDER A
 PRINTER  THAT  CAN PRINT VOTES ONTO THE BALLOT, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF
 UNAUTHORIZED, MALICIOUS OR FAULTY SOFTWARE OR FIRMWARE;
  V. BE CONSTRUCTED SO THE CONFIGURATION OR FUNCTIONALITY  OF  A  VOTING
 MACHINE  OR  SYSTEM  DOES  NOT INCLUDE, WITHIN THE SAME PHYSICAL DEVICE,
 BOTH (I) BALLOT MARKING AND (II) TABULATING OR  TRANSMITTING  A  VOTER'S
 SELECTIONS  AT ANY TIME OR RETAINING ANY RECORD OF A VOTER'S SELECTIONS,
 S. 2385  3
 
 OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL PAPER BALLOT, AFTER THE VOTER HAS FINISHED MARK-
 ING THE PAPER BALLOT AND USING THE DEVICE TO REVIEW SELECTIONS; AND
  W.  NOT ENCODE VOTES ON A BALLOT, WHETHER AS A BARCODE, QR CODE OR ANY
 KIND OF RECORDING CODE THAT CANNOT BE  VERIFIED  BY  THE  VOTER  WITHOUT
 USING A CODE-READING DEVICE. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, A "CODE
 READING  DEVICE"  IS A DEVICE THAT READS AND TRANSLATES CODED MARKS LIKE
 QR CODES OR BARCODES INTO LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE  UNDERSTOOD  WITHOUT  ANY
 KIND OF DEVICE.
  §  4.  Subdivision 4 of section 7-202 of the election law, as added by
 chapter 181 of the laws of 2005, is amended and a new subdivision  5  is
 added to read as follows:
  4.  Local boards of elections which obtain voting machines pursuant to
 this chapter [may determine to] SHALL purchase [direct  recording  elec-
 tronic  machines  or optical scan machines] BALLOT SCANNERS AND NONTABU-
 LATING BALLOT MARKING DEVICES in conformance with  the  requirements  of
 this chapter.
  5.  LOCAL BOARDS OF ELECTIONS MUST PROVIDE EVERY VOTER, AT EVERY POLL-
 ING PLACE, BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:  (A)  TO  HAND  MARK  A  PAPER
 BALLOT; OR (B) TO USE A NONTABULATING BALLOT MARKING DEVICE OR SYSTEM TO
 MARK  A  PAPER BALLOT. ALL PAPER BALLOTS MUST BE PRINTED, SCANNABLE, AND
 INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT CONTESTS AND CANDIDATES.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 any  local  board of elections that purchased voting machines or systems
 prior to such date which are not in compliance with the requirements  of
 paragraph  u or v of subdivision 1 and subdivision 4 of section 7-202 of
 the election law, may continue to use, maintain and replace such  voting
 machines  and  systems,  but  may replace them only with identical model
 voting machines or systems made by the same manufacturer,  or  identical
 model  voting machines or systems with de minimis changes in such voting
 machines' or systems' hardware, software,  technical  data  package,  or
 data, the nature of which will not materially alter the voting machines'
 or systems' reliability, functionality, capability, or operation; any de
 minimis changes shall be approved by the state board of elections.
