students nationwide, since its launch; and
 
  WHEREAS, PCFSN also continues its  work  with  schools  through  the
Presidential  Youth  Fitness  Program  which  supports  quality physical

environment,  Let's Move! Cities, Towns and Counties (LMCTC) has engaged
more than 400 cities to transform their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, The creation of safe  routes  to  schools,  maintenance  of

therefore, be it
