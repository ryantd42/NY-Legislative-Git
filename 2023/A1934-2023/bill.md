 AN ACT directing the metropolitan transportation authority to study  the
  feasibility  of  co-mingling public transit and freight service on the
  proposed Triboro line along the rail right-of-way running  from  Co-op
  City  in  the  Bronx,  through  Queens,  and terminating in Bay Ridge,
  Brooklyn
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  1.  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority shall, in
 consultation with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and  the
 state  Department  of Transportation, conduct a study to explore the use
 of the Triboro rail line as a  co-mingled  public  transit  and  freight
 line,  exploring  the  reduction  of  travel  time  for residents and an
 increase in quality of life for outer borough residents.
  2. The study shall  cover  the  full  extent  of  the  corridor  which
 includes  Amtrak's  ownership  in  the  Bronx  south  over the Hell Gate
 bridge, CSX's Fremont Secondary line south to Fresh Pond  Junction,  and
 the  Long  Island  Rail Road's Bay Ridge branch operated by New York and
 Atlantic Railway.
  3. Such study shall examine the challenges, opportunities, and  feasi-
 bility  of  co-mingling  public  transit  and  freight service along the
 Triboro rail line.
  4. Within one year of the effective date of this act, the Metropolitan
 Transportation Authority shall issue a report of  its  findings  on  the
 feasibility  and  benefits  of  co-mingling  public  transit and freight
 service along the Triboro rail line to the governor, the temporary pres-
 ident of the senate and the speaker of the assembly of the state of  New
 York.  Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (a)  the  populations  served  and  ridership expected to benefit from

  (b) the potential  transit  travel  time  reductions,  greenhouse  gas
 reductions,  and  economic  benefits  expected  from  the public transit
 service on the Triboro rail line;
  (c) the locations of potential stations, frequency and span of service
 expected to run daily along the Triboro rail line;
  (d) the operational segments (in phases) to get service started; sche-
 dules  needed  for  co-mingling with freight; expected freight expansion
 and impacts to service; and
  (e) any actions that can be implemented by the Metropolitan  Transpor-
 tation  Authority immediately, a plan of action for such implementation,
 and the estimated cost of such implementation plan.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
