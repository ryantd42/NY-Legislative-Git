 Introduced  by M. of A. DURSO -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Correction
 
 AN ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to  authorizing  munici-
  palities to establish residency restrictions for sex offenders
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative findings. It is the sense  of  the  legislature
 that  determinations  regarding  restrictions  upon the residence of sex
 offenders who are required to register pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 article  6-C  of  the correction law should be made by the local munici-
 pality in which such offenders reside  since  municipalities  are  in  a
 better  position  than  the state, after taking into consideration local
 conditions and after determining what  entities  with  vulnerable  popu-
 lations  would require protection from registered sex offenders, to make
 such determinations.
  § 2. Section 168-w of the correction law, as renumbered by chapter 604
 of the laws of 2005, is renumbered section 168-x and a new section 168-w
 is added to read as follows:
  § 168-W. MUNICIPAL RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS.  ANY MUNICIPALITY MAY ENACT
 A LOCAL LAW WHICH IMPOSES  RESIDENCY  RESTRICTIONS  UPON  SEX  OFFENDERS
 REQUIRED  TO REGISTER PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH RESI-
 DENCY RESTRICTIONS ARE NO LESS RESTRICTIVE  THAN  THE  REQUIREMENTS  SET
 FORTH  IN  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF SUBDIVISION FOUR-A OF SECTION 65.10 OF THE
 PENAL LAW AND SUBDIVISION FOURTEEN OF SECTION TWO  HUNDRED  FIFTY-NINE-C
 OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
