 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to  the  right  to
  contract  for  the  burial of cremains in pet cemeteries and requiring
  notice related thereto

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general business law is amended by adding a new section
 750-vv to read as follows:
  §  750-VV. BURIAL OF CREMAINS; NOTICE REQUIRED. 1. PET CEMETERY OWNERS
 AND OPERATORS WHO ALLOW FOR THE BURIAL OF  HUMAN  CREMATED  REMAINS,  AS
 DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  SECTION  FORTY-TWO HUNDRED TWO OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, OF PET OWNERS WITH THEIR  PETS  MAY,  PURSUANT  TO  A
 WRITTEN CONTRACT, CHARGE A REASONABLE FEE FOR SUCH BURIAL.
  2.  SUCH OWNERS AND OPERATORS SHALL PROVIDE A WRITTEN NOTICE TO ANYONE
 SEEKING TO BURY A PET OWNER'S CREMATED REMAINS WITH THE PET OWNER'S  PET
 BEFORE  ANY CONTRACT IS SIGNED OR CONSIDERATION IS PAID FOR SUCH BURIAL.
 SAID NOTICE SHALL BE IN FOURTEEN POINT BOLD TYPE AND STATE  THE  FOLLOW-
 ING:
  "THIS  IS A PET CEMETERY UNDER THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW (ARTICLE 35-C)
 NOT A PUBLIC CEMETERY UNDER THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION LAW  (ARTICLE
 15).  WHILE HUMAN CREMATED REMAINS MAY BE BURIED IN A PET CEMETERY, SUCH
 CREMATED REMAINS ARE NOT COVERED BY ANY OF THE PROTECTIONS  PROVIDED  TO
 HUMAN CREMAINS UNDER THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION LAW."
  3.  SUCH  OWNERS  AND OPERATORS SHALL ALSO INCLUDE IN ANY CONTRACT FOR
 BURIAL OF CREMATED REMAINS OF A PET OWNER THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE:
 "YOUR RIGHTS AND THOSE OF YOUR FAMILY AND DESCENDANTS ARE SET  FORTH  IN
 THIS  CONTRACT.  THIS  IS  A PET CEMETERY UNDER THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW
 (ARTICLE 35-C) NOT A PUBLIC CEMETERY  UNDER  THE  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  CORPO-
 RATION LAW (ARTICLE 15). WHILE HUMAN CREMATED REMAINS MAY BE BURIED IN A
 PET  CEMETERY,  NEW YORK STATE LAW PROVIDES NO ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS OR
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 MEMORIALS,  AND  CREMATED  REMAINS  DISPOSED OF ON THIS PROPERTY WILL BE
 MAINTAINED OR PRESERVED; ENSURE THAT THIS  PROPERTY'S  CURRENT  USE  AND
 CONDITION  WILL  BE MAINTAINED; OR ENSURE THAT THIS PROPERTY WILL NOT BE
