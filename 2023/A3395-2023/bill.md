 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  requirements  for
  collective  negotiations  by health care providers with certain health
  benefit plans in certain counties, and providing  for  the  repeal  of
  such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Statement of legislative intent. The legislature finds that
 collective negotiation by competing health care providers for the  terms
 and  conditions  of contracts with health plans can result in beneficial
 results  for  health  care  consumers.  The  legislature  further  finds
 instances  where  health plans dominate the market to such a degree that
 fair and adequate negotiations between health  care  providers  and  the
 plans are adversely affected, so that it is necessary and appropriate to
 provide for a demonstration to examine the risks and benefits associated
 with  a  system of collective action on behalf of health care providers.
 Consequently, the legislature finds it appropriate and necessary in  the
 demonstration  service  area  to displace competition with regulation of
 health plan-provider agreements and authorize collective negotiations on
 the terms and conditions of the relationship between health  care  plans
 and  health  care  providers  so the imbalances between the two will not
 result in adverse conditions of health care. This act is not intended to
 apply to or affect in any respect  collective  bargaining  relationships
 involving health care providers as defined in section 4920 of the public
 health  law  or  rights  relating to collective bargaining arising under
 applicable federal or state collective bargaining statutes.
  § 2. Short title.  This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as  the
 "health care consumer and provider protection act".
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
