  COMMEMORATING  the  300th  Anniversary  of  Dygert
  Farms in Palatine Bridge, New York
 
  WHEREAS, The agricultural industry is part of  the  foundation  upon
which  our  distinct  American heritage is built; New York State and the
entire United States are dependent on our agricultural  industry  for  a
variety of food products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
milestones of those farms which substantially contribute to the economic
vitality of their communities and the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 300th Anniversary of Dygert Farms  in  Palatine  Bridge,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  original  deed  to the 50-acre plot upon which Dygert
Farms is built, was granted  by  the  Queen  of  England  in  1723;  the
original house and several dairy barns still stand on the property; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its inception, Dygert Farms has supplied Montgomery
County and the Capital Region with an assortment of fine dairy products,
including whole, reduced, and skim milks, mocha cold brew, half &  half,
and eggnog; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the farm milks 230 cows and consists of 450 tillable
and 75 non-tillable acres; the Dygert Farms also has a breathtaking view
that overlooks the beautiful Mohawk Valley; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dygert Farms, which has been a dairy focused farm since its
inception,  has  experienced  loss  in  the  form of numerous fires, but
historically always bounced back in a true testament to resiliency; and
 
  WHEREAS, While remaining true to its roots as a working farm, Dygert
Farms has also embraced the future in providing a  destination  for  all
age groups; generations of families have been welcomed to the farm since
its doors opened a century ago; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The hardworking Robby and Shannon, owners and operators of
Dygert Farms, are active in their  community,  donating  milk  to  their
local  food  pantries  each week, as well as hosting children from local
schools to come tour their facilities and learn about  food  production;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robby  oversees three full-time employees and plays a role
in the dairy itself, including milking, feeding, and  calving;  he  also
serves  in  the processing plant as the Plant Processing Superintendent;
Shannon helps where needed, but  primarily  focuses  on  creamery  order
management and social media; and
 
  WHEREAS, With four young children, the owners started the processing
plant  to  provide  opportunities  for  the  12th  generation  of  the
family-owned business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Distinguishing  themselves in achieving Tricentennial Farm
status  by  the  New  York  State  Agricultural  Society,  Dygert  Farms
continues  to  expand  and  adapt with the times, and is poised for many
years of sparkling success to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
applaud  the  leaders  of  commerce  and  industry whose accomplishments
contribute to the economic health and prosperity of the  communities  of
the State of New York and to the quality of life of its people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges the success of this exceptional farm and its  contributions
to  the local and State economies, fully confident that it will continue
to enjoy the sparkling successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 300th Anniversary of Dygert Farms  in  Palatine  Bridge,
New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Dygert Farms.
