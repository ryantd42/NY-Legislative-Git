 early education programs provide a substantial economic payoff to commu-
 nities  where  they  are  located.  The  legislature declares that it is
 crucial for the governor and legislators to obtain  reliable,  objective
 information  about  the  economic  benefits  and burdens of investing in
 expanded childcare and early education programs within the state.
  The purpose of this act is to study the economic impact on  the  state
 economy  of  quality childcare and early education programs for children
 aged 0-4, and after-school programs for children aged 5-12.
  § 3. The economic development law is amended by adding a  new  article
 23 to read as follows:
