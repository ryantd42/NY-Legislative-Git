of National School Nurse Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1972, National School Nurse Day has been set aside to
recognize school nurses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  School  Nurse  Day  was  established to foster a

  WHEREAS, Families deserve to feel confident that their children will
be cared for when they are at school; and
 
  WHEREAS, All students have a right to have their physical and mental

health problems requiring care in school; and
 
  WHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic has  emphasized  the  essential  role
school nurses play in student health and academic success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  nurses  have  served  a critical role in improving
public health and in ensuring students' academic success for  more  than
100 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, School nurses address the home and community factors (e.g.,
social determinants) that impact students' health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  nurses  act  as a liaison to the school community,

children; and

children and youth by providing access to care when children's cognitive
development is at its peak; and
 
  WHEREAS, School nurses are members of  school-based  teams  such  as
school  health  services,  504/  IEP, and disaster/emergency planning to
address the school population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  nurses  understand  the  link  between  health and
learning and are able to make a positive difference for  children  every
day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative Body to join the
National Association of School Nurses in celebrating  and  acknowledging
the  accomplishments  of  school  nurses everywhere and their efforts of
meeting the needs of today's  students  by  improving  the  delivery  of
health care in our schools, and offering gratitude for school nurses who
contribute to our local communities by helping students stay healthy, in
school,  and  ready to learn, and keeping parents and guardians at work,
not just on School Nurse Day, but at every  opportunity  throughout  the
year; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 11,  2023,  as  School
Nurse Day in the State of New York; and be it further
