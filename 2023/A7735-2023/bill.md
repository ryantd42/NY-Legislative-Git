  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in relation  to  eligibility  for
  certain  employees of certain affiliates of the metropolitan transpor-
  tation authority for health benefits

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative determination. The legislature has determined
 that the metropolitan transportation authority (MTA) and certain  affil-
 iates have institutional hurdles in staffing certain low level manageri-
 al  positions due to the fact that there is little incentive for employ-
 ees to apply for or to accept promotion to such positions. In  accepting
 such  promotions,  the  employee  often  receives  significantly reduced
 compensation in terms of  both  salaries  and  benefits.  Of  particular
 concern  is  the  cost of the health plan for employees in the titles of
 deputy superintendent, superintendent, assistant general  superintendent
 or  group  station  superintendent.  The  health plan available to these
 employees is markedly inferior to those of their subordinates yet  these
 employees  pay  vastly  higher out of pocket expenses and contributions.
 The ability of the MTA  to  fill  these  positions  is  crucial  to  the
 provision  of  transit services, both by rail and by bus, in the city of
 New York as these titles are responsible for  coordinating  services  to
 the  public  and  correcting  a  wide range of service interruptions and
 staffing matters.  The legislature further finds  that  employment  with
 the  affected MTA affiliates is so unique in the transportation industry
 that promotion from within is vastly superior  to  hiring  from  outside
 sources  and  incentives for employees in the supervisory ranks to apply
 for and accept  managerial  positions  is,  consequently,  of  paramount
 importance  to  the  provision of safe, reliable transit services to the
 citizens of this state. For these reasons, the legislature  has  adopted
 the following amendment to the New York civil service law.
