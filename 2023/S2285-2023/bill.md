 AN ACT to direct the empire state development corporation to  conduct  a
  study on the feasibility of a minority and women-owned business enter-
  prise capacity mentorship program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. 1. The empire state development corporation shall conduct a
 study to explore the feasibility of a minority and women-owned  business
 enterprise  capacity mentorship program. The study should focus on which
 agencies and industries would benefit most from such program, the utili-
 zation of any existing  minority  and  women-owned  business  enterprise
 mentorship  programs,  and  any  fiscal  implications.  The  study shall
 specifically focus on:
  a. which state agencies would benefit most from such  program  concen-
 trating in construction;
  b.  which  state agencies would benefit most from such program concen-
 trating in professional services;
  c. which state agencies would benefit most from such  program  concen-
 trating in non-professional services;
  d.  which  state agencies would benefit most from such program concen-
 trating in purchases of commodities;
  e. the duration of time minority and women-owned business  enterprises
 should participate in each program concentration described in paragraphs
 a through d of this subdivision;
  f.  the  feasibility  that  such successful completion of such program
 could be used as a factor for prequalifying participating  minority  and
 women-owned business enterprises; and
  g.  how  such  program  can be tailored to better prepare minority and
 women-owned business enterprises for  bidding  on  contracts  with  such
 agencies upon successful completion of the program.
