BY: M. of A. Bronson
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  40th  Anniversary  of  the
  Rochester Gay Men's Chorus' first performance on May
  7, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  those musical organizations that have brought entertainment and
cultural enrichment to the citizens of the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of  the  Rochester  Gay  Men's  Chorus'
first performance to be celebrated on Sunday, May 7, 2023, at the Inn on
Broadway, Rochester, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  November  of  1982,  five  friends,  David  Knoll, Bob
Olsowki, Kent Peterson, Ken Setera, and Nicholas Williams,  created  the
Rochester Gay Men's Chorus to pursue a dream of using music to create an
acceptance of social diversity and to use the harmony of voice to create
a harmony of the spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On the 18th of that month, the first rehearsal was held in
Kent Peterson's living room, and six months later, on Saturday,  May  7,
1983,  the  Rochester  Gay  Men's  Chorus performed their first concert,
entitled Rochester Gay Men's Chorus in Concert, at  Calvary  Street  St.
Andrews Church; and
 
  WHEREAS, By then, the Chorus consisted of 18 singers; in addition to
the original five members, they were joined by Lavern Doud, Steven Getz,
Michael Holden, Steven Jarose, Chuck Kruppenbacher, David Merrill , Bill
Metz,  Pat  Moran,  Greg  Partridge, John Rutkowksi, David Skinner, John
Strawway, Chuck Telier, and Del Titus; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the  last  four  decades,  the  members  of  the
Rochester Gay Men's Chorus have continuously sung for themselves to make
glorious  music  with  friends who experience the world as we do and who
share our joy in standing together; have  sung  for  their  sisters  and
brothers  in  the  gay,  lesbian,  bisexual and transgender community to
embody pride, family, and a sense of home; have sung for  their  friends
and supporters who join with us to overcome ignorance and prejudice; and
have  sung  for  those unknown and unseen, awakening to who they are, in
closets of oppression, or in search of community, that they may see  our
faces  and hear our joy and know that the night is not forever, and that
there are friends and brothers to light their way and  to  welcome  them
home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  four  decades  of  success, the Rochester Gay Men's
Chorus will celebrate their legacy and future in  the  LGBTQ  community,
the City of Rochester, State of New York, Nation, and World; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  arts, in whatever form depicted, are central to human
expression; they are truly a universal language and  their  contribution
to  the  development  of  friendship and understanding among all peoples
cannot be overestimated; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  history, the heritage, and the lives of the people of
all backgrounds and all cultures are portrayed in their music;  the  art
and act of sharing them enriches us altogether; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  practice  of  this Legislative Body that when
musical societies of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought  to
our  attention,  they  should  be recognized by all the citizens of this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  40th  Anniversary  of  the Rochester Gay Men's Chorus'
first performance on May 7, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Rochester Gay Men's Chorus.
