  3. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL NOTIFY THE BOARD  OF  EDUCATION  AND  COUNTY
 BOARD OF ELECTIONS OF SUCH DATE.  THE CLERK OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL
 PUBLISH NOTICE OF THE DATE OF THE ADDITIONAL DAY OF VOTING NOT LESS THAN
 TWICE IN EACH WEEK PRECEDING THE DATE FOR THE ADDITIONAL DAY FOR VOTING,
 IN  TWO  NEWSPAPERS  HAVING  GENERAL CIRCULATION WITHIN SUCH DISTRICT IF
