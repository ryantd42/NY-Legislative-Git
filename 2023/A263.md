  Bells; mail receptacles; PACKAGES.
  3.  (A)  IN  CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, WHENEVER
 THE OWNER OF A MULTIPLE DWELLING HAS NOT ARRANGED  FOR  PACKAGES  TO  BE
 DELIVERED  TO OCCUPANTS THEREOF BY HIMSELF, HERSELF, HIS OR HER AGENT OR
 EMPLOYEES, SUCH OWNER SHALL DESIGNATE A SECURE SPACE WITHIN THE BUILDING

 MANAGEMENT OFFICE, CLOSET, OR OTHER SIMILARLY DESIGNATED SPACE, AND SUCH
 SPACE SHALL BE:

 DOORWAYS OF THE RESIDENTS TO WHICH THEY ARE ADDRESSED.
  (C)  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL RESULT IN THE OWNER
