  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 10, 2023, as NET Cancer Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 10, 2023, as  NET
Cancer Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, On November 10, 2023, NET Cancer Day increases awareness of
neuroendocrine (NET) cancers and genetic neuroendocrine tumors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Neuroendocrine cells exist throughout the body and produce
hormones to ensure our bodies function properly; neuroendocrine  cancers
occur  when  these  cells  start  to  change  shape  and  begin  to grow
abnormally; and
 
  WHEREAS, 58% of patients have advanced stage NET cancer by the  time
they are properly diagnosed as misdiagnosis happens frequently; there is
currently  no  cure  for the majority of patients, so it is paramount we
raise awareness of NET cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS, We strive to live in a world where all  patients  with  NET
cancer  receive  a  timely diagnosis, premium treatment, support, and in
the future, a cure; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be a greater awareness of  this
serious  health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 10, 2023, as NET
Cancer Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
