  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  MAKE  WHATEVER  PROVISIONS  ARE FEASIBLE AND
 DESIRABLE  TO  MAINTAIN  AND  ISSUE  ALL  SUITABLE  DOCUMENTS  REGARDING
 ADVANCED  DIRECTIVES AT DRIVER'S LICENSE EXAMINING OFFICES. IN ADDITION,
 AN APPLICANT FOR A  COMMERCIAL  DRIVER'S  LICENSE  WHO  WILL  OPERATE  A

 HUNDRED TEN-A, AND FIVE HUNDRED TEN-AA OF THIS TITLE, THE TERMS "MEDICAL

 A. 771  4
 
 gration status. The commissioner may also provide that  the  application
 procedure  shall  include  the  taking of a photo image or images of the
 applicant in accordance with rules and  regulations  prescribed  by  the
 commissioner.  In addition, the commissioner also shall require that the
 applicant provide his or her social security number where such applicant
 is a legal immigrant and [shall] provide space  on  the  application  so
 that  the  applicant may register in the New York state organ and tissue
 donor registry under section  forty-three  hundred  ten  of  the  public
 health  law  [with  the following stated on the application in clear and
 conspicuous type:
  "You must fill out the following section: Would you like to  be  added
 to  the  Donate  Life  Registry? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this ques-
 tion'."
  The commissioner of  the  department  of  health  shall  not  maintain
 records  of any person who checks "skip this question". Failure to check
 a box shall not impair the validity of an application,  and  failure  to
 check  "yes"  or checking "skip this question" shall not be construed to
 imply a wish not to donate. In the case of an applicant  under  eighteen
 years  of  age,  checking  "yes" shall not constitute consent to make an
 anatomical gift or registration in the donate life  registry.  Where  an
 applicant  has previously consented to make an anatomical gift or regis-
 tered in the donate life registry,  checking  "skip  this  question"  or
 failing  to  check a box shall not impair that consent or registration].
 In addition, the commissioner also shall require  that  space  shall  be
 provided on the application so that the applicant may request a notation
 upon such license that he or she is a veteran of the United States armed
 forces.  Additionally,  the  commissioner  shall  ensure that space is
 provided on the application so  that  the  applicant  shall  indicate  a
 declaration  relating to the designation of a health care proxy pursuant
 to section twenty-nine hundred eighty-one of the public health  law  and

  "You  must fill out the following section: Have you completed a health
 care proxy? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this question'." Followed by  a
 space for the health care agent's name.
  The  commissioner  shall  also  ensure  that  space is provided on the
 application so that the applicant shall indicate a declaration  relating
 to  the use of life-sustaining treatment and that the following is typed
 in clear and conspicuous type:

 will? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this question'."
  The  commissioner  shall  make  whatever  provisions  are feasible and
 desirable  to  maintain  and  issue  all  suitable  documents  regarding
 advanced  directives at driver's license examining offices. In addition,
 an applicant for a  commercial  driver's  license  who  will  operate  a
 commercial motor vehicle in interstate  commerce shall certify that such
 applicant  meets the requirements to operate a commercial motor vehicle,
 as set forth in public law 99-570, title XII, and title 49 of  the  code
 of  federal  regulations,  and all regulations promulgated by the United
 States secretary of transportation under the hazardous materials  trans-
 portation  act.  In  addition,  an  applicant  for a commercial driver's
 license shall submit a medical certificate at such intervals as required
 by the federal motor carrier safety improvement act  of  1999  and  Part
 383.71(h)  of  title  49  of the code of federal regulations relating to
 medical certification and in a manner prescribed  by  the  commissioner.
 For  purposes  of  this  section  and  sections five hundred three, five

 certificate" and "medical certification" shall mean a form substantially
 in compliance with the form set forth in Part 391.43(h) of title  49  of
 the code of federal regulations. Upon a determination that the holder of

 to  the application for such license, the commissioner shall revoke such
 license.
  § 5. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 504 of the vehicle  and
 traffic  law,  as separately amended by chapters 568 and 639 of the laws
 of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  (a) Every license or renewal thereof shall  contain  a  distinguishing
 mark  and  adequate  space  upon  which  an anatomical gift, pursuant to
 section forty-three hundred ten of the public health law, by the  licen-
 see shall be recorded and shall contain such other information and shall
 be  issued  in  such form as the commissioner shall determine; provided,
 however, every license or renewal thereof issued to a person  under  the
 age  of  twenty-one  years  shall have prominently imprinted upon it the
 statement "UNDER 21 YEARS  OF  AGE"  in  notably  distinctive  print  or
 format;  provided  further,  however,  every  license or renewal thereof
 issued to a person making an  anatomical  gift  shall  have  prominently
 printed  upon the front of such license or renewal thereof the statement

 of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, takes effect; provided, however, that
 section three of this act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth
 day  after  it  shall  have  become  a  law; and provided, further, that
 section four of this act shall take effect October 3, 2026.
