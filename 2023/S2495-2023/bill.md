  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 declares  that  many  New Yorkers face the difficulty of living within a
 child care desert. New York State has begun the process of remedying the
 issue of the lack of child care through the creation of the  child  care
 availability  taskforce.  The  legislature  has an obligation to include
 under their jurisdiction an evaluation of regulations regarding staffing
 ratios set forth by the office of children and family services.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 390-k of the  social  services  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  133  of  the  laws  of 2022, is amended to read as
 follows:
  3. The taskforce shall:
  (a) examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child care  in  New
 York state;
  (b) advise the state in developing an implementation framework leading
 to  a phased-in rollout of universal child care using existing state and
 federal resources;
  (c) recommend potential solutions,  partnerships,  or  other  ways  to
 address  chronic  child care workforce issues and other concerns identi-
 fied in the course of the examination required by this subdivision;
  (d) assess the implementation of policies supported by federally fund-
 ed programs through various stimulus packages; [and]

 ments to section 390-k of the social services law made by section two of

 repealed therewith.
