 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  directing  the commissioner of health and the
  commissioner of the office for people with developmental  disabilities
  to  conduct  a  study  of the delivery of services to individuals with
  traumatic brain injury

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature recognizes that a trau-
 matic  brain  injury  results from a sudden blow or jolt to the head and
 can present in individuals with a wide range of mild, moderate or severe
 symptoms. Each traumatic brain injury case is unique and complex,  often
 requiring  supports  and  services  to  allow individuals to achieve the
 highest quality of life. This legislation will direct  a  study  on  the
 delivery of services to New Yorkers with traumatic brain injury. Specif-
 ically,  the  study  will evaluate the availability and accessibility of
 quality services, emerging trends, regional disparities, and the  effec-
 tiveness  of  the  administrative process for individuals with traumatic
 brain injury who receive official  approvals  or  denials  of  services.
 Furthermore,  the  commissioner  of  health  and the commissioner of the
 office  for  people  with  developmental  disabilities  should  make
 suggestions  to  enhance  New  York  state's response to traumatic brain
 injuries based on the findings of this study.
  § 2. a. The commissioner of health and the commissioner of the  office
 for  people with developmental disabilities shall conduct a study on the
 delivery of services provided to individuals  diagnosed  with  traumatic
 brain  injury.  Such  services to be studied  shall include, but not be
 limited to acute and sub-acute rehabilitation, counseling and behavioral
 services, home care services, independent living skills training,  envi-
 ronmental  modifications,  housing  opportunities,  and  any services or
 programs specific to traumatic brain injury or  that  serve  individuals

 with traumatic brain injury.  In conducting the study, the commissioners
 shall  consult  with  people with traumatic brain injury and their fami-
 lies, organizations representing such people, and  providers  of  health
 care and other services to people with traumatic brain injury.
  b.  The  study  shall  examine  the  availability and accessibility of
 services for individuals diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, the cost
 of receiving such services, and any disparities that may  exist  in  the
 regional availability of services.
  c. The study shall identify emerging trends in traumatic brain injury,
 including  changes  in  incidences,  changes in the needs of individuals
 with traumatic brain injury, and assess the training  service  providers
 receive relating to traumatic brain injury.
  d. The study shall also examine the difference in services availabili-
 ty  and  outcomes  for  individuals that may be enrolled in any Medicaid
 waiver.
  e. The study shall examine the efficiency of the administrative  proc-
 esses  that  provide  individuals  with  traumatic brain injury official
 approvals or denials of service.
  f. The commissioner of health and the commissioner of the  office  for
 people  with  developmental  disabilities  shall make recommendations to
 improve the delivery, quality, accessibility, and cost of the full range
 of services available to individuals with traumatic brain injury.
  g. The commissioner of health and the commissioner of the  office  for
 people  with  developmental disabilities shall report and publish on the
 department of health's website, and transmit such  commissioners'  find-
 ings  and  recommendations to the governor, the speaker of the assembly,
 the minority leader of the assembly,  the  temporary  president  of  the
 senate  and the minority leader of the senate on or before one year from
 the date this act shall take effect.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
