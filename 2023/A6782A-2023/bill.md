  1. Each community college, except in the city of New  York,  shall  be

 agency, four, from among persons residing in the  sponsoring  community,
 by the governor and one member elected by and from among the students of
 the  college  who  shall  serve  as a member of the board for a one-year

 law, ordinance, charter,  code,  rule  or  regulation  applying  to  the
 members  of  such  board  with  respect to the discharge of their duties
 including, but not limited to, those provisions setting forth  codes  of
 ethics,  disclosure  requirements  and  prohibiting business and profes-
 sional activities. The election of the student member shall be conducted
 in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by  the  respective
 representative  campus student association in accordance with guidelines
 established by the state university trustees.  In  the  event  that  the
 student  member  ceases  to  be  a student at the institution, [he] THEY
 shall be required to resign. The governor's initial  appointments  shall
 be for terms of two, four, six and eight years respectively and those by
 local  authorities  for  terms of one, three, five, seven and nine years
 respectively. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms in the  same
 manner  as  original  selections  by  the  authority responsible for the
 original selection. The board shall select its own chairman  from  among
 its  voting  membership.  Where  two  or more local sponsors join in the
 establishment of a community college, the apportionment of the  appoint-
 ments  among them shall be made by the state university trustees.  Trus-
 tees shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reim-
 bursed for their expenses actually and necessarily incurred by  them  in
 the  performance  of  their duties under this article. Members initially
 appointed or elected under this subdivision to the board of trustees  of
 any community college hereafter established shall take office immediate-
 ly upon their selection and qualification, but for purposes of determin-
 ing the expiration of their respective terms and the commencement of the
 terms  of  their  successors,  the  term  of office of each such initial
 member shall be deemed to have commenced on the first day of July of the
 year in which such college was established. The terms of office  of  all
 members  of  the  boards  of  trustees  of community colleges heretofore
 established, appointed or elected as provided in this subdivision, shall
 terminate on the thirtieth day of June of the calendar year within which
 such terms expire under the provisions of  this  subdivision  as  hereby
 amended.  For  the purpose of determining such year all initial terms of
 office of appointed members of  the  boards  of  trustees  of  community
 colleges heretofore established shall be deemed to have commenced on the
 first  day  of  July of the year in which such colleges were established
 and the terms of their successors for  full  terms,  if  any,  shall  be
 deemed to have commenced upon the expiration of the number of years from
 such date for which such initial appointments were made.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
