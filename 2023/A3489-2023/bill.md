  4.  When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the
 renewal of a license or a new license with reference to any activity  of
 a  continuing  nature,  the  existing  license does not expire until the
 application has been finally determined by the agency, and, in case  the
 application is denied or the terms of the new license limited, until the

 order  of  the reviewing court, provided that this subdivision shall not
 affect any valid agency action then in effect summarily suspending  such

 that  effect  in  its  order,  summary  suspension  of  a license may be
 ordered, effective on the date specified in such order or  upon  service
 of  a  certified  copy of such order on the licensee, whichever shall be
 later,  pending  proceedings  for  revocation  or  other  action.  These
 proceedings shall be promptly instituted and determined.

 disclosure of information or material otherwise protected  by  law  from
 disclosure,  including  information  and  material  protected because of
 privilege or confidentiality. If, after such disclosure, a party  deter-
 mines  to  rely upon other witnesses or information, the party shall, as
