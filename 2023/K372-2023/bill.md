  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 1, 2023, as School Principal's Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to highlight the men and women who lend
their passion and skills to educating our children; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1, 2023, as School Principal's Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
School Principal's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  Principal's  Day  was  created  to  recognize  the
essential role principals play in making a school great; and
 
  WHEREAS, Principals are among the hardest working, yet  often  least
recognized  individuals  in  education;  they  set the academic tone for
their schools, and it is their  vision,  dedication,  and  determination
that provide the mobilizing force for achieving student success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  Principal's Day seeks to honor these unsung heroes
for their tireless efforts in pursuit of excellence in education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital  day  is  a  widely  recognized
celebration  of  the  principalship,  marked  by  national  and  state
resolutions supporting the event, as well as acknowledgements from  U.S.
Senators and Representatives, and top government officials; however, the
most  important  National Principal's Day celebrations are the ones that
take place in schools and communities across the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Significant contributors to education in  New  York  State,
our  principals  continually  demonstrate  an  impressive dedication, an
unparalleled devotion and an unremitting enthusiasm for the  quality  of
the  educational programs and opportunities offered at their schools for
the benefit  of  faculty  and  students,  as  well  as  for  the  entire
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize the
educators of New York State who work to open the minds of their students
to new ideas, knowledge and dreams; who keep American democracy alive by
laying the foundation for good citizenship; who fill many roles such  as
listeners,  explorers,  role  models,  motivators  and  mentors; and who
continue to influence their students long after the school days are only
memories; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 1, 2023, as School
Principal's Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
