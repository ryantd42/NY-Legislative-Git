 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the price goug-
  ing of medicine

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general business law is amended by adding a new section
 396-rrr to read as follows:
  §  396-RRR.  PRICE  GOUGING  OF  MEDICINE. 1. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
 SECTION, "DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE" SHALL MEAN  ANY  DRUG  OR  MEDICAL
 PRODUCT  INTENDED  FOR HUMAN USE PUBLICLY REPORTED AS BEING SUBJECT TO A
 SHORTAGE BY THE U.S.  FOOD  AND  DRUG  ADMINISTRATION  ON  ITS  WEBSITE,
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, THAT A DRUG OR MEDICAL PRODUCT SHALL ONLY BE CONSID-
 ERED A "DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE" DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT  SUCH
 DRUG OR MEDICAL PRODUCT IS LISTED AS BEING SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE ON SUCH
 WEBSITE.
  2. NO MANUFACTURER, SUPPLIER, WHOLESALER, DISTRIBUTOR OR RETAIL SELLER
 OF  ANY  DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE SHALL SELL OR OFFER TO SELL ANY SUCH
 DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE FOR AN AMOUNT WHICH REPRESENTS AN UNCONSCION-
 ABLY EXCESSIVE PRICE.
  3. WHETHER A PRICE IS UNCONSCIONABLY EXCESSIVE IS A  QUESTION  OF  LAW
 FOR THE COURT.
  (A)  THE  COURT'S  DETERMINATION  THAT A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION HAS
 OCCURRED SHALL BE BASED ON ANY OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS:
  (I) THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE EXCESS IN PRICE IS UNCONSCIONABLY EXTREME;
  (II) THAT THERE WAS AN EXERCISE OF UNFAIR LEVERAGE  OR  UNCONSCIONABLE
 MEANS; OR
  (III)  A  COMBINATION OF BOTH FACTORS IN SUBPARAGRAPHS (I) AND (II) OF
 THIS PARAGRAPH.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 608  2
 
  (B) IN ANY PROCEEDING COMMENCED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOUR  OF  THIS
 SECTION, PRIMA FACIE PROOF THAT A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION HAS OCCURRED
 SHALL INCLUDE EVIDENCE THAT:
  (I)  THE AMOUNT CHARGED REPRESENTS A GROSS DISPARITY BETWEEN THE PRICE
 OF THE DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT  OF  THE  TRANS-
 ACTION AND THEIR VALUE MEASURED BY THE PRICE AT WHICH SUCH DRUG WAS SOLD
 OR  OFFERED  FOR  SALE  BY THE DEFENDANT IN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS
 IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE SHORTAGE; OR
  (II) THE AMOUNT CHARGED GROSSLY EXCEEDED THE PRICE AT WHICH  THE  SAME
 OR  SIMILAR  DRUG  SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE WAS READILY OBTAINABLE BY OTHER
 PURCHASERS IN THE TRADE AREA.
  (C) A DEFENDANT MAY REBUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE WITH EVIDENCE THAT:
  (I) THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT CHARGED PRESERVES THE MARGIN OF  PROFIT
 THAT  THE  DEFENDANT  RECEIVED  FOR  THE SAME DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE
 PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE SHORTAGE; OR
  (II) ADDITIONAL COSTS NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL  OF  THE  DEFENDANT  WERE
 IMPOSED ON THE DEFENDANT FOR THE DRUG SUBJECT TO A SHORTAGE.
  4.  WHERE A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION IS ALLEGED TO HAVE OCCURRED, THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY APPLY IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW
 YORK TO THE SUPREME COURT WITHIN THE JUDICIAL  DISTRICT  IN  WHICH  SUCH
 VIOLATION  IS  ALLEGED  TO HAVE OCCURRED, ON NOTICE OF FIVE DAYS, FOR AN
 ORDER ENJOINING OR RESTRAINING COMMISSION OR CONTINUANCE OF THE  ALLEGED
 UNLAWFUL  ACTS.  IN  ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE COURT SHALL IMPOSE A CIVIL
 PENALTY IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO  EXCEED  TWENTY-FIVE  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  PER
 VIOLATION  OR  THREE  TIMES  THE  GROSS  RECEIPTS  FOR THE RELEVANT DRUG
 SUBJECT TO THE SHORTAGE, WHICHEVER IS GREATER,  AND  WHERE  APPROPRIATE,
 ORDER RESTITUTION TO AGGRIEVED PARTIES.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
