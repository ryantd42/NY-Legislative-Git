  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Better Sleep Month in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Better Sleep Month in the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Better
Sleep Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Refreshing sleep is of huge importance to staying healthy;
the goal of Better Sleep Month  is  to  encourage  people  to  establish
better sleeping patterns; and
 
  WHEREAS, Better Sleep Month is supported by the Better Sleep Council
(BSC),  which aims to raise awareness about the benefits of better sleep
and how poor sleep can disrupt our lives; as  with  diet  and  exercise,
sleep is crucial to our physical, emotional and mental health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Inadequate sleep can lead to an increase in blood pressure
and stress hormone production; the body can become stressed when it does
not get enough sleep; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  consequences  of  poor  sleep  include  reduced
concentration,  mood swings, irritability, stress, and a weakened immune
system; the release of stress hormones can also make it harder to sleep,
perpetuating an unhealthy sleep cycle; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
health  issue,  and more must be done to increase activity at the local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Better Sleep
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
