  fees,  sexual offender registration fees, or supplemental sex offender
  victim fees (Part G)
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act enacts into law major  components  of  legislation
 relating to ending the unfair financial burdens imposed on defendants in
 criminal,  vehicle and traffic, or other types of criminal or quasi-cri-
 minal matters by the existence of mandatory court surcharges  and  fees,
 mandatory  minimum  fines  and mandatory probation or parole fees.  This
 act further enacts into law procedures by which courts would be required
 to engage in an individualized assessment of a person's financial abili-
 ty to pay a fine prior to imposing a fine, eliminates  the  availability
 of  incarceration  as  a remedy for a failure to pay a fine, and vacates
 all existing warrants or unsatisfied civil judgments issued solely based
 on a person's failure to timely pay a fine, surcharge,  or  fee.  Each
 component  is  wholly  contained  within  a  Part  identified as Parts A
 through G. The effective date for each  particular  provision  contained
 within  such  Part  is  set  forth in the last section of such Part. Any
 provision in any section contained within a Part, including  the  effec-
 tive date of the Part, which makes reference to a section "of this act",
 when  used in connection with that particular component, shall be deemed
 to mean and refer to the corresponding section of the Part in  which  it
 is  found.  Section  four of this act sets forth the general effective
 date of this act.
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislative intent of this act is to  end
 the inequitable financial burdens placed on defendants by the previously
 enacted statutory provisions which have authorized or mandated the impo-
 sition  of  surcharges, fees, and/or mandatory minimum fines, which have
 had a disparate impact on poor defendants, people of  color,  and  those
 who  lack  access  to  the  significant financial resources necessary in
 order to satisfy the imposition of  surcharges,  fees,  and  fines,  and
 which have also contributed to mass incarceration in New York state. The
 legislative  intent  is  also  to  end New York's regressive reliance on
 generating governmental revenue by imposing surcharges, fees, and  fines
 on those least able to pay.
 
  PART A
 
  Section 1. Section 60.35 of the penal law is REPEALED.
  § 2. Section 1809 of the vehicle and traffic law is REPEALED.

  If the court determines that the incarcerated individual has  insuffi-
 cient  means to pay the full filing fee, the court may permit the incar-
 A. 4183  3
 
 cerated individual to pay a reduced filing fee,  the  minimum  of  which
 shall  not  be  less than fifteen dollars and the maximum of which shall
 not be more than fifty dollars.  The  court  shall  require  an  initial
 payment  of  such  portion of the reduced filing fee as the incarcerated
 individual can reasonably afford or shall authorize no  initial  payment
 of the fee if exceptional circumstances render the incarcerated individ-
 ual unable to pay any fee; provided however, that the difference between
 the  amount  of the reduced filing fee and the amount paid by the incar-
 cerated individual in the initial  partial  payment  shall  be  assessed
 against  the  incarcerated individual as an outstanding obligation to be
 collected either by the superintendent or the municipal official of  the
 facility  at  which the incarcerated individual is confined, as the case
 may be[, in the same manner that mandatory surcharges are  collected  as
 provided for in subdivision five of section 60.35 of the penal law]. The
 court  shall  notify the superintendent or the municipal official of the
 facility where the incarcerated individual is housed of  the  amount  of
 the reduced filing fee that was not directed to be paid by the incarcer-
 ated  individual.  Thereafter, the superintendent or the municipal offi-
 cial shall forward to the court  any  fee  obligations  that  have  been
 collected, provided however, that:
  § 11. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 259-i of the executive
 law,  as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, subparagraph (i) as
 amended by chapter 486 of the laws  of  2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, at
 least one month prior to the date on which  an  incarcerated  individual
 may be paroled pursuant to subdivision one of section 70.40 of the penal
 law,  a  member or members as determined by the rules of the board shall
 personally interview such incarcerated individual and determine  whether
 he  or  she  should be paroled in accordance with the guidelines adopted
 pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this
 article. If parole is not granted upon  such  review,  the  incarcerated
 individual shall be informed in writing within two weeks of such appear-
 ance  of the factors and reasons for such denial of parole. Such reasons
 shall be given in detail and not in conclusory terms.  The  board  shall
 specify  a date not more than twenty-four months from such determination
 for reconsideration, and the procedures to be followed upon  reconsider-
 ation  shall be the same. If the incarcerated individual is released, he
 or she shall be given a copy of the conditions of  parole.  Such  condi-
 tions  shall  where  appropriate, include a requirement that the parolee
 comply with any restitution order, [mandatory  surcharge,  sex  offender
 registration  fee and DNA databank fee] previously imposed by a court of
 competent jurisdiction that applies to the parolee. The conditions shall
 indicate which restitution collection agency established under  subdivi-
 sion  eight  of  section  420.10 of the criminal procedure law, shall be
 responsible for collection of  restitution[,  mandatory  surcharge,  sex
 offender  registration  fees  and  DNA  databank fees as provided for in
 section 60.35 of the penal law and section eighteen hundred nine of  the
 vehicle and traffic law]. If the incarcerated individual is released, he
 or  she  shall also be notified in writing that his or her voting rights
 will be restored upon release.
  (ii) Any incarcerated individual  who  is  scheduled  for  presumptive
 release  pursuant  to  section  eight  hundred six of the correction law
 shall not appear before the board as provided  in  subparagraph  (i)  of
 this  paragraph unless such incarcerated individual's scheduled presump-
 tive release  is  forfeited,  canceled,  or  rescinded  subsequently  as
 A. 4183  4
 
 provided  in  such law. In such event, the incarcerated individual shall
 appear before the board for release consideration as provided in subpar-
 agraph (i) of this paragraph as soon thereafter as is practicable.
  § 12. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 259-i of the executive
 law,  as  amended by chapter 486 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (a) At least one month prior to the expiration of the  minimum  period
 or  periods  of  imprisonment  fixed  by the court or board, a member or
 members as determined by the rules of the board shall personally  inter-
 view  an  incarcerated  individual serving an indeterminate sentence and
 determine whether he or she should be paroled at the expiration  of  the
 minimum  period  or  periods  in  accordance with the procedures adopted
 pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this
 article. If parole is not granted upon  such  review,  the  incarcerated
 individual shall be informed in writing within two weeks of such appear-
 ance  of the factors and reasons for such denial of parole. Such reasons
 shall be given in detail and not in conclusory terms.  The  board  shall
 specify  a date not more than twenty-four months from such determination
 for reconsideration, and the procedures to be followed upon  reconsider-
 ation  shall be the same. If the incarcerated individual is released, he
 or she shall be given a copy of the conditions of  parole.  Such  condi-
 tions  shall  where  appropriate, include a requirement that the parolee
 comply with any restitution order [and mandatory  surcharge]  previously
 imposed  by  a court of competent jurisdiction that applies to the paro-
 lee. The conditions shall indicate which restitution  collection  agency
 established  under  subdivision  eight of section 420.10 of the criminal
 procedure law, shall be responsible for collection of  restitution  [and
 mandatory  surcharge  as  provided for in section 60.35 of the penal law
 and section eighteen hundred nine of the vehicle and  traffic  law].  If
 the  incarcerated  individual is released, he or she shall also be noti-
 fied in writing that his or her voting  rights  will  be  restored  upon
 release.
  §  12-a.  Section  257-c  of  the  executive law is REPEALED and a new
 section 257-c is added to read as follows:
  §  257-C.  PROBATION  FEES  PROHIBITED.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER
 PROVISION  OF  LAW,  NO COUNTY OR CITY MAY REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY
 SERVING OR WHO  SHALL  BE  SENTENCED  TO  A  PERIOD  OF  PROBATION  UPON
 CONVICTION  OF ANY CRIME TO PAY ANY FEE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN
 ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, SUPERVISION FEE, MONITORING  FEE,  TESTING  FEE,  OR
 SCREENING FEE, TO THE LOCAL PROBATION DEPARTMENT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY
 OF  SUPERVISING  THE  PROBATIONER.  NOTHING  IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL BE
 CONSTRUED TO AFFECT THE COLLECTION OF RESTITUTION PAYMENTS  PURSUANT  TO
 SECTIONS  65.10  AND  60.27  OF  THE  PENAL LAW AND SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF
 SECTION 420.10 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW.
  § 12-b.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  2  of  section  205  of  the
 correction  law,  as  amended  by  chapter  491  of the laws of 2021, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) A merit termination granted by the department under  this  section
 shall  constitute a termination of the sentence with respect to which it
 was granted. No such merit  termination  shall  be  granted  unless  the
 department  is  satisfied  that termination of sentence from presumptive
 release, parole, conditional release or post-release supervision  is  in
 the  best interest of society[, and that the parolee or releasee, other-
 wise financially able to comply with an order  of  restitution  and  the
 payment  of  any  mandatory  surcharge  previously imposed by a court of
 A. 4183  5

 competent jurisdiction, has made a good faith effort  to  comply  there-
 with].
  § 12-c. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 259-j of the executive law, as
 amended by section 38-g of subpart A of part C of chapter 62 of the laws
 of 2011, are amended to read as follows:
  1.  Except where a determinate sentence was imposed for a felony other
 than a felony defined in article two  hundred  twenty  [or  article  two
 hundred  twenty-one]  of the penal law, if the board of parole is satis-
 fied that an absolute discharge from presumptive release, parole, condi-
 tional release or release to a period of post-release supervision is  in
 the  best  interests  of  society,  the board may grant such a discharge
 prior to the expiration of the full term or maximum term to  any  person
 who  has  been  on  unrevoked  community  supervision for at least three
 consecutive years. A discharge granted under this section shall  consti-
 tute a termination of the sentence with respect to which it was granted.
 [No  such  discharge shall be granted unless the board is satisfied that
 the parolee or releasee, otherwise financially able to  comply  with  an
 order  of  restitution  and  the payment of any mandatory surcharge, sex
 offender registration fee or DNA databank fee previously  imposed  by  a
 court  of competent jurisdiction, has made a good faith effort to comply
 therewith.]
  3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the  contra-
 ry, where a term of post-release supervision in excess of five years has
 been  imposed  on  a  person convicted of a crime defined in article one
 hundred thirty of the penal law, including a sexually motivated  felony,
 the  board of parole may grant a discharge from post-release supervision
 prior to the expiration of the maximum term of post-release supervision.
 Such a discharge may be granted only after  the  person  has  served  at
 least  five  years of post-release supervision, and only to a person who
 has been on  unrevoked  post-release  supervision  for  at  least  three
 consecutive  years.  No such discharge shall be granted unless the board
 of parole or the department acting pursuant to its responsibility  under
 subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred  one  of  the correction law
 consults with any  licensed  psychologist,  qualified  psychiatrist,  or
 other  mental  health professional who is providing care or treatment to
 the supervisee; and the board[: (a)] determines that  a  discharge  from
 post-release  supervision  is in the best interests of society[; and (b)
 is satisfied that the supervisee, otherwise financially able  to  comply
 with an order of restitution and the payment of any mandatory surcharge,
 sex  offender  registration fee, or DNA data bank fee previously imposed
 by a court of competent jurisdiction, has made a good  faith  effort  to
 comply  therewith].  Before making a determination to discharge a person
 from a period of post-release  supervision,  the  board  of  parole  may
 request  that  the commissioner of the office of mental health arrange a
 psychiatric evaluation of the supervisee. A discharge granted under this
 section shall constitute a termination of the sentence with  respect  to
 which it was granted.

 pursuant  to subdivision three of section two hundred twenty-six, subdi-
 vision four of section two hundred twenty-seven, OR  subdivision  four-a

 chief  executive  officer  of  any  such  city,  the commissioner, after
 consultation with the commissioner of the department of motor  vehicles,
 may authorize the use of a parking ticket other than the uniform parking
 ticket  prescribed pursuant to this section if he or she determines that
 use of such other parking ticket is not inconsistent with, and will  not
 diminish  the  effectiveness  of, the parking violations enforcement and

 ty-seven-j  of this chapter, and may also authorize for a specified time
 period the use of a parking ticket which was used by  such  city  on  or

 eighteen hundred nine-b of this chapter]. No provision of law  shall  be
 deemed to preclude a county or the city of New York from receiving funds
 [from  other  sources] to be deposited in the handicapped parking educa-
 tion fund, provided such funds are used in a  manner  and  for  purposes
 consistent with this section. The moneys of such fund shall be disbursed

  5.  Application  for  resentence.  In  any case where the defendant is
 unable to pay a fine, restitution or reparation imposed by the court, he
 may at any time apply to the court for resentence. In such case, if  the
 court  is satisfied that the defendant is unable to pay the fine, resti-
 tution or reparation it must:
  (a) Adjust the terms of payment; or
  (b) Lower the amount of the fine,  restitution  or  reparation  TO  AN
 AMOUNT  THE  DEFENDANT  IS  ABLE  TO PAY, OR REVOKE IT ENTIRELY FROM THE
 SENTENCE IF THE DEFENDANT HAS NO ABILITY TO PAY; or
  (c) [Where the sentence consists of probation or  imprisonment  and  a
 fine,  restitution  or  reparation,  revoke  the portion of the sentence
 imposing the fine, restitution or reparation; or
  (d)] Revoke the entire sentence imposed and resentence the  defendant.
 Upon  such  resentence  the  court may impose any sentence it originally
 could have imposed, except that the amount of any fine,  restitution  or
 reparation  imposed  may not be in excess of the amount the defendant is
 able to pay AND THAT THE COURT MAY NOT SENTENCE  THE  DEFENDANT  TO  ANY
 TERM  OF  IMPRISONMENT, PROBATION, OR POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION IN EXCESS
 OF ANY SUCH TERM IMPOSED BY THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE.
  In any case where the defendant applies for resentencing with  respect
 to  any  condition of the sentence relating to restitution or reparation
 the court must order that notice of such application  and  a  reasonable
 opportunity  to  be heard be given to the person or persons given notice
 pursuant to subdivision one of this section. If  the  court  grants  the
 defendant's  application  by changing the original order for restitution
 or reparation in any manner, the court must place the  reasons  therefor
 on the record.
  [For  the  purposes of this subdivision, the court shall not determine
 that the defendant is unable to pay the fine, restitution or  reparation
 ordered  solely  because  of  such  defendant's  incarceration but shall
 consider all the defendant's sources of income including, but not limit-
 ed to, moneys in the possession of an  incarcerated  individual  at  the
 time  of his or her admission into such facility, funds earned by him or
 her in a work release program as defined in subdivision four of  section
 one  hundred  fifty of the correction law, funds earned by him or her as
 provided for in section one hundred eighty-seven of the  correction  law
 and  any  other funds received by him or her or on his or her behalf and
 deposited with the superintendent  or  the  municipal  official  of  the
 facility where the person is confined.]
