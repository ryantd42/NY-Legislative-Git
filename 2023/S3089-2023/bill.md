 Introduced  by  Sen.  LANZA  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Children and Families
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to  creating  the  multi-
  disciplinary team demonstration program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The utilization of multi-disciplinary
 teams (MDTs) can be extremely valuable in the implementation of  certain
 programs,  particularly  those  which  are  likely  to have a widespread
 impact and affect several professions, as is the case with most  systems
 of  mandatory reporting. MDTs make use of the experience, expertise, and
 perspectives which may be unique to individuals involved in one  of  the
 affected  professions.  Before a program is implemented which may have a
 broad impact, MDTs can be a valuable resource in developing an effective
 strategy  that  minimizes  unintended  negative  consequences.  In  many
 instances, it is appropriate for a government entity to establish an MDT
 with which the entity may collaborate with and seek input from regarding
 the specifics of a planned project.
  Beyond  the general usefulness of MDTs, where a proposed program which
 will affect the members of many professions is to be created by statute,
 it is often recommended to  also  include  language  providing  for  the
 establishment  of MDT to provide input on any specifics not contained in
 the statute. This inclusion ensures that the involved professions have a
 chance to be heard before a program is implemented in a way which  might
 adversely  affect  the  members  of  such professions or the individuals
 served by the professions.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a  new  section  501-i  to
 read as follows:
  §  501-I. MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. THE OFFICE OF
 CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED, IN  CONJUNCTION  WITH
 THE  OFFICE FOR THE AGING, TO ESTABLISH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM DEMON-

 STRATION PROGRAM, SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM,  TO
 ESTABLISH MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR COMPLEX CASES
 OF ADULT ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION. SUCH MULTI-DISCIPLI-
 NARY  TEAMS  WILL  BE COMPRISED OF PROFESSIONALS ACROSS DISCIPLINES THAT
 PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PROFES-
 SIONAL DISCIPLINES, AS WELL AS  A  FULL-TIME,  SKILLED  AND  EXPERIENCED
 MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM COORDINATOR FOR EACH DEMONSTRATION LOCATION. THE
 MULTI-DISCIPLINARY  TEAM  COORDINATOR  WILL  PROVIDE  CASE CONSULTATION,
 TRIAGE CASES, FACILITATE COUNTY-LEVEL MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM  MEETINGS,
 MONITOR  PROGRESS, AND FACILITATE COORDINATION AND COOPERATIVE ACTION IN
 THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO  AN  INDIVIDUAL  IDENTIFIED  AS
 BEING  A VICTIM OF ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION, AS WELL AS
 OTHER DUTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE  ROLE.  SUCH  MULTI-DISCIPLINARY  TEAMS
 SHALL CONSIST OF REPRESENTATION BY PROFESSIONALS GENERALLY AUTHORIZED TO
 MAKE  DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR AGENCY FROM SELECTED PUBLIC, PRIVATE,
 AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES INCLUDING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO  HEALTH/MEDICAL,
 MENTAL  HEALTH, AGING, PROTECTIVE SERVICES, HUMAN SERVICES, SOCIAL WORK,
 BANKING/FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,  LEGAL  SERVICES,  AND  LAW  ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCIES,  AND  INCLUDE  SPECIALTY SERVICES SUCH AS FORENSIC ACCOUNTING,
 GERIATRICS, AND PSYCHIATRY/GEROPSYCHIATRY, ON A FEE-FOR-SERVICE BASIS. A
 SECURE DATABASE USE  BY  THE  MULTI-DISCIPLINARY  TEAM  COORDINATOR  FOR
 INTAKE,  TRACKING,  AND  OUTCOMES  OF SUCH CASES WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND
 USED AS PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
