 eighteen of this chapter. THE  CIVIL  PENALTIES  PROVIDED  FOR  IN  THIS

  §  2.  The  opening  paragraph  of subdivision 1 of section 218 of the
 labor law, as amended by chapter 2 of the laws of 2015,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  an  employer  has  violated a
 provision of article six (payment of wages), article  nineteen  (minimum
 wage  act),  article  nineteen-A  (minimum wage standards and protective
 labor practices for farm workers), ARTICLE TWENTY-ONE-A (WAREHOUSE WORK-
 ER PROTECTION ACT), section two hundred twelve-a,  section  two  hundred
 twelve-b,  section  one  hundred  sixty-one (day of rest) or section one
 hundred sixty-two (meal periods) of this chapter, or  a  rule  or  regu-
 lation  promulgated  thereunder,  the  commissioner  shall  issue to the
 employer an order directing compliance therewith, which  shall  describe
 particularly  the  nature of the alleged violation. A copy of such order
 shall be provided to any employee who has  filed  a  complaint  and  any
 authorized  representative  of  him  or  her.  In  addition to directing
 payment of wages, benefits or wage supplements  found  to  be  due,  and
 liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred percent of unpaid wages,
 such  order,  if  issued to an employer who previously has been found in
 violation of those provisions, rules or regulations, or to  an  employer
 whose  violation  is  willful  or egregious, shall direct payment to the
 commissioner of an additional sum as a civil penalty in an amount not to
 exceed double the total amount of wages, benefits, or  wage  supplements
 found  to be due. In no case shall the order direct payment of an amount
 less than the total wages, benefits or wage  supplements  found  by  the
 commissioner to be due, plus the liquidated damages in the amount of one
 hundred  percent  of  unpaid  wages,  the appropriate civil penalty, and
 interest at the rate of interest then in effect, as  prescribed  by  the
 superintendent  of  financial services pursuant to section fourteen-a of
 the banking law per annum from the date of the underpayment to the  date
 of  the  payment.  Where  the  violation  is for a reason other than the
 employer's failure to pay wages, benefits or wage supplements  found  to
 be  due,  the  order shall direct payment to the commissioner of a civil
 penalty in an amount not to exceed one  thousand  dollars  for  a  first
 violation, two thousand dollars for a second violation or three thousand
 dollars  for a third or subsequent violation. In assessing the amount of
 the penalty, the commissioner shall give due consideration to  the  size
 S. 851  6
 
 of  the  employer's  business,  the  good faith basis of the employer to
 believe that its conduct was in compliance with the law, the gravity  of
 the  violation,  the  history of previous violations and, in the case of
 wages,  benefits  or  supplements violations, the failure to comply with
 recordkeeping or other non-wage requirements.

 proposed  in  legislative  bills  numbers  S.  8922-A and A. 10020-A, is

 FOR  THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF  THIS  ACT  ON ITS  EFFECTIVE  DATE  ARE
 AUTHORIZED TO BE MADE BY THE COMMISSIONER ON OR  BEFORE  SUCH  EFFECTIVE
 DATE.
  §  4.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
