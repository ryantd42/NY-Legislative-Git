 Introduced by M. of A. THIELE -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the not-for-profit corporation law and the education
  law, in relation to the discovery and disposition of human remains and
  funerary objects; and to amend  the  parks,  recreation  and  historic
  preservation  law, in relation to requiring certain notice and consul-
  tation prior to the undertaking of certain projects
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "unmarked burial site protection act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature  finds  and
 declares  that  the  sanctity  of human burial sites is an intrinsic and
 paramount value among all cultural and religious traditions which  prac-
 tice  the custom of burying the dead. The legislature further finds that
 there are numerous unmarked burial sites throughout the state,  many  of
 which are of great cultural and historical significance to the people of
 the  state, particularly to members of the cultural and religious groups
 affiliated  with  them.  Such  sites  are  vulnerable  to  unintentional
 disturbance  in  the course of construction and other activities as well
 as deliberate vandalism and  looting.  Such  disturbance  constitutes  a
 severe  offense  against the descendants of the dead and the beliefs and
 traditions of the culturally-affiliated groups.
  The legislature finds and declares that existing laws  are  inadequate
 to  protect  these  unmarked burial sites from disturbance, and that New
 York is one of the very few states  which  heretofore  has  provided  no
 express  statutory protection for unmarked burial sites. It is therefore
 declared to be the purpose of this act to ensure that human remains  and
 associated  funerary  artifacts remain undisturbed to the maximum extent
 practicable, and are treated with the utmost respect consistent with the
 wishes of lineal descendants and culturally-affiliated groups.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
