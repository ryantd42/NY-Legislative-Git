BY: M. of A. Simpson
 
  HONORING  Viviana  Bravo  upon the occasion of her
  designation  for  special  recognition  at  the
  Chestertown  Firehouse  for her prompt actions while
  at the scene of a medical emergency on  May 25, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
recognize  and  acknowledge  those  within  our  midst  who  have  made
significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
caring concern and heroic acts of exemplary citizens who take prompt and
appropriate action in emergency situations, and in doing so, help others
to avert life-threatening danger; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Viviana  Bravo  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition at the Chestertown Firehouse for her prompt actions while at
the scene of a medical emergency on May 25, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, Viviana Bravo will be recognized for her  selfless  heroism
on Friday, June 2, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At approximately 5:45 pm, on Wednesday, May 25, 2022, then
17-year-old Viviana Bravo and her  friend  Elizabeth  Mae  Maxwell  were
driving  on  the  Adirondack State Northway between exits 15 and 16 when
they noticed a truck swerving in between the lanes in front of them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Peter and Susan Michalski were also driving along the  road
when he suddenly lost consciousness; after Susan was able to safely pull
the  vehicle  over  to the side of the road, Viviana Bravo and Elizabeth
Mae Maxwell also pulled over and immediately called 911  before  running
over to help the couple; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon their arrival, Viviana Bravo and Elizabeth Mae Maxwell
quickly  noticed  Susan  Michalski  was  panicking  because  Peter  was
unconscious and had stopped breathing; without regard for their  safety,
the  two teenagers opened the car door, pulled Peter out of the driver's
seat, carefully placed him on the ground, and began to  perform  CPR  on
him, the first time they had done so on a human being; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shortly thereafter, the Wilton EMS arrived on the scene and
took  over  with  an  AED to continue life-saving measures; the two good
samaritans stayed with Susan Michalski to comfort her and pray with  her
while EMS was working on Peter; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thanks to the swift and lifesaving actions of Viviana Bravo
and  Elizabeth Mae Maxwell, Peter Michalski recovered from a ventricular
fibrillation  event  after  spending  10  weeks  in  several  medical
facilities,  and  was  able  to  continue  his life as a loving husband,
father, and grampy to his six grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS, First generation  Mexican-American  Viviana  Bravo  studied
culinary  arts and hospitality at BOCES where she was an award winner at
the SkillsUSA competition; today, she is a  sophomore  at  the  Culinary
Institute  of  America  pursuing  her  bachelor's  degree in Hospitality
Management; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Viviana Bravo, through her spontaneous and heroic actions,
demonstrated her character and her compassion for the welfare of others,
personifying, by virtue  of  her  actions,  the  collective  concern  of
ordinary  citizens  across  the  community  of the State of New York who
voluntarily respond when others are in need of help; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Viviana Bravo upon the occasion of  her  designation  for  special
recognition at the Chestertown Firehouse for her prompt actions while at
the scene of a medical emergency on May 25, 2022; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Viviana Bravo.
