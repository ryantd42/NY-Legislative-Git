Assembly Resolution No. 291
 
BY: M. of A. Buttenschon
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  72nd  Annual observance of the
  National Day of Prayer in the State of New  York  on
  Thursday, May 4, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  course  of the evolving development of this great
Empire State, if  the  ingredients  of  shared  concern  and  responsive
endeavor  combine  in  the symmetry of a commitment to governance, there
have emerged among the facilities of  the  State  of  New  York  certain
events which warrant commemoration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern, and fully in accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
commemorate  the 72nd Annual observance of the National Day of Prayer in
the State of New York on Thursday, May 4, 2023;  this  year's  theme  is
"Pray  Fervently  in Righteousness and Avail Much" based on James 5:16B;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The 72nd Annual National Day of Prayer will  have  profound
significance as millions of Americans join together to pray at thousands
of events across the county; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Prayer  has  always been an important part of our nation's
heritage; National Day of Prayer is a tradition first proclaimed by  the
Continental Congress in 1775, when John Hancock signed the congressional
order establishing the first Day of Prayer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In keeping with our founding fathers' faith, civic prayers
and national days of prayer have a long and  venerable  history  in  our
constitutional  republic;  in  1983,  in  MARSH V. CHAMBERS, the Supreme
Court affirmed the right of state legislatures to  open  their  sessions
with  prayer,  a tradition that is honored by the New York State Senate;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The observance of a National Day of Prayer became  the  law
of  the  land in 1952 when a resolution asking people "to turn to God in
prayer and meditation," was  unanimously  passed  by  Congress  and  was
signed by President Harry Truman; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  amendment  to  this law was signed by President Ronald
Reagan in 1988, designating the first Thursday in May as the annual  Day
of Prayer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since our nation's earliest days, Americans have prayed as
a  way  of  guiding,  uniting,  and  healing;  in  times  of  peace  and
prosperity, tragedy and joy, prayer has provided comfort and sustenance;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is fitting and proper to give thanks to God by observing
this  National  Day of Prayer in New York State on May 4, 2023, when all
may acknowledge our blessings and  express  gratitude  for  them,  while
recognizing the need for strengthening religious and moral values in our
State and nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 72nd consecutive  observance  of  the  National  Day  of
Prayer  in  the  State of New York on Thursday, May 4, 2023, and to urge
the citizens of New York to observe this day in ways appropriate to  its
importance and significance; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Greater Utica National Day of  Prayer  Committee  and
National Day of Prayer committees throughout New York State.
