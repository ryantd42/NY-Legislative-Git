 preceding the date that an institutionalized individual is both institu-
 tionalized and has applied for medical assistance[, or in the case of  a

 ty-month  period  immediately  preceding the date that such non-institu-
 tionalized individual applies for medical assistance  coverage  of  long
 term care services. Nothing herein precludes a review of eligibility for
 retroactive authorization for medical expenses incurred during the three
 months prior to the month of application for medical assistance].
