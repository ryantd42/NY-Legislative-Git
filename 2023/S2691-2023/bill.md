 any  time  made,  may include any of the above. Such planning commission

  §  2.  Paragraph  (d) of subdivision 3 of section 239-c of the general
 municipal law, as added by chapter 451 of the laws of 1997,  is  amended
 to read as follows:
  (d)  County  studies.  The county planning board may undertake studies
 relevant to the future growth, development, and protection of the county
 and municipalities therein, including studies in  support  of  a  county
 comprehensive  plan.  FOR ANY SUCH STUDIES THAT REQUIRE STRATEGIC PLAN-
 NING AND CONSULTATION OF OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL MAPS OF THE COUNTY,  THE
 COUNTY PLANNING BOARD MAY REQUEST ASSISTANCE FROM THE OFFICE OF INFORMA-
 TION  TECHNOLOGY  SERVICES,  WHICH SHALL ASSIST WITH ANY MAPPING, UPON A
 SHOWING OF NEED BY THE COUNTY PLANNING BOARD UPON REQUEST BY THE  OFFICE
 AS DEFINED BY SECTION ONE HUNDRED THREE OF THE STATE TECHNOLOGY LAW.
  §  3.  Section  273  of the town law, as amended by chapter 486 of the
 laws of 1956, is amended to read as follows:
  § 273. Official map,  changes.  Such  town  board  is  authorized  and
 empowered, whenever and as often as it may deem it for the public inter-
 est,  to  change or add to the official map of the town so as to lay out
 new streets, highways, drainage systems or parks, or to widen  or  close
 existing  streets,  highways, drainage systems or parks within that part
 of the town outside the limits of any incorporated city or  village.  At
 least  ten  days' notice of a public hearing on any proposed action with
 reference to any such change in the official map shall be published in a
 newspaper of general circulation in such town. Before  making  any  such
 addition  or  change, the town board shall refer the matter to the plan-
 ning board for report thereon, but if the planning board shall not  make
 its  report  within  thirty days of such reference, it shall forfeit the
 right further to  suspend  action.  Such  additions  and  changes,  when
 adopted,  shall become a part of the official map of the town, and shall
 be deemed to be final and conclusive with respect to the location of the
 streets, highways, drainage systems and parks shown thereon. The layout,
 widening or closing, or the approval of the layout, widening or closing,
 of streets, highways, drainage systems or parks, by the town  board,  or
 the  town superintendent of highways, under provisions of law other than
 those contained in this article, shall be deemed to be  an  addition  or
 change  of  the official map, and shall be subject to all the provisions
 of this article with regard to such additions or changes.  FOR ANY  SUCH
 ADDITION  OR  CHANGE  THAT IS MADE AS PART OF A STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OR
 POLICY, THE PLANNING BOARD MAY REQUEST ASSISTANCE  FROM  THE  OFFICE  OF
 INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  SERVICES,  WHICH SHALL ASSIST WITH ANY MAPPING,
 UPON A SHOWING OF NEED BY THE PLANNING BOARD UPON REQUEST BY THE  OFFICE
 AS DEFINED BY SECTION ONE HUNDRED THREE OF THE STATE TECHNOLOGY LAW.
  §  4.  Section  103 of the state technology law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 7-b to read as follows:
  7-B. TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY SERVICES INCLUDING  GEOGRAPHIC  INFORMATION
 SYSTEM  MAPPING  UPON  REQUEST  BY  ANY  MUNICIPALITY, PROVIDED THAT THE
 OFFICE MAY REQUEST A SHOWING OF NEED FROM ANY MUNICIPALITY. FOR PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION, A SHOWING OF NEED SHALL BE APPROVED IF THE MUNICIPALITY
 DEMONSTRATES THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING GEOGRAPHIC  INFORMA-
 TION SYSTEM MAPPING BY THE OFFICE WILL ASSIST THE MUNICIPALITY IN MAKING
 STRATEGIC  DEVELOPMENT  OR  POLICY  DETERMINATIONS INVOLVING A REVIEW OF
 FLOOR SPACE USAGE WITHIN ITS GEOGRAPHIC BORDERS  AND  BUSINESS,  EMPLOY-
 MENT, AND OTHER CAPACITY USAGE INFORMATION.
  §  5.  The  executive  law is amended by adding a new section 105-a to
 read as follows:
  § 105-A. MUNICIPAL STUDY ASSISTANCE. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CAUSE  THE

 NOLOGY SERVICES, A PROGRAM OR SYSTEM THAT SHALL ASSIST COUNTIES OR MUNI-
 CIPALITIES  IN  THE  CONDUCTING  OF  A STUDY OF THE TOTAL USAGE OF FLOOR
 SPACE WITHIN THE GIVEN COUNTY OR  MUNICIPAL  BORDERS.  SUCH  PROGRAM  OR
 SYSTEM  SHALL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, METHO-
 DOLOGICAL SUPPORT, AND ANY TECHNOLOGY SERVICES THAT  ARE  DEEMED  TO  BE
 USEFUL  TO  A  COUNTY  OR MUNICIPALITY CAUSING SUCH A STUDY TO BE TAKEN.
 THE USE OF SUCH PROGRAM OR SYSTEM SHALL ONLY BE USED WHERE  THE  PURPOSE
 OF  SUCH  STUDY  SHALL  BE  TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL FLOOR SPACE AVAILABLE
 WITHIN A GIVEN SUBDIVISION, THE PERCENTAGE OF FLOOR SPACE USED FOR RESI-
 DENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES, AND THE  CREATION  OF  ANY
 STRATEGIC PLAN RELATED TO RESPONSES ON SUCH FLOOR SPACE STUDY.
