 AN ACT to amend the public health law and the education law, in relation
  to chronic pain management
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative  intent:  The  legislature  hereby  finds  that
 medical  treatment  of chronic pain in this state needs to be reexamined
 to enhance the ability to assess  such  condition,  increase  access  to
 appropriate  care  to  treat  and mitigate chronic pain, and improve the
 quality of life for  those  afflicted  with  this  condition.  Currently
 chronic  pain  is  most  often treated by primary care providers who may
 have little training in the assessment and proper treatment  of  complex
 chronic  pain  conditions.  This,  in  turn, has led, in certain circum-
 stances, to patients seeing multiple health care providers  and  experi-
 encing  multiple  and repeated diagnostic tests, that lead to inadequate
 or unproven surgeries, prescription of unneeded or strong  pain  medica-
 tions, with its consequential heightened possibility to lead to the long
 term  addiction  to such strong pain medications, and the performance of
 procedures or treatment regimens that are not able to successfully treat
 or mitigate such chronic pain.
  Further, the current practice of the repeated utilization of different
 health practitioners, tests and unnecessary medical procedures to  treat
 such  chronic  pain  is  resulting  in higher health care costs.  These
 increased costs come from unnecessary visits to health care  practition-
 ers, more and longer hospital stays, performing unnecessary surgeries or
 other  medical  procedures,  and  unnecessary prescription of costly and
 dangerous drugs. This inefficient use of valuable health care  resources
 is contributing to the rapidly increasing cost of providing health care.
 With  the  continuing aging of New York's general population, this trend
 may only  continue  to  grow.  Further,  the  consequences  to  patients

 afflicted  with  chronic  pain  will continue to undermine the physical,
 social, economic and psychological well being of  such  patients,  their
 families and loved ones.
  The  current  health  care delivery system both over treats and under-
 treats those afflicted with chronic pain. Ideally, all patients  subject
 to  chronic  pain  should be able to obtain an appropriate assessment of
 the underlying conditions that cause such pain, followed by an appropri-
 ate plan of care that reflects the best practices currently available to
 prevent the adverse effects of pain. Such care should be provided  in  a
 coordinated  manner  that minimizes such chronic pain and is cost effec-
 tive for the patient, health care delivery system, and for employers  of
 such  persons.  In sum, the provision of chronic pain treatments needs a
 major reassessment to enhance assessment capabilities,  increase  access
 to  appropriate care, improve the quality of care, and do so in a manner
 that minimizes the cost of providing such care.
