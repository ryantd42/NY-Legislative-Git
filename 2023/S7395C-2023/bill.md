 AN  ACT  in  relation to authorizing the assessor of the town of Ramapo,
  county of Rockland, to accept an application for a real  property  tax
  exemption from Sister Servants of Mary Immaculate Inc.
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town  of  Ramapo,  county  of  Rockland,  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from Sister Servants of Mary Immaculate Inc.  an
 application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to  section
 462  of  the real property tax law with respect to the 2022-2023 assess-
 ment rolls for all of the 2022-2023 school taxes and all of the 2022 and
 2023 general taxes for the parcel owned by such organization located  at
 92  Eagle Valley Road, town of Sloatsburg, county of Rockland, otherwise
 known as Rockland county tax map section 03/38.41, block 1, lot 1-3.  If
 accepted,  the  application shall be reviewed as if it had been received
 on or before the taxable status date  established  for  such  assessment
 roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval by the town board of Ramapo, may make appropriate correction to
 the subject roll. If such exemption is granted  and  such  organization,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject roll, the
 applicable governing body or tax department may, in its sole discretion,
 provide  for  the  refund  of  those  taxes paid and cancel those taxes,
 fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
