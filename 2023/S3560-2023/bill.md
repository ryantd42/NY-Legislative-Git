 are amended to read as follows:
  [Application  forms  for  exemption  under this section shall be filed
 with the assessors between February first and March fifteenth and, based
 on the certification of the local housing agency as herein provided, the
 assessors shall certify to the collecting officer the amount of taxes to
 be abated.] If there be in a city of one million population  or  more  a
 department  of  housing  preservation and development, the term "housing
 agency" shall mean only such  department  of  housing  preservation  and
 development.  [No  such  application  shall be accepted by the assessors
 unless accompanied by a certificate of the local housing agency certify-
 ing the applicant's eligibility pursuant to subdivisions two and four of
 this section.] No  [such]  certification  of  eligibility  FOR  BENEFITS
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  shall be issued by the local housing agency
 until such agency determines the initial adjusted  monthly  rent  to  be
 paid  by  tenants residing in rental dwelling units contained within the
 multiple dwelling and the comparative adjusted monthly rent  that  would
 have  to  be paid by such tenants if no tax exemption were applicable as
 provided by this section.  The initial adjusted monthly  rent  will  be
 certified  by the local housing agency as the first rent for the subject
 dwelling units. A copy of such certification with respect to such  units
 shall be attached by the applicant to the first effective lease or occu-
 pancy  agreement.  The  initial  adjusted monthly rent shall reflect the
 full tax exemption benefits as approved by the agency.
  (iv) The adjusted monthly rent per room per month shall be  multiplied
 by  the  room  count of each rental dwelling unit to provide the initial
 adjusted monthly rent for such  dwelling  unit.  The  agency  may  allow
 adjustments  in  the  initial  adjusted  monthly rent for any particular
 dwelling units provided that the total of the initial  adjusted  monthly
 rents  for all of the rental dwelling units in a multiple dwelling shall
 not exceed the total expenses of such multiple dwelling.
  The agency shall determine the estimated comparative adjusted  monthly
 rent  that  would have to be paid if no tax exemption were applicable as
 provided by this section by adding to the adjusted monthly rent for each
 dwelling unit as hereinabove computed an amount equal to (a) the differ-
 ence between the projected real property taxes which would be levied  on
 the  multiple  dwelling and the land on which it is situated at the time
 OF estimated initial occupancy if no tax abatement  were  applicable  as
 provided  by this section and the projected real property taxes hereina-
 bove utilized in connection with the computation of total expenses;  (b)
 divided  by  the room count of the building as per this section; and (c)
 multiplied by the applicants approved room count of each  such  dwelling
 unit.
  The local housing agency may promulgate rules and regulations to carry
 out the provisions of this section, not inconsistent with the provisions
 hereof,  [and  may require a reasonable filing fee in an amount provided
 by such rules and regulations] INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RULES  AND

 exceed  the  greater  of  (i)  four-tenths  of  one percent of the total

 condominium,  four-tenths  of  one  percent of the total project cost or
 four-tenths of one percent of the total project sell-out price stated in
 the last amendment to the offering  plan  accepted  for  filing  by  the
 attorney  general  of  the  state,  at the option of the applicant. Such
 total project cost or total project sell-out price shall  be  determined
 pursuant to rules promulgated by the local housing agency. Notwithstand-
 ing  the foregoing, the local housing agency may promulgate rules impos-
 ing an additional fee  if  an  application,  or  any  part  thereof,  or
 submission  in connection therewith, is defective and such defect delays
 the processing of such application or causes the local housing agency to
 expend additional resources in the processing of such application.
