 eleven  hundred ninety-two-a of this article; and having thereafter been
 requested to submit to such chemical test and having been informed, BOTH
 ORALLY AND IN WRITING IN SUCH  PERSON'S  PREFERRED  LANGUAGE,  that  the
 person's license or permit to drive and any non-resident operating priv-
 ilege  shall  be immediately suspended and subsequently revoked, or, for
 operators under the age of twenty-one  for  whom  there  are  reasonable
 grounds to believe that such operator has been operating a motor vehicle
 after  having  consumed  alcohol  in violation of section eleven hundred
 ninety-two-a of this article, shall be revoked for refusal to submit  to
 such  chemical test or any portion thereof, whether or not the person is
 found guilty of  the  charge  for  which  such  person  is  arrested  or
 detained,  refuses to submit to such chemical test or any portion there-
 of, unless a court order has been granted pursuant to subdivision  three
 of  this  section,  the  test shall not be given and a written report of
 such refusal shall be immediately made by the police officer before whom
 such refusal was made. Such report may be verified by having the  report
 sworn  to, or by affixing to such report a form notice that false state-
 ments made therein are punishable as a class A misdemeanor  pursuant  to
 section  210.45  of the penal law and such form notice together with the
 subscription of the deponent shall  constitute  a  verification  of  the
 report.
  (2)  The  report  of  the  police  officer  shall set forth reasonable
 grounds to believe such arrested person or such  detained  person  under
 the  age  of twenty-one had been driving in violation of any subdivision
 of section eleven hundred ninety-two or eleven hundred  ninety-two-a  of
 this  article,  that  said person had refused to submit to such chemical
 test AFTER BEING INFORMED BOTH ORALLY AND IN WRITING OF THE CONSEQUENCES
 OF SUCH REFUSAL, and that no chemical test was administered pursuant  to
 the  requirements of subdivision three of this section. The report shall
 be presented to the  court  upon  arraignment  of  an  arrested  person,
 provided,  however, in the case of a person under the age of twenty-one,
 for whom a test was authorized pursuant to the  provisions  of  subpara-
 graph two or three of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, and who has not
 been  placed  under  arrest  for a violation of any of the provisions of
 section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article, such report shall  be
 forwarded to the commissioner within forty-eight hours in a manner to be
 prescribed  by  the  commissioner,  and  all subsequent proceedings with
 regard to refusal to submit to such chemical test by such  person  shall
 be  as  set forth in subdivision three of section eleven hundred ninety-
 four-a of this article.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
