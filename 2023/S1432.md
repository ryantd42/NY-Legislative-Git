 will  perform work on the project, and which provides that only contrac-
 tors and subcontractors who sign a  pre-negotiated  agreement  with  the
 labor organization can perform project work.
  § 3. Notwithstanding section 103 of the general municipal law, section
 151 of the public housing law, or the provisions of any other law to the
 contrary, in conformity with the requirements of this act, and only when
 a  project  labor  agreement  is performed, the authorized authority may
 utilize the alternative delivery method referred to  as  a  design-build
 contract  for  the  project provided that each such project shall not be
 less than one million two hundred  thousand  dollars  ($1,200,000).  The
 authorized  authority  shall ensure that its procurement record reflects
 the design-build contract process authorized by this act.
  § 4. An entity selected by the authorized authority to  enter  into  a
 design-build  contract  for the project shall be selected through a two-
 step method, as follows:
  1. Step one. Generation of a list of entities that  have  demonstrated
 the  general  capability  to  perform  a  design-build  contract for the
 S. 1432  3
 
 project. Such list shall consist of a specified number of  entities,  as
 determined  by  the  authorized  authority, and shall be generated based
 upon the authorized authority's review of responses to a publicly adver-
 tised request for qualifications for the project. The authorized author-
 ity's request for qualifications for the project shall include a general
 description  of  the  project,  the  maximum  number  of  entities to be
 included on the list, and the selection criteria to be used in  generat-
 ing  the  list. Such selection criteria shall include the qualifications
 and experience of the design and construction team, organization, demon-
 strated responsibility, ability of the team or of a member or members of
 the  team  to  comply  with  applicable  requirements,  including  the
 provisions  of  articles  145,  147  and  148 of the education law, past
 record of compliance  with  the  labor  law  including  prevailing  wage
 requirements  under state and federal law; the past record of compliance
 with  existing  labor  standards  and  maintaining  harmonious  labor
 relations;  the record of protecting the health and safety of workers on
 public works projects and job sites as demonstrated  by  the  experience
 modification  rate  for  each  of  the last three years; the prospective
 bidder's ability to undertake the  particular  type  and  complexity  of
 work;  the  financial  capability, responsibility and reliability of the
 prospective bidder for such type and complexity of work; the prospective
 bidder's compliance with equal employment opportunity  requirements  and
 anti-discrimination  laws,  and  demonstrated commitment to working with
 minority and women-owned businesses through joint  ventures  or  subcon-
 tractor relationships; whether or not the prospective bidder or a person
 or entity with an interest of at least ten per centum in the prospective
 bidder,  is  listed by the federal government as excluded from receiving
 federal contracts and  certain  subcontracts,  assistance,  or  benefits
 pursuant  to  48  C.F.R.  subpart 9-4; and such other qualifications the
 authorized authority deems appropriate which may  include  but  are  not
 limited  to  project  understanding,  financial capability and record of
 past performance. The authorized authority shall evaluate and  rate  all
 entities  responding  to the request for qualifications. Based upon such
 ratings, the authorized authority shall list  the  entities  that  shall
 receive  a  request  for proposals in accordance with subdivision two of
 this section. To the extent consistent with applicable federal law,  the
 authorized authority shall consider, when awarding any contract pursuant
 to  this  section, the participation of: (a) firms certified pursuant to
 article 15-A of the executive law as minority or women-owned  businesses
 or  certified  pursuant to local law as minority or women-owned business
 enterprises and the ability of other businesses under  consideration  to
 work  with  minority  and  women-owned  businesses  so as to promote and
 assist participation by such businesses; and (b) small business concerns
 identified pursuant to subdivision (b) of section  139-g  of  the  state
 finance law.
  2.  Step two. Selection of the proposal which is the best value to the
 authorized authority.  The authorized authority shall  issue  a  request
 for  proposals for the project to the entities listed pursuant to subdi-
 vision one of this section. If such an entity  consists  of  a  team  of
 separate  entities,  the  entities that comprise such a team must remain
 unchanged from the entity as listed pursuant to subdivision one of  this
 section  unless  otherwise  approved  by the authorized authority.  The
 request for proposals for the project  shall  set  forth  the  project's
 scope  of  work, and other requirements, as determined by the authorized
 authority. The request for proposals shall set forth the  public  work's
 scope  of  work, and other requirements, as determined by the authorized
 S. 1432  4
 
 entity, which may include separate goals for work under the contract  to
 be performed by businesses certified as minority or women-owned business
 enterprises  as  defined in article 15-A of the executive law, or certi-
 fied  pursuant  to  local law as minority or women-owned business enter-
 prises. The request for proposals shall specify the criteria to be  used
 to evaluate the responses and the relative weight of each such criteria.
 Such  criteria  shall  include  the  proposal's cost, the quality of the
 proposal's solution, the qualifications and experience  of  the  design-
 build  entity,  and  other  factors  deemed  pertinent by the authorized
 authority,  which  may  include,  but  shall  not  be  limited  to,  the
 proposal's  project  implementation,  ability  to complete the work in a
 timely and satisfactory  manner,  maintenance  costs  of  the  completed
 project,  maintenance  of  traffic  approach,  and community impact. Any
 contract awarded pursuant to this act shall be awarded to  a  responsive
 and  responsible  entity  that submits the proposal, which, in consider-
 ation of these and other specified  criteria  deemed  pertinent  to  the
 project,  offers  the  best value to the authorized authority, as deter-
 mined by  the  authorized  authority.  Nothing  in  this  act  shall  be
 construed  to  prohibit  the authorized authority from negotiating final
 contract terms and conditions including cost.
  3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, when  any
 person  or  entity  is listed by the federal government as excluded from
 receiving federal contracts  and  certain  subcontracts,  assistance  or
 benefits,  pursuant to 48 C.F.R. subpart 9-4, such person or entity, and
 any firm, corporation, partnership or association in which the person or
 entity owns or controls at least ten per centum, shall be ineligible  to
 submit a bid on or be awarded any contract authorized by this act during
 such  period  of  exclusion.  The  department  of labor shall notify the
 person or entity immediately of such ineligibility and  such  person  or
 entity  must  be afforded the opportunity to appeal to the department of
 labor.
  § 5. Any contract entered into pursuant to this act  shall  include  a
 clause  requiring  that  any professional services regulated by articles
 145, 147 and 148 of the education law shall be performed and stamped and
 sealed, where appropriate, by a professional licensed in accordance with
 such articles.
  § 6. The installation, construction, demolition, reconstruction, exca-
 vation, rehabilitation, repair, and renovation of the project undertaken
 by the authorized authority pursuant to  this  act  shall  be  deemed  a
 "public work" to be performed in accordance with the provisions of arti-
 cle 8 of the labor law, as well as subject to sections 200, 240, 241 and
 242  of the labor law and enforcement of prevailing wage requirements by
 the New York state department of labor  and,  if  the  project  receives
 federal aid, applicable federal requirements for prevailing wage.
  §  7.  A  project labor agreement shall be included in the request for
 proposals for the project, provided that, based upon a study done by  or
 for  the  authorized authority, the authorized authority determines that
 its interest in obtaining the best work at the  lowest  possible  price,
 preventing  favoritism,  fraud  and corruption, and other considerations
 such as the impact of delay, the possibility of cost savings advantages,
 and any local history of labor unrest,  are  best  met  by  requiring  a
 project labor agreement.  The authorized authority  shall conduct such a
 study and the project labor agreement shall be performed consistent with
 the  provisions  of  section  222 of the labor law.  If a project labor
 agreement is not performed on the project (1) the  authorized  authority
 shall  not  utilize  a  design-build  contract  for the project; and (2)
 S. 1432  5
 
 sections 101 and 103 of the general municipal law and sections  151  and
 151-a of the public housing law shall apply to the project.
  §  8.  Each contract entered into by the authorized authority pursuant
 to this act shall comply, whenever practical, with  the  objectives  and
 goals of minority and women-owned business enterprises pursuant to arti-
 cle  15-A  of the executive law or, if the project receives federal aid,
 shall comply with  applicable  federal  requirements  for  disadvantaged
 business enterprises.
  §  9.  The  project undertaken by the authorized authority pursuant to
 this act shall be subject to the requirements of article 8 of the  envi-
 ronmental  conservation  law, and, where applicable, the requirements of
 the national environmental policy act.
  § 10. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to  the  contrary,  all
 rights  and  benefits, including terms and conditions of employment, and
 protection of civil service and  collective  bargaining  status  of  all
 employees  of  the  authorized  authority in connection with the project
 shall be preserved and protected.
  (b) Nothing in this act shall result in the: (1) displacement  of  any
 currently  employed  worker  or  loss  of  position  (including  partial
 displacement such as a reduction in  the  hours  of  non-overtime  work,
 wages  or  employment benefits), or result in the impairment of existing
 collective bargaining agreements; and (2) transfer  of  existing  duties
 and  functions related to maintenance and operations currently performed
 by existing employees of the authorized authority to a contractor.
  (c) Employees  of  the  authorized  authority  that  perform  work  in
 connection with the project serving in positions in newly created titles
 shall be assigned to the appropriate bargaining unit.
  (d)  Nothing  contained  in this act shall be construed to affect: (1)
 the existing rights and benefits of employees of the authorized authori-
 ty pursuant to an existing collective bargaining agreement and the civil
 service law, including terms  and  conditions  of  employment;  (2)  the
 existing  representational  relationships  among  employee organizations
 representing employees of the authorized authority; or (3) the  bargain-
 ing  relationships  between  the  authorized authority and such employee
 organizations.
  § 11. If otherwise applicable, the project undertaken by  the  author-
 ized  authority  pursuant  to  this act shall be governed by the general
 municipal law and/or the public housing law.
  § 12. The submission of a proposal or responses or the execution of  a
 design-build  contract pursuant to this act shall not be construed to be
 a violation of section 6512 of the education law.
  § 13. Nothing contained in this act shall limit  the  right  or  obli-
 gation  of the authorized authority to comply with the provisions of any
 existing contract, including any existing contract with or for the bene-
 fit of the holders of the obligations of the authorized authority, or to
 award contracts as otherwise provided by law.
  § 14. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire  and  be
 deemed  repealed 4 years after such date, provided that, if the New York
 city housing authority has issued requests for  qualifications  for  the
 project prior to such repeal, such project shall be permitted to contin-
 ue under this act notwithstanding such repeal.
