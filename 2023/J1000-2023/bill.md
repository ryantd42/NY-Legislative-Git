  Awareness Month in New York State
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 15 to June 15, 2023,  as  Tourette
Syndrome  Awareness  Month  in  New  York State, in conjunction with the
observance of National Tourette Syndrome Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lack of public awareness has increased  the  social  stigma
attached to Tourette Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early  diagnosis  and  treatment  of Tourette Syndrome can
prevent physical and psychological harm; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is no known cure for Tourette Syndrome and  treatment
involves  multiple  medications  and  therapies  with  costs that can be
prohibitive; and

national not-for-profit organization dedicated to identifying the cause,
finding the cure, and controlling the effects of Tourette Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tourette  Association of America (TAA) has designated
May 15 to June 15 as National Tourette  Syndrome  Awareness  Month,  the
goal  being  to  educate  the  public  about  the  nature and effects of
Tourette Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 15 to June 15, 2023,
as Tourette Syndrome Awareness Month in New York State, and to recognize
the impact  Tourette  Syndrome  can  have  on  people  living  with  the
disorder,  and the importance of an early diagnosis and proper treatment
of Tourette Syndrome; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
