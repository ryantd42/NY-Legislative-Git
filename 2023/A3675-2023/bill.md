  gages

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  2402 of the public authorities law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 18 to read as follows:

 MORTGAGE  ON  REAL  PROPERTY IMPROVED BY A RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE FOR THE
 CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH STRUCTURE.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 2405-g to read as follows:
  §  2405-G.  PURCHASE  OF CONSTRUCTION MORTGAGES.  (1) A PURPOSE OF THE

 ABLE FOR NEW RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES OR AVAILABLE FOR SUCH LOANS AT CARRY-
 ING CHARGES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL MEANS OF PERSONS AND  FAMILIES  OF  LOW

  IT  IS  HEREBY  FOUND  AND DECLARED THAT SUCH ACTIVITIES BY THE AGENCY

 PUBLIC  EMERGENCY.  IT  IS FURTHER FOUND AND DECLARED THAT SUCH PURPOSES
 ARE IN ALL RESPECTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE  STATE  OF  NEW
 YORK AND THE AGENCY SHALL BE REGARDED AS PERFORMING AN ESSENTIAL GOVERN-
 MENTAL  FUNCTION  IN  CARRYING  OUT  ITS  PURPOSES AND IN EXERCISING THE
 POWERS GRANTED BY THIS TITLE.
