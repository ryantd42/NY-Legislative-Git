 federal  social  security  act by either applying for such subsidy or by
 enrolling in a medicare savings program as a qualified medicare  benefi-
 ciary  (QMB),  a  specified low-income medicare beneficiary (SLMB), or a
 qualifying  individual  (QI),  a  program  participant  is  required  to

 ance coverage  program  to  obtain,  any  information  or  documentation
 required  to  establish  the participant's eligibility for such subsidy,

 maintain  such  enrollment.  For  unmarried participants with individual
 annual income less than or equal to twenty-three  thousand  dollars  and
 married  participants  with  joint  annual  income less than or equal to
 twenty-nine thousand  dollars,  the  [elderly]  EXPANDED  pharmaceutical
 insurance  coverage  program  shall  pay  for  the portion of the part D

 PROVIDES ENROLLEES WITH ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION PRIOR TO  THE  ANNUAL
 MEDICARE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately.
