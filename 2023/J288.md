BY: Senator HINCHEY
 
  MOURNING  the  death  of John Synan, local legend,
  distinguished citizen  and  devoted  member  of  his
  community
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of  New  York,  is  moved  this  day to pay tribute to an eminent man of
indomitable faith and  dedication  whose  steadfast  commitment  to  his
community  and  undying  love  for  his neighbor will forever stand as a
paradigm and inspiration for others; and
 
  WHEREAS, The unity of  our  State  and  Nation  is  built  upon  the
compassion  of  individuals  such as John Synan who upheld the values of
community life and who, through their great actions, epitomized the best
of humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS, John Synan, affectionately  known  throughout  his  beloved
Town  of Woodstock, New York, as Jogger John, died on Saturday, November
26, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, John Joseph Synan was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised
in Amityville, Long Island to a large family  with  eight  brothers  and
sisters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An ace in school with a genius-level IQ, John Synan became
a technical illustrator for NASA,  inking  the  drawings  of  the  lunar
module before proudly serving as a member of the United States Air Force
during the Vietnam era; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  his  honorable  discharge,  John  Synan  came to the
Woodstock Festival in 1969, visited the town,  and  returned  again  and
again, eventually making Woodstock his permanent home after riding north
from New York City on a bicycle; and
 
  WHERERAS,  A  true local legend who made his rounds daily through town
doing odd jobs for his adored fellow Woodstockers, John Synan  could  be
seen  daily  jogging  the  area's roads, trails and hills, a free spirit
roaming in his own unique world without boundaries; and
 
  WHEREAS, In a documentary by Kaleigh Griffin,  "First  Name:  Jogger
Last  Name:  John,"  the  remarkable  life of this extraordinary man was
poignantly captured over a three month period before it was screened  at
the  2013  Woodstock  Film  Festival  where  John  Synan  received  a
well-deserved standing ovation from his hometown crowd; and
 
  WHEREAS, A sweet, gentle and profound man who was sincerely loved by
all, the passing of John  Synan  marks  the  end  of  the  greatest  era
Woodstock, New York, has and will ever know; and
 
  WHEREAS,  John Synan's infinite selflessness and magical spirit will
shine  on  through  the  vivid  and  happy  memories  he  has  instilled
throughout  the  community  he  so much adored; his insight and strength
will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope to the  countless
lives he touched; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, John Synan leaves behind a legacy which will long endure the
passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all  who  were
privileged  to  have  known  and  loved  such an amazing man; he will be
deeply missed and truly merits the grateful tribute of this  Legislative
Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death of John Synan, and to express its deepest condolences to
his family, friends and the Woodstock community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of John Synan.
