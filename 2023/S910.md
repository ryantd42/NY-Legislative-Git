  Section  1.  Section  22.09  of  the mental hygiene law, as amended by
 section 1 of part D of chapter 69 of the laws of 2016,  paragraph  5  of
 subdivision  (a) as amended by section 9 of part AA of chapter 57 of the

 § 22.09 Emergency services for persons intoxicated, impaired,  or  inca-
  pacitated by alcohol [and/or substances].
  (a) As used in this article:
  1.  "Intoxicated  or  impaired  person" means a person whose mental or
 physical functioning is substantially impaired as a result of the  pres-
 ence of alcohol [and/or substances] in his or her body.
  2.  "Incapacitated"  means  that  a  person, as a result of the use of
 alcohol [and/or substances], is unconscious or has his or  her  judgment

 confirming that the person is, and continues  to  be,  incapacitated  by
 alcohol  [and/or substances] to the degree that there is a likelihood to
 result in harm to the person or others.
  5. "Treatment facility" means a facility designated by the commission-
 er which may only include a general hospital as defined in article twen-
 ty-eight  of  the public health law, or a medically managed or medically
 supervised withdrawal, inpatient rehabilitation, or residential stabili-
 zation treatment program that has been certified by the commissioner  to
 have appropriate medical staff available on-site at all times to provide
 emergency  services  and continued evaluation of capacity of individuals
 retained under this section or a crisis  stabilization  center  licensed
 pursuant to [article] SECTION 36.01 of this chapter.
  (b)  1.  An  intoxicated  or  impaired person may come voluntarily for
 emergency services to a chemical dependence program or treatment facili-
 ty authorized by the commissioner to provide such emergency services.  A
 person who appears to be intoxicated or impaired and who consents to the
 proffered  help  may be assisted by any peace officer acting pursuant to
 his or her special duties, police officer,  or  by  a  designee  of  the
 director of community services to return to his or her home, to a chemi-
 cal  dependence  program or treatment facility, or to any other facility
 authorized by the commissioner to provide such  emergency  services.  In
 such cases, the peace officer, police officer, or designee of the direc-
 tor  of  community  services shall accompany the intoxicated or impaired
 person in a manner which is reasonably designed to  assure  his  or  her
 safety,  as  set  forth  in  regulations  promulgated in accordance with
 subdivision (d) of this section.
  2. A person  who  appears  to  be  incapacitated  by  alcohol  [and/or
 substances]  to  the degree that there is a likelihood to result in harm
 to the person or to others may be taken by a peace officer acting pursu-
 ant to his or her special duties, or a police officer who is a member of
 the state police or of an authorized police department or force or of  a
 sheriff's  department  or  by  the  director  of community services or a
 person duly designated by  him  or  her  to  a  treatment  facility  for
 purposes  of receiving emergency services. Every reasonable effort shall
 be made to protect the health and safety of such person,  including  but
 not  limited  to the requirement that the peace officer, police officer,
 or director of community services or his or her designee shall accompany
 the apparently incapacitated person in  a  manner  which  is  reasonably
 designed  to  assure  his  or  her  safety,  as set forth in regulations
 promulgated in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section.
  3. A person who comes voluntarily or is brought  without  his  or  her
 objection to any such facility or program in accordance with this subdi-
 vision  shall  be  given  emergency  care and treatment at such place if
 found suitable therefor by authorized personnel, or referred to  another
 suitable  facility  or treatment program for care and treatment, or sent
 to his or her home.
  4. The director of a treatment facility may receive as  a  patient  in
 need of emergency services any person who appears to be incapacitated as
 defined in this section.
  5.  A  person  who  comes  voluntarily  or  is brought with his or her
 objection to a treatment facility shall be examined as soon as  possible
 but not more than twelve hours after arriving at such treatment facility
 by  an  examining physician. If such examining physician determines that
 such person is incapacitated  by  alcohol  [and/or  substances]  to  the
 degree  that  there  is  a likelihood to result in harm to the person or
 others, he or she may be retained  to  receive  emergency  services  and
 S. 910  3
 
 shall  be regularly reevaluated to confirm continued incapacity by alco-
 hol [and/or substances] to the degree that  there  is  a  likelihood  to
 result  in  harm  to  the  person  or others. If the examining physician
 determines  at any time that such person is not incapacitated by alcohol
 [and/or substances] to the degree that there is a likelihood  to  result
 in  harm  to  the person or others, he or she must be released. Notwith-
 standing any other law, in no event may such person be retained  against
 his  or  her objection beyond whichever is the shorter of the following:
 (i) the time that he or  she  is  no  longer  incapacitated  by  alcohol
 [and/or  substances]  to the degree that there is a likelihood to result
 in harm to the person or others or (ii) a period longer than seventy-two
 hours.
  6. Every reasonable effort must be made to obtain the person's consent
 to give prompt notification of a person's retention  in  a  facility  or
 program  pursuant  to  this  section  to  his or her closest relative or
 friend, and, if requested by such person, to his  or  her  attorney  and
 personal  physician,  in  accordance  with federal confidentiality regu-
 lations.
  7. A person may not be retained pursuant  to  this  section  beyond  a
 period of seventy-two hours without his or her consent. Persons suitable
 therefor may be voluntarily admitted to a chemical dependence program or
 facility pursuant to this article.
  (c)  Discharge  procedures.  1.  The discharge procedure process shall
 begin as soon as the patient is admitted to the treatment  facility  and
 shall  be  considered  a  part  of  the  treatment planning process. The
 discharge plan shall be developed in collaboration with the patient  and
 any  significant other(s) the patient chooses to involve. If the patient
 is a minor, the discharge plan must also be  developed  in  consultation
 with  his  or  her parent or guardian, unless the minor is being treated
 without parental consent as authorized by section 22.11 of  this  [chap-
 ter] ARTICLE.
  2.  No  patient shall be discharged without a discharge plan which has
 been completed and reviewed by the multi-disciplinary team prior to  the
 discharge of the patient. This review may be part of a regular treatment
 plan review. The portion of the discharge plan which includes the refer-
 rals  for  continuing care shall be given to the patient upon discharge.
 This requirement shall not apply to patients who refuse continuing  care
 planning,  provided,  however,  that  the  treatment facility shall make
 reasonable efforts to provide information about the dangers of long term
 substance use as well as information related to treatment including, but
 not limited to, the OASAS HOPELINE and the OASAS Bed Availability  Dash-
 board.
  3.  The  discharge plan shall be developed by the responsible clinical
 staff member, who, in the development of such plan, shall  consider  the
 patient's self-reported confidence in maintaining abstinence and follow-
 ing  an individualized relapse prevention plan. The responsible clinical
 staff member shall also consider an assessment of the patient's home and
 family environment, vocational/educational/employment  status,  and  the
 patient's  relationships  with  significant  others.  The purpose of the
 discharge plan shall be to establish the level of  clinical  and  social
 resources  available  to  the  patient upon discharge from the inpatient
 service and the need for the  services  for  significant  others.  The
 discharge plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (i)  identification of continuing chemical dependence services includ-
 ing management of withdrawal or continuing stabilization and  any  other
 S. 910  4
 
 treatment,  rehabilitation,  self-help  and  vocational, educational and
 employment services the patient will need after discharge;
  (ii) identification of the type of residence, if any, that the patient
 will need after discharge;
  (iii)  identification  of specific providers of these needed services;
 and
  (iv) specific referrals and  initial  appointments  for  these  needed
 services.
  4.  A  discharge summary which includes the course and results of care
 and treatment must be prepared  and  included  in  each  patient's  case
 record within twenty days of discharge.
  (d) The commissioner shall promulgate all rules and regulations, after
 consulting with representatives of appropriate law enforcement and chem-
 ical  dependence  providers  of  services,  establishing  procedures for
 taking intoxicated or impaired persons and persons apparently  incapaci-
 tated by alcohol [and/or substances] to their residences or to appropri-
 ate public or private facilities for emergency services and for minimiz-
 ing  the  role  of  the  police  in  obtaining treatment of such persons
 necessary to implement the provisions of this section, including but not
 limited  to  establishing  procedures  for  transporting  incapacitated
 persons to a treatment facility for emergency services.
