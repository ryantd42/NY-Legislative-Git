  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 28, 2023, as Menstrual Hygiene Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days of the year that are set aside to  increase  awareness  of
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2023, as Menstrual
Hygiene Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of World Menstrual Hygiene Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Millions  of women, girls, and other people who menstruate
are stigmatized, excluded, and discriminated against simply because they
menstruate; and
 
  WHEREAS, Menstruation is  a  natural  bodily  function  that  women,
girls,  and  people who menstruate experience once per month for decades
of their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to a study by the American College of  Obstetrics
and Gynecology, sixty-four percent of women, girls, and other people who
menstruate  report  experiencing  difficulty affording menstrual hygiene
products such as pads, tampons, or reusable products like menstrual cups
each month; and
 
  WHEREAS, This lack of menstrual hygiene products,  known  as  period
poverty, can adversely affect an individual's health and well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  in five women, girls, and other people who menstruate
report missing work or school as a result of period poverty; and
 
  WHEREAS, Period poverty exacerbates the  vicious  cycle  of  forcing
women, girls, and other people who menstruate from getting an education,
earning an income, and fully and equally participating in everyday life;
and
 
  WHEREAS, People experiencing period poverty risk infections by using
proxy  products, such as socks or toilet paper, or not changing products
as often as medically advised; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Encouraging  the  observance  of  Menstrual  Hygiene  Day
promotes gender equity and equality for all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to raise awareness
and  change  the  negative  social  norms  surrounding menstrual hygiene
across New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2023, as Menstrual
Hygiene Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  United  Way of the Greater Capital Region's affinity group, Women
United; and Capital Region Menstrual Health Coalition.
