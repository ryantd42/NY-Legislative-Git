 AN ACT in relation to granting Tier IV status in the New York state  and
  local employees' retirement system to Vincent Stark
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Vincent Stark, an employee of  the  Albany  County  District  Attorney's
 Office  and  a member of the New York state and local employees' retire-
 ment system, who was employed as an  intern  with  the  New  York  State
 Assembly  from  January  3, 2005 until July 1, 2005, who for reasons not
 ascribable to his own negligence, failed to  become  a  member  of  such
 retirement  system during such employment with the New York State Assem-
 bly in 2005, shall be deemed to have joined the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system on the date January 3, 2005  and  shall  be
 granted Tier IV status in such retirement system, if, within one year of
 the effective date of this act, he shall file a written request with the
 state comptroller.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system by Vincent Stark shall be returned or refunded to  him
 pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the state of New York.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would grant retroactive Tier 4 status in the New York State
 and Local Employees' Retirement System to Vincent Stark, a current  Tier
 5  member  employed  by the Albany County District Attorney's Office, by
 changing their date of membership to January 3, 2005. There will  be  no
 refund of member contributions.

  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $2,400 in the
 annual contributions of the County of Albany for the fiscal year  ending
 March  31,  2024.  In  future  years, this cost will vary as the billing
 rates and salary of Vincent Stark change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $55,600 which will be
 borne by the State of New York as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
