  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 8, 2023, as War on Poverty Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body hereby  memorializes  Governor  Kathy
Hochul  to  proclaim January 8, 2023, as War on Poverty Day in the State
of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, War on  Poverty  Day  is  an  unofficial  holiday  observed
annually  on  January  8th  to  reflect  on  the  impact of the Economic
Opportunity Act and several other policies first introduced in 1964  and
enacted  as President Lyndon B. Johnson's response to the rising poverty
level in the country at the time; and
 
  WHEREAS, One definition of poverty is "not having  enough  resources
for  your  basic  needs," and it has a huge impact on people's lives and
society; and
 
  WHEREAS, "War on Poverty" generally refers  to  several  initiatives
proposed  by Johnson's administration and passed by Congress as a way to
expand economic opportunity through anti-poverty, health, education, and
employment policy implementation; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the words of former President Lyndon B.  Johnson  during
his  State  of  the  Union  address, "Our aim is not only to relieve the
symptoms of poverty, but to cure it and, above  all,  to  prevent  it.";
this  initiative  is  said  to  have  been influenced by the 1962 expose
titled "The Other America," which demonstrated that poverty  in  America
was far more prevalent than commonly assumed; and
 
  WHEREAS, President Johnson's declaration was the precedent of War on
Poverty  Day;  furthermore, it was a vital component in congress passing
the bipartisan Economic Opportunity Act  of  1964,  and  the  even  more
important  Civil  Rights  legislation  which  created  the  legislative
framework that set the foundations for some of America's current  social
welfare programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout President Johnson's administrations, the War on
Poverty  laid  the  foundation  for  America's  present-day  safety  net
programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
or food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid, and many others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Poverty does not discriminate, and it can happen to anyone;
therefore,  celebrating  War on Poverty Day serves to recommit us all to
the eradication of poverty; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  serious  issue,  and more must be done to increase activity at the
 
local, State and national levels to stamp out poverty;  now,  therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 8, 2023, as War on
Poverty Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
