  Section 1. The real property tax  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 458-d to read as follows:
  §  458-D. RESERVIST EXEMPTION. 1. THE FOLLOWING TERMS WHENEVER USED OR
 REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS  UNLESS  A
 DIFFERENT MEANING CLEARLY APPEARS IN THE CONTEXT:

 ORDERED TO ACTIVE DUTY, OF THE  FEDERAL  RESERVE  FORCE  OF  THE  UNITED
 STATES MILITARY.
  (B) "PERIOD OF WAR" MEANS THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR; THE MEXICAN BORDER

 THE ACTIVE MILITARY, NAVAL OR AIR SERVICE.
  (D) "QUALIFIED OWNER" MEANS A RESERVIST, THE SPOUSE OF A RESERVIST  OR
 THE UNREMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE OF A RESERVIST. WHERE PROPERTY IS OWNED
 BY  MORE  THAN ONE QUALIFIED OWNER, THE EXEMPTION TO WHICH EACH IS ENTI-
 TLED MAY BE COMBINED. WHERE A RESERVIST IS ALSO THE UNREMARRIED  SURVIV-

 PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT IN THE EVENT ANY PORTION OF SUCH PROPERTY IS  NOT
 SO  USED  EXCLUSIVELY  FOR  RESIDENTIAL  PURPOSES  BUT IS USED FOR OTHER
 PURPOSES, SUCH PORTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION  AND  THE  REMAINING
 PORTION  ONLY  SHALL  BE  ENTITLED  TO  THE  EXEMPTION  PROVIDED BY THIS
 SECTION. SUCH PROPERTY MUST BE THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF THE RESERVIST OR
 UNREMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE OF THE RESERVIST, UNLESS THE  RESERVIST  OR
 UNREMARRIED  SURVIVING SPOUSE IS ABSENT FROM THE PROPERTY DUE TO MEDICAL
 REASONS OR INSTITUTIONALIZATION. IN THE EVENT  THE  RESERVIST  DIES  AND
 THERE  IS  NO UNREMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE, "QUALIFYING RESIDENTIAL REAL
 PROPERTY" SHALL MEAN THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OWNED BY  A  QUALIFIED  OWNER
 PRIOR  TO  DEATH, PROVIDED THAT THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTY BECOMES VESTED

 THE STATE EQUALIZATION RATE EXCEEDS ONE HUNDRED, THEN THE  STATE  EQUAL-
 IZATION  RATE  SHALL  BE  ONE  HUNDRED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
 WHERE A SPECIAL EQUALIZATION RATE IS ESTABLISHED FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 SECTION, THE ASSESSOR IS DIRECTED AND AUTHORIZED TO RECOMPUTE THE RESER-
 VIST EXEMPTION ON THE ASSESSMENT ROLL BY APPLYING SUCH SPECIAL EQUALIZA-
 TION  RATE  INSTEAD OF THE LATEST STATE EQUALIZATION RATE APPLIED IN THE

 ROLL,  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  FACT  THAT  SUCH  ASSESSOR  MAY RECEIVE THE
 SPECIAL EQUALIZATION RATE AFTER THE COMPLETION, VERIFICATION AND  FILING

 HAVE CUSTODY OF THE ROLL WHEN SUCH RECOMPUTATION  IS  ACCOMPLISHED,  THE
 ASSESSOR  SHALL  CERTIFY SUCH RECOMPUTATION TO THE LOCAL OFFICERS HAVING
 CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF SUCH ROLL, AND SUCH  LOCAL  OFFICERS  ARE  HEREBY
