 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Ruth AME Zion Church to file  with
  the  town of Brookhaven assessor an application for certain real prop-
  erty tax exemptions

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the  town of Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, is hereby
 authorized to accept from the Ruth AME Zion Church  an  application  for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real
 property  tax  law for the 2020 assessment roll, for the parcel owned by
 such organization located at 105 Station Road in Bellport, in  the  town
 of  Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk county tax
 map number 0202-002.00-02.00-011.001. If accepted, the application shall
 be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the  taxable  status
 date established for such rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  town  board  of  Brookhaven,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject rolls, the town board of Brookhaven may, in its sole discretion,
 provide  for  the  refund  of  those  taxes paid and cancel those taxes,
 fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
