  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Section 423 of the retirement and social security  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  770  of  the  laws  of 1970, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 423. Investments.  1. a. On and after April first, nineteen  hundred
 sixty-seven,  the  comptroller  shall invest the available monies of the
 common retirement fund in any investments and securities  authorized  by
 law  for  each  retirement system and shall hold such investments in his
 name as trustee of such fund, notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
 this chapter. Participating interests in such investments shall be cred-
 ited  to  each retirement system in the manner and at the time specified
 in [paragraph] SUBDIVISION two of section  four  hundred  twenty-two  of
 this article.
  b.  To assist in the management of the monies of the common retirement
 fund, the comptroller shall appoint  an  investment  advisory  committee
 consisting  of  not less than seven members who shall serve for his term
 of office. A vacancy occurring from any cause other than  expiration  of
 term  shall  be filled by the comptroller for the remainder of the term.
 Each member of the committee  shall  be  experienced  in  the  field  of
 investments  and  shall  have  served,  or shall be serving, as a senior
 officer or member of the board of an insurance company,  banking  corpo-
 ration  or  other  financial or investment organization authorized to do

 portfolio  of  the  fund  and make such recommendations as may be deemed
 necessary.
  2.  The comptroller shall appoint a separate mortgage advisory commit-
 tee, with the advice and consent of the investment  advisory  committee,
 to  review  proposed  mortgage and real estate investments by the common
 retirement fund. In making investments, as authorized by law, the  comp-
 troller  shall  be guided by policies established by each committee from
 time to time; and, in the event the mortgage advisory  committee  disap-
 proves  a proposed mortgage or real estate investment, such shall not be
 made.
  3. No officer or employee of any state department or agency  shall  be
 eligible  for  membership  on  either  committee.  Each  committee shall
 convene periodically on call of the  comptroller,  or  on  call  of  the
 chairman.  The members of each committee shall be entitled to reimburse-
 ment for their actual  and  necessary  expenses  but  shall  receive  no
 compensation for their services.
  4.  A.  ANY  INVESTMENT  MANAGER  ON CONTRACT WITH THE OFFICE OF STATE
 COMPTROLLER TO MAKE INVESTMENT CONTRACTS FOR THE OFFICE OF  STATE  COMP-
 TROLLER  DIVISION  OF PENSIONS, INVESTMENT, AND CASH MANAGEMENT SHALL BE
 DISCLOSED TO ANY ENROLLEE OF THE NEW YORK STATE COMMON  RETIREMENT  FUND
 UPON REQUEST.
  B.  THE CONTENTS OF INVESTMENT CONTRACTS FOR THE OFFICE OF STATE COMP-
 TROLLER DIVISION OF PENSIONS, INVESTMENT, AND CASH  MANAGEMENT  AND  THE
 CONTENTS OF OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENT CONTRACTS SHALL BE DISCLOSED TO ANY
 ENROLLEE OF THE NEW YORK STATE COMMON RETIREMENT FUND UPON REQUEST.
  C.  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  THE TERM "OPPORTUNISTIC
 INVESTMENT" SHALL MEAN ANY ONE-OFF INVESTMENT  THAT  IS  BROUGHT  BY  AN
 INVESTMENT  MANAGER  AND  CAN  ONLY  BE  SOURCED THROUGH SUCH INVESTMENT
 MANAGER AND SHALL INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS,  HEDGE  FUNDS  AND  REAL
 ESTATE  FUNDS.  SUCH  INVESTMENTS  MAY  BE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR A SET TIME
 PERIOD DETERMINED BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER AND  AT  A  SET  PRICE  ALSO
 DETERMINED BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER. OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS MAY ALSO
 INCLUDE PUBLIC MARKET PRODUCTS AND NICHE STRATEGIES.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
