  HONORING  Ex-Chief John Bruckner upon the occasion
  of his designation for special recognition after  45
  years  of  dedicated  service to the Oyster Bay Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  Firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  Ex-Chief
John  Bruckner  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 45 years of dedicated service to the Oyster  Bay  Fire
Department  to  be  celebrated  at  its  Annual  Installation  Dinner at
Crescent Beach Club in Bayville, New York, on Friday,  April  21,  2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
John Bruckner is one such firefighter; throughout 45  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Ex-Chief John Bruckner upon the occasion of  his  designation  for
special  recognition  after  45 years of dedicated service to the Oyster
Bay Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Ex-Chief John Bruckner.
