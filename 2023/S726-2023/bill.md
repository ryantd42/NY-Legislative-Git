 Introduced  by Sens. SERRANO, HOYLMAN, KRUEGER, PARKER -- read twice and
  ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on
  Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation
 
 AN  ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, in
  relation to providing for a review process of  proposals  to  alienate
  municipal parkland
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The parks, recreation  and  historic  preservation  law  is
 amended by adding a new article 16 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 16
  MUNICIPAL PARKLAND ALIENATION
 SECTION 16.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
  16.03 DEFINITIONS.
  16.05 MUNICIPAL PARKLAND ALIENATION.
  16.07 PARKLAND ALIENATION PROPOSAL REVIEW.
  16.09 PARKLAND ALIENATION REPORTING.
  16.11 PARKLAND ALIENATION ENFORCEMENT.
  16.13 STATE AUDITS.
  16.15 PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE NOT AFFECTED.
  § 16.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THAT
 MUNICIPALLY OWNED PARKLAND ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF LIFE, COMMUNITY CHAR-
 ACTER,  AND  ECONOMIC VITALITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDES HEALTHY
 AND AFFORDABLE RECREATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES  TO  NEW  YORK
 STATE  RESIDENTS  AND VISITORS.  ONCE LOST, MUNICIPAL PARKLAND IS DIFFI-
 CULT TO RECOVER.  ACCORDINGLY,  THE  DISCONTINUATION  OR  ALIENATION  OF
 MUNICIPAL  PARKLAND SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY REPLACEMENT WITH COMPARABLE
 PARKLAND TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY AND RESIDENTS OF THE STATE.
  NEW YORK STATE COURTS  HAVE  LONG  HELD  THAT  MUNICIPAL  PARKLAND  IS
 SUBJECT TO A "PUBLIC TRUST" FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. FOR MORE THAN
 A CENTURY, NEW YORK STATE COURTS HAVE UPHELD THE REQUIREMENT THAT MUNIC-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 IS HEREBY DECLARED TO BE THE PUBLIC POLICY AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF
 THIS STATE TO PROVIDE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM  ADMINISTERED  BY  THE
 OFFICE  TO  REVIEW  PROPOSALS TO ALIENATE MUNICIPAL PARKLAND IN ORDER TO
 PROMOTE THE USE, PROTECTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF MUNICIPAL  PARKLAND  FOR
