 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  MEEKS,  GONZALEZ-ROJAS,  EPSTEIN, GALLAGHER,
  BURDICK, JACKSON -- read once and referred to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal law, the criminal procedure law and the gener-
  al  business  law,  in  relation  to  decriminalizing  possession  of
  controlled  substances; to amend the public health law, in relation to
  establishing the drug decriminalization task force; to repeal  certain
  provisions  of  the  penal  law related thereto; and providing for the
  repeal of certain provisions upon the expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The legislature hereby finds that
 substance use disorder is a disease  and  should  therefore  be  treated
 using  a  public  health,  rather  than a criminal-legal-system-centered
 approach.  Existing laws criminalizing the possession of drugs have been
 ineffective in reducing drug use and preventing substance use  disorder.
 Instead,  these laws have devastated individuals, families, and communi-
 ties.  Treating substance use as a crime by arresting and  incarcerating
 people  for personal use offenses causes significant harm to individuals
 who use drugs by disrupting and further destabilizing  their  lives.  It
 also contributes to an increased risk of death, the spread of infectious
 diseases,  mass  incarceration, the separation of families, and barriers
 to accessing housing, employment, and other vital services. Furthermore,
 even though research shows that drugs  are  used  and  sold  at  similar
 levels  across  all  races,  laws  criminalizing  the  use of drugs have
 disproportionately impacted Black and Latinx communities. The purpose of
 this legislation is to save lives  and  to  help  transform  New  York's
 approach to drug use from one based on criminalization and stigma to one
 based  on  science  and  compassion,  by  eliminating criminal and civil
 penalties for the personal possession of controlled substances.

 paragraph (k) OR SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF PARAGRAPH (M) of subdivision  three
 of  section  160.50  of this part, in which case the court shall presume
 that a conviction by plea for the aforementioned offenses was not  know-
 ing,  voluntary and intelligent if it has [severe or] ongoing COLLATERAL
 consequences, including but not limited to  potential  or  actual  immi-
 gration consequences, and shall presume that a conviction by verdict for
