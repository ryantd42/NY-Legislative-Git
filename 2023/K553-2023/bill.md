BY: M. of A. Manktelow
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 21, 2023, as Pets for Veterans  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  appreciate  the  service,
companionship,  loyalty,  and medical benefits therapeutic animals bring
to the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 21, 2023, as  Pets
for  Veterans  Day  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Pets for Veterans Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that one  in  five  veterans  suffers  from
PTSD;  the  disorder  manifests  itself  with  anxiety,  depression  or
insomnia, as well as flashbacks from their time in service; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Pets for Veterans Day was created to recognize all
of  the  exceptional  therapy  animals  who  partner  with  their  human
companions  to  bring  comfort and healing to those in need, and to help
spread  awareness  about  veterans'  emotional  needs  and  help  them
transition  back  to  civilian  life  or  continue  to  live  a fruitful
post-service life; and
 
  WHEREAS, The primary purpose of these therapy animals is to  provide
veterans with significant reductions in pain and emotional distress, and
to  give family members and friends of those veterans a sense of comfort
and well-being; these kind and  compassionate  animals  are  most  often
privately owned and tend to visit VA facilities on a regular basis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  many  of  these  visits, veterans would ask if they
could take the therapy dog home  with  them,  leading  their  owners  to
realize that 24/7 companionship would be better for many veterans than a
one-hour therapy visit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pets for Vets was founded on October 21, 2009, by Clarissa
Black, an animal behaviorist and trainer who hoped to help veterans with
issues related to  their  service;  the  organizational  goal  uses  the
principles of animal-assisted therapy and how it can positively affect a
veteran's quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pets  for  Vets diligently works to help connect and match
veterans with pets, whether it be an older veteran or  one  who  suffers
from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There are many benefits to owning a dog; being a pet owner
promotes responsibility and routine, and encourages  outdoor  activities
and sun exposure, both known to uplift mood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  friendship  and  love  of  a  pet  can also alleviate
loneliness, stress, anxiety, and reduces  blood  pressure,  cholesterol,
 
and  triglycerides;  these  positive impacts go beyond the emotional and
psychological, they can also be physiological, helping improve the way a
person functions in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Not  only  does the pairing of a dog help the veteran, but
also saves the lives of so many overlooked shelter animals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through  the  concerned  and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of  the  community and its citizenry and through the love of a friendly,
patient, confident, and gentle dog, our  veterans  are  given  a  second
chance at a better life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
extraordinary  therapy  animals  and  their  handlers  who  demonstrate
tremendous care and compassion by bringing comfort and healing to  those
veterans in need; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 21, 2023, as  Pets
for Veterans Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
