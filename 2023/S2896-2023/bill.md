  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph (a) of subdivision 5 of
 section 489-cccccc of the real property tax law, as amended  by  chapter
 397 of the laws of 2017, is amended to read as follows:

 building  permit for construction work, or, where construction work does
 not require a building permit, no later than one year from the  date  of
 commencement  of  construction.  Abatement benefits shall not be granted
 until the applicant files the final application. If the  final  applica-
 tion  is not filed within such one year period, abatement benefits shall
 not be granted until such application is filed, and the  department  may
 delay  the granting of such benefits, at the department's discretion, to
 investigate the reason for the late filing. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL  ACCEPT
 APPLICATIONS  FROM  APPLICANTS WHO (A) AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF LOCAL
