 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to the residen-
  tial parking system in the town of Harrison
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 a lack of parking for residents of certain areas of the town of Harrison
 has resulted in traffic hazards, congestion and air and noise pollution.
 In  addition, such lack of parking poses a hazard to residents and other
 pedestrians in such area.
  The legislature further finds that a residential parking  system  will
 reduce such hazards and will reduce pollution levels as well. The legis-
 lature,  therefore, hereby declares the necessity of this act to author-
 ize the town of Harrison  to  adopt  a  residential  parking  system  in
 accordance with the provisions of this act.
  §  2.  Subdivision 2 of section 1662-c of the vehicle and traffic law,
 as added by chapter 265 of the laws of  1998,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
