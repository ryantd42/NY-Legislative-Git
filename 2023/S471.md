 of  such  burial  does  not  exceed  the amount fixed by the appropriate
 public welfare official or the  local  appropriating  body  for  similar
 burials in similar circumstances, such public welfare official may:
  (1)  if  such relatives or friends were required to pay the expense of
 such burial in order to arrange the same,  wholly  or  partly  reimburse
 them,  from assets transferred or assigned to such social services offi-
 cial by or on behalf of the deceased recipient; but he shall  not  reim-
 burse a legally responsible relative of the deceased for any part of the
 amount  paid  by him which in the judgment of such social services offi-

  (2)  pay part of the expense of such burial, if, and to the extent and
 under the circumstances, permitted by his local policy, which shall  not
 be  inconsistent  with  this chapter, and the regulations of the depart-
 ment; but in no case shall such social services official pay  more  than
 the  balance remaining to be paid after the total of the amounts paid or
 to be paid by all other sources, including payments made or to  be  made
 by  such  legally  responsible  relatives  of the deceased as are in the
 judgment of such official able to bear the  same,  is  credited  to  and
