  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision 1 of section 1199-gggg of the public authori-

 of  any project or for any other corporate purpose, including the estab-

 gations  may  be  greater  than  [forty-two]  SEVENTY  million  dollars
 [($42,000,000)] ($70,000,000) only if the present value of the aggregate
 debt  service  of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obli-

 obligations so refunded or repaid, shall be calculated by utilizing  the
 effective  interest  rate  of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or
 other obligations, which shall be that rate arrived at by  doubling  the
 semi-annual  interest  rate  (compounded  semi-annually)  necessary  to
 discount the debt service payments on the refunding or repayment  bonds,
 notes or other obligations from the payment dates thereof to the date of
 issue  of  the  refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations
 and to the price bid including estimated accrued  interest  or  proceeds
 received  by the authority including estimated accrued interest from the
 sale thereof. The authority shall have the power and is  hereby  author-
 ized  to  enter  into  such  agreements  and perform such acts as may be
 required under any applicable federal legislation to  secure  a  federal
 guarantee of any bonds.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
