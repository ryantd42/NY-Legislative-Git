 AN ACT authorizing New York Kali Mandir,  Inc.  to  receive  retroactive
  real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 New York Kali Mandir, Inc. an application for exemption from real  prop-
 erty  taxes  pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax law with
 respect to the 2020-2021 assessment roll, for  a  portion  of  the  2020
 general  tax  year,  a portion of the 2020-2021 school tax year, and for
 all the 2021 general tax year for the parcel conveyed to such  organiza-
 tion, with such parcel being located at 600 Seaman Avenue, in the hamlet
 of  Baldwin,  town  of  Hempstead,  county of Nassau, otherwise known as
 Nassau county parcel ID section 54 block 018 lot 0055. If accepted,  the
 application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been received on or before
 the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
