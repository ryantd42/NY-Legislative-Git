  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  the  month  of  May  2023,  as  Williams  Syndrome
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  of  2023,  as  Williams  Syndrome
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Williams  Syndrome  (WS) is a genetic condition present at
birth that can affect anyone and is  characterized  by  medical  issues,
including  cardiovascular  disease,  developmental  delays, and learning
disabilities; these medical conditions often occur  side  by  side  with
striking  verbal  abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity
for music; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that Williams Syndrome impacts one in every
10,000 people worldwide, including as  many  as  30,000  in  the  United
States;  it  is  known to occur equally in both males and females and in
every culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, As children with Williams Syndrome grow, many struggle with
things like spatial relations, numbers, and  abstract  reasoning,  which
can make daily tasks a challenge; and
 
  WHEREAS, In adulthood, individuals with Williams Syndrome will often
need  supportive  housing  and  other  resources  to reach their fullest
potential; with these supports, they can  contribute  greatly  to  their
communities as volunteers or paid employees in a wide variety of fields;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1982, The Williams Syndrome Association provides
support  to  individuals  with  Williams  Syndrome,  as  well  as  their
families, connecting them with professionals and others who  can  assist
them in coping with the condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  this  organization's efforts, from raising public
awareness, to funding critical  new  research,  and  providing  valuable
information  and  support to families, The Williams Syndrome Association
has improved the quality of  life  and  futures  of  those  affected  by
Williams Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Williams Syndrome Association, along with the families
and friends of those with Williams Syndrome, are  to  be  commended  for
their  hard  work,  compassion,  and dedication to educating the country
about this rare disorder; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May of 2023, as Williams
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
