 AN ACT authorizing the county of Rockland assessor to accept an applica-

  Immaculate Inc.
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the county of Rockland is hereby authorized to accept
 from Sister Servants  of  Mary  Immaculate  Inc.  an  application  for
 exemption  from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a and 462 of
 the real property tax law with respect to the 2022-2023 assessment rolls
 for all of the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school taxes and all of the 2022,
 2023 and 2024 general taxes for the parcel owned  by  such  organization
 located at 92 Eagle Valley Road, town of Sloatsburg, county of Rockland,
 otherwise  known  as  Nassau  county tax map section 38.41, block 1, lot
 1-3. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if  it  had  been
 received  on  or  before  the  taxable  status date established for such
 assessment roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Rockland  county  legislature,  may  make appropriate
 correction to the subject roll. If such exemption is  granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject roll, the applicable governing body or tax  department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
