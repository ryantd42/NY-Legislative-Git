 Introduced  by M. of A. SIMON -- read once and referred to the Committee

 AN ACT to direct the office of general services to conduct a feasibility
  study on installing solar panels on all  public  buildings  under  the
  jurisdiction  of the office of general services; and providing for the
  repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  office of general services, in consultation with the
 department of environmental  conservation,  shall  study  the  cost  and
 viability  of  installing solar panels on all public buildings under the
 jurisdiction of the office of general services. Such  study  shall  also
 identify  buildings  that  have a historic design that the office deter-
 mines shall be unduly burdened by solar panels; and buildings  that  the
 office  determines  do not receive adequate sunlight to justify the cost
 of installation of solar panels.
  § 2. No later than one year after the effective date of this act,  the
 office  of  general  services shall report its findings of such study to
 the governor and the legislature, as described under section one of this
 act.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately, and shall expire  and  be
 deemed repealed one year after such effective date.
