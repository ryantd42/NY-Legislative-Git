 TRANSIT SERVICE operated by the authority and no general revision of the
 system of transfers applicable to the use  of  all  such  facilities  in
 effect as of that date shall be established without the written approval
 of  the  mayor.  For  the  purposes  of this subdivision the term "zonal
 system of fares" shall mean any system whereby the fare payable for  the
 use of a rapid transit facility or an omnibus line facility OR ANY PARA-
 TRANSIT  SERVICE OPERATED BY THE AUTHORITY or of any part thereof varies
 according to distance traveled or to the location of the point of  entry

 PARATRANSIT PILOT" SHALL MEAN THE SERVICE CREATED  BY  THE  METROPOLITAN
 TRANSPORTATION  AUTHORITY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN, THROUGH WHICH USERS
