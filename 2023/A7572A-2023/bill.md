  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS  BERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  457  2
  - Average Age:  53.3  50.0
  - Average Service:  16.8  15.5
  - Average Salary:  125,900  122,600
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS:  Currently,  Tier  4 Auto 25-Year Plan
 members who never previously participated in either the  55/25  plan  or
 57/5  plan enacted by Chapter 96 of the Laws of 1995 and who retire with
 30 or more years of service, receive a service retirement  benefit  that
 is equal to 60% of Final Average Salary (FAS).
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the service retirement benefit for
 such members with 30 or more years of service would be calculated as the
 greater of the above, and:
  * For those at least age 62, 60% of FAS plus 1.5% of FAS for each year
 of service beyond 30 years.
  * For those age 55 through 61, 60% of FAS plus 1.5% of  FAS  for  each
 year  of  service  beyond  30  years, multiplied by the applicable early
 retirement age reduction factor.
  The service retirement benefits for Tier 6 Auto 25-Year  Plan  members
 and  Tier 4 members with previous Tier 4 55/25 plan or 57/5 plan partic-
 ipation are assumed to remain unchanged.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
