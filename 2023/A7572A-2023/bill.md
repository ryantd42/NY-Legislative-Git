  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would  amend  Sections  603
 and  604-g  of  the  Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to permit
 Tier 4 and Tier 6 members in the New  York  City  Employees'  Retirement
 System  (NYCERS)  and  the  New  York City Board of Education Retirement
 System (BERS) Automotive 25-Year/Age 50 Plans (Auto 25-Year  Plan)  with
 A. 7572  3

 30  or  more  years  of  service to receive a service retirement benefit
 calculated under their respective basic plans, if greater.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT  ON  BENEFITS:  Currently, Auto 25-Year Plan members who retire
 with 30 or more years of service receive a  service  retirement  benefit
 that is equal to 60% of Final Average Salary (FAS).
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the service retirement benefit for
 Auto 25-Year Plan members with 30 or more  years  of  service  would  be
 calculated as the greater of the above, and:
  *  For  Tier  4  members, 60% of FAS plus 1.5% of FAS for each year of
 service beyond 30 years.
  * For Tier 6 members, 55% of FAS plus 2%  of  FAS  for  each  year  of
 service beyond 30 years.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  result in an increase in the present
 value of future employer contributions of  approximately  $26.4  million
 for NYCERS and approximately $0.1 million for BERS, for a total increase
 of approximately $26.5 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to NYCERS and BERS, there would  be  an  increase  in  the
 Unfunded  Accrued  Liability (UAL) of approximately $16.7 million and an
 increase in the present value of future employer Normal Cost of approxi-
 mately $9.8 million.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of
 this  proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in annual
 employer  contributions  of  approximately  $2,855,000  for  NYCERS  and
 approximately  $9,000 for BERS which is the result of an increase in the
 Normal Cost in addition to the UAL payment.
  The initial increase in employer  contributions  is  estimated  to  be
 $2,372,000  for  New  York  City  and $492,000 for the non-New York City
 obligors.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 14 years
 for NYCERS and 11 years for BERS and the increase in UAL  was  therefore
 amortized  over  a  14-year  period  (13 payments under the One-Year Lag
 Methodology) for NYCERS and over an 11-year  period  (10  payments)  for
 BERS using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS and BERS to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The table below contains a summary of the census data for active  Auto
 25-Year Plan members in NYCERS and BERS as of June 30, 2022.
 
 System  Active  Average  Average  Average
  Count  Age  Service  Salary
 
 NYCERS  1,718  45.7  9.6  $116,700
 BERS  25  51.8  8.0  $98,800
 
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions  of  NYCERS  and
 BERS.
 A. 7572  4
 
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuations  of  NYCERS and BERS used to determine employer contributions
 for Fiscal Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
