 Introduced  by M. of A. STERN -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Insurance
 
 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to annuity benefits
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraph  (E)  of  paragraph  1  of subsection (a) of
 section 4223 of the insurance law, as amended by a chapter of  the  laws
 of  2022  amending  the  insurance  law relating to authorizing dividend
 paying deferred income  annuities,  as  proposed  in  legislative  bills
 numbers S.  7744-A and A. 9128-A, is amended to read as follows:
  (E) (i) Except as provided in [clause] ITEM (ii) of this subparagraph,
 a  statement that the annuity benefits at the time of their commencement
 will not be less than those that would be provided by the application of
 an amount, hereinafter defined, to  purchase  any  single  consideration
 immediate  annuity  contract  offered  by the company at the time to the
 same class of annuitants. For  contracts  that  provide  cash  surrender
 benefits, such amount shall be the greater of the cash surrender benefit
 or  ninety-five  percent  of what the cash surrender benefit would be if
 there were no withdrawal charge. For contracts that do not provide  cash
 surrender  benefits, such amount shall be the present value of the paid-
 up annuity benefit  provided  under  the  contract  in  accordance  with
 subsection (d) of this section.
  (ii)  For  paid-up  deferred annuity contracts in which each consider-
 ation paid into the contract purchases guaranteed paid-up annuity  bene-
 fits  determined at the time the consideration is paid, a statement that
 the annuity benefits at the time each consideration is paid will not  be
 less than those that would be provided by the application of the consid-
 eration  to current purchase rates for new sales of such contract or any
 comparable paid-up deferred annuity contract offered by the  company  at
 that  time  to  the same class of annuitants. For purposes of this item,

 dividends applied to purchase paid-up additions to the contract shall be
 treated as considerations paid into the contract. [This statement]
  (III)  THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH IN ITEMS (I) AND (II) OF THIS SUBPARA-
 GRAPH shall not affect  the  amount  of  any  benefits  required  to  be
 provided under any other provision of this section.
  §  2.  This  act  shall  take  effect on the same date and in the same
 manner as a chapter of the laws  of  2022  amending  the  insurance  law
 relating  to  authorizing  dividend paying deferred income annuities, as
 proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 7744-A  and  A.  9128-A,  takes
 effect.
