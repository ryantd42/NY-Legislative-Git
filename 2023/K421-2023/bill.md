  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 7-13, 2023, as Compost  Awareness  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 7-13, 2023, as  Compost  Awareness
Week  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
International Compost Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Composting Council  Research  &  Education  Foundation,
along  with  Canada,  Australia,  the United Kingdom and other countries
have declared the first week of  May  to  be  the  annual  International
Compost Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Materials  such  as  yard  trimmings,  vegetable cuttings,
biosolids, food scraps, manures and hay shavings have all been composted
and converted into a beneficial product known as compost; and
 
  WHEREAS, A majority of wasted food in the United States is  disposed
of  in  landfills,  where  due  to improper treatment, it decomposes and
releases 15% of our nation's emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that
is one of the largest contributors towards climate change; and
 
  WHEREAS, Composting is an effective form of waste  reduction,  reuse
and recycling, and, since organic materials make up approximately 40% of
the  material  going  to  landfills  in the United States, composting is
becoming one of the primary  methods  communities  use  to  reach  waste
diversion goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Composting  is a way of returning organic resources to the
soil and is a way of conserving water during extreme drought or flooding
conditions, reducing water consumption and non-point  pollution,  and  a
proven  method  of decreasing the dependence on chemical fertilizers and
decreasing erosion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Communities,  through  their  local  governments,  highway
departments, soil conservation service and extension offices, and public
works  professionals,  can have significant impact on clean water, soil,
climate change and landfill diversion by using compost for public  works
projects; and
 
  WHEREAS, Composting creates green jobs and infrastructure for cities
and states that implement composting programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Composting  is  an  effective  way  to  aid  the  Climate
Leadership and Community Protection Act that  was  signed  into  law  in
2019,  with  the  goal  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by the
year 2030, and reach an 85% reduction in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by
2050; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Compost  Awareness  Week  is  a  publicity  and  education
initiative to showcase compost production and demonstrate  compost  use;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year's  theme,  "For  Healthier  Soil,  Healthier
Food...Compost!"  was selected to highlight  the  overall  regenerative
agriculture  movement  and  how  compost and organics recycling fit into
that process; and
 
  WHEREAS, Soil plays an important role in  our  environment;  healthy
soil is at the heart of planetary, agricultural and human health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  composting,  we  return  nutrients  to  the soil, help
capture carbon from the atmosphere,  resist  drought  and  disease,  and
provide fresh air; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 7-13 2023, as  Compost
Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the Composting Council Research & Education Foundation.
