  §  5. Section 301 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law
 is amended by adding a new subdivision 6 to read as follows:
  6. THE BOARD SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ISSUE LICENSES  TO  THE  CATSKILL

 RATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING HARNESS RACE MEETINGS AT MONTICELLO
 RACETRACK  AND TO MAKE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO SAID TRACK, PROVIDED THAT

 A. 3543  4
 
 FIVE  AND FIVE-A OF THIS CHAPTER, SAID CORPORATION SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE
 A HARNESS  RACING  CORPORATION  WITH  RESPECT  TO  PARI-MUTUEL  WAGERING
 CONDUCTED AT SAID TRACK PURSUANT TO THIS CHAPTER, EXCEPT THAT NET REVEN-
 UES  DERIVED  FROM  SUCH PARI-MUTUEL WAGERING SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG
 THE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CORPORATION ON THE BASIS OF  POPU-
 LATION,  AS DEFINED AS THE TOTAL POPULATION IN EACH PARTICIPATING COUNTY
 SHOWN BY THE LATEST PRECEDING DECENNIAL FEDERAL CENSUS OF  THE  CALENDAR

  §  6.  The  opening  paragraph  of subdivision 1 of section 527 of the
 racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by chapter 243
 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  The disposition of the retained commission from pools  resulting  from
 regular,  multiple or exotic bets, as the case may be, whether placed on
 races run within a region or  outside  a  region,  conducted  by  racing
 corporations, harness racing associations or corporations, quarter horse
 racing associations or corporations or races run outside the state shall
 be governed by the tables in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision. The
 rate  denominated  "state  tax" shall represent the rate of a reasonable
 tax imposed upon the retained commission for the privilege of conducting
 off-track pari-mutuel betting, which tax is hereby levied and  shall  be
 payable  in the manner set forth in this section. Each off-track betting
 corporation shall pay to the commission as a regulatory fee,  which  fee
 is  hereby levied, six-tenths of one percent of the total daily pools of
 such corporation. Each corporation shall also pay twenty percent of  the
 breaks  derived  from  bets  on  harness  races and fifty percent of the
 breaks derived from bets on all other races to the agriculture  and  New
 York  State  horse breeding and development fund and to the thoroughbred
 breeding and development fund, the total of such payments to  be  appor-
 tioned  fifty  percent  to  each  such  fund.  For  the purposes of this
 section, the New York city, Suffolk, Nassau, and  the  Catskill  regions
 shall  constitute  a  single  region  and any thoroughbred track located
 within the Capital District region shall be deemed  to  be  within  such
 single  region.  A  "regional  meeting" shall refer to either harness or
 thoroughbred meetings, or both, except  that  a  franchised  corporation
 shall not be a regional track for the purpose of receiving distributions
 from bets on thoroughbred races conducted by a thoroughbred track in the
 Catskill  region  conducting  a  mixed  meeting. With the exception of a
 harness racing association or  corporation  first  licensed  to  conduct
 pari-mutuel  wagering at a track located in Tioga, Saratoga, SULLIVAN or
 Westchester county after January first, two thousand five, racing corpo-
 rations first licensed  to  conduct  pari-mutuel  racing  after  January
 first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six or a harness racing association or
 corporation first licensed to conduct pari-mutuel wagering  at  a  track
 located  in  Genesee  County after January first, two thousand five, and
 quarter horse tracks shall not be "regional tracks"; if  there  is  more
 than  one harness track within a region, such tracks shall evenly divide
 payments made pursuant to the tables in  paragraphs  a  and  b  of  this
 subdivision  when  neither track is running. In the event a track elects
 to reduce its retained percentage from any or  all  of  its  pari-mutuel
 pools, the payments to the track holding the race and the regional track
 required  by  paragraphs a and b of this subdivision shall be reduced in
 proportion to such reduction. Nothing in this section shall be construed
 to authorize the conduct of off-track betting contrary to the provisions
 of section five hundred twenty-three of this article.
  § 7. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
