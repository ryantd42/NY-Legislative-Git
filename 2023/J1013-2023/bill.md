  COMMEMORATING  the  18th Anniversary of the Jewish
  Children's Museum
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  the  quality
of  life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched by
its exceptional cultural, educational and recreational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 18th Anniversary of the Jewish Children's Museum; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the late fall  of  1986,  the  founders  of  the  Jewish
Children's  Museum  held its first Jewish Children's Expo, which started
the journey which would lead to the Jewish Children's Museum;  the  Expo
turned  30,000  square feet of the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New
York City into a wonderland of Jewish experiences;  over  30,000  people
visited the first Jewish Children's Expo, a four-day event; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The multi-media Jewish Children's Museum, the first of its
kind in the world, opened in 2004 on Brooklyn's Museum Row at the corner
of Eastern Parkway and Kingston Avenue in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The heart of the museum is in the  galleries  which  occupy
the  third  and  fourth  of  the  building's  six  floors where visitors
encounter an array of exhibits and displays covering Jewish history  and
heroes,  holidays  and  customs,  the Holocaust, and contemporary Jewish
life; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Jewish  Children's  Museum  is  an  institution  where
children  and  their  parents  from  all  segments  of the community can
explore  their  history  and  heritage  in  a  stimulating,  interactive
environment;  it  also  provides  the  non-Jewish world with a forum for
understanding the Jewish community and its contributions to history  and
culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of the Jewish Children's Museum is in direct
correlation to the efforts of  its  dedicated  staff  and  board,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the organization and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
institutions  of  such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be recognized and applauded by all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 18th Anniversary of the Jewish Children's Museum; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Jewish Children's Museum.
