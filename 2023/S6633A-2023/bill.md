 AN ACT to authorize the county of Suffolk and the village of Nissequogue
  to offer an optional twenty-year retirement  plan  to  police  officer
  Bridget Topping

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the county of Suffolk and the village of Nissequogue, in the  county  of
 Suffolk,  participating employers in the New York state and local police
 and fire retirement  system,  which  previously  elected  to  offer  the
 optional  twenty-year  retirement  plan, established pursuant to section
 384-d of the retirement and social  security  law,  to  police  officers
 employed  by  such  county  and  village,  are hereby authorized to make
 participation in such plan available to Bridget Topping, a police  offi-
 cer  employed  full-time  by  the county of Suffolk and part-time by the
 village of Nissequogue, who, for  reasons  not  ascribable  to  her  own
 negligence,  failed  to make a timely application to participate in such
 optional twenty-year retirement plan. The  county  of  Suffolk  and  the
 village  of Nissequogue may so elect by separately filing with the state
 comptroller, within nine months of  the  effective  date  of  this  act,
 resolutions of its own county legislature and the village board of trus-
 tees  together  with  certification that such police officer did not bar
 herself from participation in such retirement plan as a  result  of  her
 own  negligence. Thereafter, such police officer may elect to be covered
 by the provisions of section 384-d of the retirement and social security
 law and shall be entitled to the full  rights  and  benefits  associated
 with  coverage  under such section as well as section 384-e of such law,
 by filing a request to that effect with the state comptroller within one
 year of the effective date of this act.

  § 2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing  the
 provisions  of  this act shall be borne by the county of Suffolk and may
 be amortized over a ten-year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow the County of Suffolk and the Village of Nisseq-
 uogue  to  reopen the provisions of section 384-d, together with section
 384-e, of the Retirement and Social  Security  Law  for  police  officer
 Bridget Topping.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $11,000 in the
 annual contributions of the County of Suffolk and $1,800 in  the  annual
 contributions  of  the Village of Nissequogue for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, these costs will vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of Bridget Topping change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $449,000 which will be
 borne by the County of Suffolk as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that payment will be made on February 1, 2024. If the County of
 Suffolk elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 the first year including interest would be $57,300.
