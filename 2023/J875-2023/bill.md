  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  set  aside to increase awareness of serious matters that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1, 2023, as May Day in
the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
International Workers' Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the great
Empire  State,  appreciates  all  workers,  men  and  women,  union  and
non-union, farm workers, and workers in the private and public  sectors,
who  work  every  day  to  make  New  York  more productive and fiscally
healthier and stronger; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body also remembers the Haymarket rally in
Chicago in 1886, generally considered significant as the origin  of  May
Day, observing workers' rightful demands for an eight-hour workday; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  day, the strong union traditions in New York
State as well as the belief in hard work and work ethics for  union  and
non-union  workers  are  proudly recognized and observed as are New York
workers' freedom to organize in unions and  for  collective  bargaining;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  May  1st  is recognized and celebrated across the world as
May Day in recognition of International Workers' Day; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1, 2023, as May Day in
the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
