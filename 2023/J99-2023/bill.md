  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 4, 2023, as Cheese Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  noteworthy  events  in  America's  history  which  deserve
special recognition such as the creation of Cheese Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 4,  2023,  as  Cheese
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Cheese Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life,  and
high  content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus; cheese making is
an ancient craft which dates back to somewhere around 8000  BCE  shortly
after the domestication of animals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  the  United  States is the biggest producer of
cheese, making up 29% of the global market, followed by Germany, France,
and Italy; the top cheese producing states are Wisconsin and California;
more than two and a half  billion  pounds  of  cheese  are  produced  in
Wisconsin, which also has the highest number of milk cows; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Total  consumption  of  all  types of cheese in the United
States stands slightly lower than the production volume, meaning,  every
American  consumes  around  15  kilograms  of  cheese annually; the most
popular types of cheese among United States consumers are  Italian-style
varieties like mozzarella and parmesan; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1851, in Hicks Mills, New York, Jesse Williams perfected
the  techniques  for  the  commercial  manufacture  of  cheese,  forever
changing the production of cheese in the North  Country,  and  New  York
State as a whole; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On January 6, 1864, a group of dairymen, cheese makers and
manufacturers led by Jesse Williams,  assembled  at  the  Courthouse  in
Rome,  New  York,  where  they  formed  the  New  York  State  Cheese
Manufacturers' Association; over 100 men paid one dollar each to  become
a member; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  York State Cheese Manufacturers' Association was
founded to encourage, assist, advise and aid its members in  the  making
of New York State Cheese; promote the sale of cheese manufactured in the
State of New York; improve and control the quality of cheese made by its
members;  own and control trademarks, labels and insignia under the same
corporation to be used by its members on quality cheese; and to  set  up
standards of quality; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  importance  of the use of top-quality milk for cheese
making prompted the members of the Association to include milk producers
in the organization; therefore in 1865, they proposed a  more  inclusive
 
name,  and  became  The American Dairymen's Association, which continued
into modern times; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1943,  a  group of cheddar cheese manufacturers met in
Lowville,  New  York,  to  re-establish  the  New  York  State  Cheese
Manufacturers'  Association  which  met  regularly  in  Watertown  and
Syracuse, New York, to discuss  economic,  legislative  and  educational
issues,  and  maintain  close  ties  with  the  producer cooperatives to
improve the economic climate of the dairy industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since  1971,  the  Association  has  been  affiliated  with
Cornell  University  with  faculty  and  staff  serving as secretary and
scientific and technical advisors, providing  a  vital  information  and
educational link to the industry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State  has  one  of the most varied and vibrant
cultures of artisanal cheesemaking in  the  country;  according  to  the
United  States  Department  of  Agriculture,  New  York  is  home  to 85
cheese-manufacturing plants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Independent, artisanal dairy farms and creameries exist all
over the State, from the Adirondacks to the Finger Lakes,  and  even  in
Brooklyn;  they vary greatly in size, and in the range of techniques and
traditions they have adopted, but they all have one thing in  common:  a
commitment  to  making  the  best,  most  interesting  (and  often
award-winning) cheese they can; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, there are thousands of varieties of cheese,  ranging
from  mild  to mature in flavor, and low- to high-fat in composition; it
can be made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, and other animals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cheese is a standard accompaniment to  popular  foods  like
burgers,  pizza,  Mexican dishes, salad, and sandwiches; it can be added
to sauces, soups, pastries, and may other dishes, and alone, it can be a
snack or an appetizer; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 4, 2023, as Cheese
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
