 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  granting  retroactive membership with Tier IV
  status in the New York state and local employees' retirement system to
  Ronald Bower
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of the law to the
 contrary, Ronald Bower,  an  employee  of  the  Genesee  County  Highway
 Department  and  a  member  of  the  New York state and local employees'
 retirement system, who was employed in the Occupational  Skills  Program
 at  Erie  1  BOCES beginning November 12, 1986 through July 6, 1988, who
 for reasons not ascribable to his own negligence,  failed  to  become  a
 member  of  such  retirement  system when first employed by Erie 1 BOCES
 beginning in 1986, shall be deemed to have been a member of the New York
 state and local employees'  retirement  system  on  such  date  that  he
 commenced  his  employment  with  Erie 1 BOCES on November 12, 1986, and
 shall be granted Tier IV status in such retirement system, provided that
 an application is filed with the head of the New York  state  and  local
 employees'  retirement system within one year from the effective date of
 this act. Upon the granting of such retroactive membership, Ronald Bower
 shall not be granted a refund of any employee contribution made  by  him
 to the New York state and local employees' retirement system.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system by Ronald Bower shall be returned or refunded  to  him
 pursuant to this act.

 S. 2791--A  2
 
  § 3. All past service costs associated with the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by Erie 1 BOCES.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  Fiscal Note.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide  Ronald  Bower with a date of membership of
 November 12, 1986, their date of first employment with the Erie 1 BOCES,
 resulting in Tier 4 status in the New York State  and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement System. Ronald Bower is currently a Tier 6 member. There will
 be no refund of member contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $3,900 in the
 annual contributions of Genesee County for the fiscal year ending  March
 31,  2025.  In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of Ronald Bower change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately  $9,150  which  will  be
 borne  by the Erie 1 BOCES as a one-time payment.  This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
