BY: Senator BAILEY
 
  CELEBRATING Father's Day on June 18, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  From  time  to  time  this  Legislative Body takes note of
certain extraordinary individuals  it  wishes  to  recognize  for  their
valued contributions to the success and progress of society and publicly
acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to  join
with the special men in their lives to celebrate Father's Day on Sunday,
June 18, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fifty-eight  years  after  the  founding  of Mother's Day,
President Richard Nixon declared Father's Day  an  official  holiday  in
1972; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Just  like Mother's Day, Father's Day is a way of honoring
the sacrifices fathers make for their children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, over 50 years later, Father's Day  remains  the  one
day  out of the year to praise and pay tribute to fathers, and all other
men who have taken on that role and acted as a father  figure  in  their
children's  lives, including those being raised in a single parent home,
whether it be an uncle, stepfather, grandfather, friend or big  brother;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These outstanding men show great strength and selflessness,
as  well  as  spend  countless  hours  offering  their love, support and
guidance to the children in their  lives,  acting  as  role  models  and
inspiring them to develop to their fullest potential; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is proud to pay tribute and commend
all fathers and father figures who are worthy of  full  recognition  for
their  valued  contributions  and  who  should  be celebrated by all the
citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
celebrate Father's Day on June 18, 2023.
