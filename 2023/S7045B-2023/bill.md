 AN ACT to amend the cannabis law and the state finance law, in  relation
  to enacting the "cannabis adult-use transition act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "cannabis adult-use transition act".
  §  2. Legislative findings and intent. Chapter 92 of the laws of 2021,
 known as the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, legalized and  regu-
 lated cannabis for adult-use; expanded and improved the medical cannabis
 program and the hemp program; established the Cannabis Control Board and
 the  Office  of  Cannabis Management, and codified historical social and
 economic equity policies. Chapter 18 of the laws  of  2022  created  the
 conditional  adult-use  cultivator  and processor licenses to jump start
 New York's adult-use cannabis market with small New York farmers.
  The legislature recognizes that due  to  a  variety  of  circumstances
 beyond  the  control  of  New  York's cannabis licensees and applicants,
 there have been delays and unforeseen challenges with the implementation
 of various components  of  the  state's  cannabis  markets.  Conditional
 cultivators  cannot  afford  to  process  their  cannabis  or sell their
 finished products; conditional processors are  struggling  with  limited
 retail  outlets;  conditional  adult-use retail dispensary licensees and
 applicants do not have access to capital, locations,  or  the  resources
 they  need  to  become  operational;  and the state's medical registered
 organizations and patients are facing  a  diminishing  medical  cannabis
 market.  As  a  result, the state's cannabis industries are losing value
 and jobs, patients are being left behind,  and  the  illicit  market  is
 growing.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
