 the applicant, and if the applicant is a  co-partnership  [or],  associ-
 ation  OR  LIMITED  LIABILITY COMPANY, of every member thereof, and if a

  § 369. Conditions precedent to issuing license; issuance and filing of
 license;  posting  license. 1. If the superintendent shall find that the
 S. 3237--A  3
 
 financial responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness  of
 the applicant, and of the members thereof if the applicant be a co-part-
 nership [or], association OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, and of the offi-
 cers  and  directors thereof if the applicant be a corporation, are such
 as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant belief that
 the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and  efficiently  within
 the  purposes of this article, and if the superintendent shall find that
 the granting of such application will promote the convenience and advan-
 tage of the area in which such business is to be conducted, and  if  the
 superintendent shall find that the applicant has available for the oper-
 ation  of  such  business  for  each location and for each [mobile unit]
 LIMITED STATION specified in the application liquid assets of  at  least
 ten  thousand  dollars,  the  superintendent  shall  thereupon execute a
 license in duplicate to permit the cashing of checks, drafts  and  money
 orders in accordance with the provisions of this article at the location
 or  in  the  area  specified in such application. In finding whether the
 application will promote the convenience and advantage  to  the  public,
 the superintendent shall determine whether there is a community need for
 a  new  licensee  in the proposed area to be served. No license shall be
 issued to an applicant for a license, at a location to be licensed which
 is closer than one thousand five hundred eighty-four feet  (three-tenths
 of a mile) from an existing licensee, except with the written consent of
 such existing licensee or pursuant to subdivision three of section three
 hundred seventy of this article, subject to any restriction or condition
 as  the  superintendent may promulgate by regulation; provided, however,
 the superintendent may permit a location to be licensed that  is  closer
 than  three-tenths  of  a  mile  from an existing licensee provided such
 applicant engages in the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders  only
 for  payees  of  such checks, drafts or money orders that are other than
 natural persons at the location to be licensed and  such  applicant  was
 engaged in the cashing of such checks, drafts or money orders for payees
 that  are  other  than natural persons at such location on or before the
 fourteenth day of July, two thousand four,  and  provided  further  that
 upon  licensing any such location by the superintendent, such license as
 it pertains solely to such location shall not be affected thereafter  by
 any  change of control of such license pursuant to section three hundred
 seventy-a of this article, provided that the licensee  continues  there-
 after  to  engage  at  that location in the cashing of checks, drafts or
 money orders only for payees that are other  than  natural  persons  and
 provided further that such license shall bear a legend stating that such
 location  is restricted to the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders
 only for payees that are other than natural persons. The three-tenths of
 a mile distance requirement as set forth in this section shall not apply
 in cases where the existing licensee is a restricted location as author-
 ized in the preceding sentence, or is any other licensed  location  that
 engages solely in the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders only for
 payees  that  are  other  than  natural  persons.  For  purposes of this
 section, such distance shall be measured on a straight  line  along  the
 street  between the nearest point of the store fronts of the check cash-
 ing facilities. The primary business of the licensee, at the location to
 be licensed, shall be financial services. The superintendent shall tran-
 smit one copy of such license to the applicant and file another  in  the
 office  of  the  department. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
 this subdivision, the superintendent, upon application by  an  applicant
 and  for  good  cause  shown,  may  permit a reduction from ten thousand
 S. 3237--A  4
 
 dollars to not less than five thousand dollars of minimum liquid  assets
 required for each location.
  2.  Such  license  shall  state  the  name of the licensee; and if the
 licensee is a co-partnership  [or],  association  OR  LIMITED  LIABILITY
 COMPANY,  the  names  of  the  members thereof; and if the licensee is a
 corporation, the date of its incorporation; and if the business is to be
 conducted at a specific address, the address at which such  business  is
 to  be conducted; and if the business is to be conducted through the use
 of a [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION,  the  New  York  state  registration
 number or other identification of such [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION and
 the area in which such [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION is authorized to do
 business.
  3.  Such  license  shall  be kept conspicuously posted in the place of
 business of the licensee or, in the case  of  a  [mobile  unit]  LIMITED
 STATION,  upon  such  [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION.  Such license shall
 not be transferable or assignable.
  4. Such license shall remain in full force  and  effect  until  it  is
 surrendered  by the licensee or revoked or suspended as provided in this
 article.
  5. If the superintendent shall find that the applicant fails  to  meet
 any of the conditions set forth in subdivision one of this section, [he]
 SUCH  SUPERINTENDENT  shall not issue such license, and [he] SUCH SUPER-
 INTENDENT shall notify the applicant of the denial.  If an  application
 is  denied  or  withdrawn,  the superintendent shall retain the investi-
 gation fee to cover the  costs  of  investigating  the  application  and
 return the license fee to the applicant.
  6.  The  superintendent may, consistent with article twenty-three-A of
 the correction law, refuse to issue a license pursuant to  this  article
 if [he] SUCH SUPERINTENDENT shall find that the applicant, or any person
 who  is  a  director,  officer,  partner, agent, employee or substantial
 stockholder of the applicant, (a) has been convicted of a crime  in  any
 jurisdiction  or  (b)  is  associating or consorting with any person who
 has, or persons who have, been convicted of a crime  or  crimes  in  any
 jurisdiction  or  jurisdictions.  For  the  purposes  of this article, a
 person shall be deemed to have been convicted of a crime if such  person
 shall  have  pleaded guilty to a charge thereof before a court or magis-
 trate, or shall have been found guilty thereof by the decision or  judg-
 ment  of a court or magistrate or by the verdict of a jury, irrespective
 of the pronouncement of sentence or the  suspension  thereof.  The  term
 "substantial  stockholder," as used in this subdivision, shall be deemed
 to refer to a person owning or controlling ten per centum or more of the
 total outstanding stock of the corporation in which  such  person  is  a
 stockholder. In making a determination pursuant to this subdivision, the
 superintendent shall require fingerprinting of the applicant. Such fing-
 erprints shall be submitted to the division of criminal justice services
 for a state criminal history record check, as defined in subdivision one
 of  section  three thousand thirty-five of the education law, and may be
 submitted to the federal bureau of investigation for a national criminal
 history record check.
  7. No license pursuant to this article shall be issued to  any  appli-
 cant  to  do  business  at the place specified in the application as the
 place where the business is to be conducted if, within the twelve months
 preceding such application, a license to engage in business pursuant  to
 this article at such place shall have been revoked.
  §  6. Section 370 of the banking law, as amended by chapter 151 of the
 laws of 1945, subdivision 2 as amended by section 38 of part O of  chap-
 S. 3237--A  5
 
 ter  59  of the laws of 2006 and subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 703
 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  § 370.  Restrictions as to place or area of doing business; establish-
 ment of stations; change of location. 1. No more than one place of busi-
 ness or one [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION shall be maintained under  the
 same  license;  provided,  however,  that  more  than one license may be
 issued to the same licensee upon compliance with the provisions of  this
 article for each new license.
  2.  Any  licensed  casher of checks may open and maintain, within this
 state, one or more limited stations for the purpose of  cashing  checks,
 drafts  or  money orders for the particular group or groups specified in
 the license authorizing  each  such  station.  Such  stations  shall  be
 licensed  pursuant to and be subject to all the provisions of this chap-
 ter applicable to licensed cashers  of  checks,  except  that  (a)  such
 station  shall  not  be  subject to the distance limitation set forth in
 subdivision one of section three hundred sixty-nine of this article, (b)
 the fee for investigating the application for  a  station  shall  be  as
 prescribed pursuant to section eighteen-a of this chapter, and (c) where
 such  a  station  is  at  the  premises  of a specified employer for the
 purpose of cashing checks, drafts and money orders for the employees  of
 such  employer,  the fees and charges for cashing such checks, drafts or
 money orders shall not be subject to the limitations of subdivision  one
 of  section  three  hundred seventy-two of this article if such fees and
 charges are paid by such employer.
  3. A licensee may make a written application to the superintendent for
 leave to change [his or her] SUCH LICENSEE'S place of  business,  or  in
 the case of a [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION, the area in which such unit
 is  authorized  to  be  operated,  stating the reasons for such proposed
 change.  Such application may be approved for  relocation  from  a  site
 within three-tenths of a mile of another licensee to another site within
 three-tenths  of  a  mile  of such other licensee provided that such new
 site is farther from such existing licensee than  the  site  from  which
 permission to relocate is sought. Only in situations in which a licensee
 seeks  to  change  its  place  of  business due to extraordinary circum-
 stances, as may be determined by the superintendent  pursuant  to  regu-
 lations,  may  the  superintendent,  [in his or her] AT SUCH SUPERINTEN-
 DENT'S discretion, determine that an application  may  be  approved  for
 relocation from a site within three-tenths of a mile of another licensee
 to  a  new  site which is closer to such existing licensee than the site
 from which permission to relocate is sought. Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision of this subdivision, a licensee may relocate from any location
 to  a location that is within three-tenths of a mile from another licen-
 see with the written consent of the other licensee. If  the  superinten-
 dent  approves  such  application  [he  or she] THE SUPERINTENDENT shall
 issue a new license in duplicate in accordance with  the  provisions  of
 section  three  hundred  sixty-nine  of  this  article,  stating the new
 location of such licensee or, in the case of  a  [mobile  unit]  LIMITED
 STATION, the new area in which such [mobile unit] LIMITED STATION may be
 operated.
  §  7.  Subdivision  4 of section 370-a of the banking law, as added by
 chapter 142 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:
  4. As used in this section[: (a) the term "person" includes  an  indi-
 vidual, partnership, corporation, association or any other organization,
 and (b)], the term "control" means the possession, directly or indirect-
 ly,  of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and
 policies of a licensee, whether through the ownership of voting stock of
 S. 3237--A  6
 
 such licensee, the  ownership  of  voting  stock  of  any  person  which
 possesses such power or otherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if
 any  person,  directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with power
 to vote ten per centum or more of the voting stock of any licensee or of
 any  person  which  owns,  controls  or holds with power to vote ten per
 centum or more of the voting stock of any licensee, but no person  shall
 be  deemed to control a licensee solely by reason of being an officer or
 director of such licensee or person. The superintendent may [in his]  AT
 SUCH  SUPERINTENDENT'S discretion, upon the application of a licensee or
 any person who, directly or indirectly, owns,  controls  or  holds  with
 power  to  vote  or seeks to own, control or hold with power to vote any
 voting stock of such licensee, determine whether or not  the  ownership,
 control  or holding of such voting stock constitutes or would constitute
 control of such licensee for purposes of this section.

 laws of 1945, is amended to read as follows:

 regulations;  provided,  however, that no maximum fee shall apply to the
 charging of fees by licensees for the cashing of checks, drafts or money
 orders for payees of such checks, drafts or money orders that are  other
 than natural persons.

 OR SOLICITATION INCLUDES A LINK DIRECTLY TO SUCH WEBSITE,  AND  PROVIDED
 THIS DOES NOT MODIFY IN-STORE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.

 after the superintendent shall notify the majority leader of the senate,
 the speaker of the assembly, and the chairmen of  both  the  senate  and
 assembly committees on banks of [his] SUCH SUPERINTENDENT'S intention to
 change fees.

 this subdivision shall continue to be the maximum allowable  fees  until

 accounts, and records as the superintendent may require  to  carry  into
 effect the provisions of this article and the rules and regulations made

 tation;  or  (b)  has  violated any provisions of the banking law or any
 regulation issued pursuant thereto, or has violated any other law in the
 course of [its or his] SUCH LICENSEE'S dealings as a licensed casher  of
 checks;  or  (c)  has made a false statement in the application for such
 license or failed to give a true reply to a question  in  such  applica-
 tion;  or (d) has demonstrated [his or its] SUCH LICENSEE'S incompetency
 or untrustworthiness to act as a licensed casher of checks;  or  (e)  is
 not  doing  sufficient  business pursuant to this article to justify the
 continuance of the license, or if [he] SUCH  SUPERINTENDENT  shall  find
 that  any  ground  or  grounds  exist which would require or warrant the
 refusal of an application for the issuance of the  license  if  such  an
 application  were then before [him] SUCH SUPERINTENDENT.  Such a hearing
 shall be held in the manner and upon such notice as may be prescribed by
 the superintendent. Pending  an  investigation  or  a  hearing  for  the
 suspension  or  revocation of any license or licenses issued pursuant to
 this article, the superintendent may temporarily suspend such license or
 licenses for a period not to exceed ninety  days,  provided  the  super-
 intendent  shall  find that such a temporary suspension is in the public
 interest.
