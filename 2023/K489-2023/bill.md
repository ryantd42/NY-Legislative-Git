  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 2023, as Ice Cream Month in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges  noteworthy  events  in  America's  history  which  deserve
special recognition such as the creation of Ice Cream Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim July 2023, as Ice Cream
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Ice Cream Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1984,  President  Ronald  Reagan  designated  July  as
National Ice Cream Month and the third Sunday of the month  as  National
Ice Cream Day; he recognized ice cream as a fun and nutritious food that
is enjoyed by a full 90 percent of the nation's population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  in  the Presidential Proclamation, President
Reagan called for all people of  the  United  States  to  observe  these
events with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the International Dairy Foods Association, ice
cream  is  an  $11 billion industry that supports 26,000 direct jobs and
generates $1.6 billion in direct wages; and
 
  WHEREAS, Approximately nine percent of  all  the  milk  produced  by
United  States  dairy farmers is used to produce ice cream, contributing
significantly to the economic well-being of the nation's dairy industry;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In its lifetime, a dairy cow can produce  enough  milk  for
nearly 9,000 gallons of ice cream; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Americans  consume  approximately  23 gallons of ice cream
each year; to make one gallon of ice cream, you need 12 pounds of  milk;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most  of the ice cream and frozen dessert manufacturers in
America have been in business for more than 50 years, and many are still
family-owned businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, It was during World War II when ice cream became an  edible
morale  symbol;  in  1945,  the  United States Navy built a floating ice
cream parlor for our sailors fighting  in  the  Pacific;  when  the  war
ended,  and  dairy  product rationing was lifted, America celebrated its
victory with ice cream; the following year, Americans consumed  over  20
quarts  of ice cream per person; at this time, the entire world accepted
ice cream as a perfect summertime treat; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dairy industry of the Empire State is second to none in
quality, productivity and tasty goodness; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  For  countless  generations,  Dairy  Farmers  have  worked
diligently to provide a surplus of dairy throughout the New  York  State
region;  in  addition,  they have proactively taken steps to improve cow
comfort and care, and have hosted area Farm Fests  to  educate  students
about cows and the dairy industry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2020, Dairy Farms throughout New York came together to
help disperse thousands of gallons of milk to  families  in  need;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2023,  as  Ice  Cream
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Ice Cream Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
