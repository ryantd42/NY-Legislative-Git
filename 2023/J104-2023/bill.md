  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Stress Awareness Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
ailments that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 2023, as Stress
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Stress Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Stress Awareness Month has been held every April
since 1992; during this annual 30-day period, health care  professionals
and  health promotion experts across the country join forces to increase
public awareness about both the causes and cures for our  modern  stress
epidemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sponsored  by  The  Health  Resource  Network  (HRN),  a
non-profit health education organization, Stress Awareness  Month  is  a
national,  cooperative  effort  to  inform  people  about the dangers of
stress, successful coping strategies, and harmful  misconceptions  about
stress that are prevalent in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Even though a lot has been learned about stress in the past
two  decades,  Morton  C. Orman, MD, Founder and Director of HRN, claims
there is still a long way to go; new information is now  available  that
could help millions of Americans eliminate their suffering; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Morton  C.  Orman  has  invited  leading  health care
organizations across the country  to  develop  and  disseminate  helpful
educational  materials  and  other  information  about stress during the
month of April; he is also encouraging stress experts and  other  health
care  leaders  to  conduct  public  forums, discussion groups, and other
informative community events; and
 
  WHEREAS, While we  cannot  avoid  stress  altogether,  we  can  take
measures  to reduce the impact it has and prepare ourselves to deal with
the stress at hand; consider these  tips  to  tame  stress  and  improve
quality  of  life:  just breathe, get moving, laugh, get connected, and
assert yourself; and
 
  WHEREAS, In honor of Stress Awareness Month, individuals should take
some time to get more informed and become better aware of how stress  is
impacting them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Stress
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and The Health Resource Network.
