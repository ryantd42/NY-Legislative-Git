  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 20, 2023, as Transatlantic  Flight  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 20, 2023, as Transatlantic  Flight
Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Charles  A.  Lindbergh  commenced  his  historic, non-stop
transatlantic flight from New York to Paris at Garden  City's  Roosevelt
Field; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lindbergh, a United States Air Mail pilot, made his journey
in the single-seat, single-engine monoplane, Spirit of St. Louis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  May 20-21, 1927, journey, covering 3,510 miles, was a
landmark event  in  aviation  and  the  history  of  our  Nation,  which
revolutionized the course of aviation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The feat took Lindbergh from virtual obscurity to worldwide
fame  as  he  claimed  a  reward offered by New York hotel owner Raymond
Orteig to the first allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from New York City
to Paris or vice-versa; and
 
  WHEREAS, Commencing five years later on  that  same  date,  May  20,
1932,  Amelia  Earhart  emulated  Lindbergh's  flight becoming the first
woman to fly solo  across  the  Atlantic  for  which  she  received  the
Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1997, a monument to Charles Lindbergh, commemorating the
70th  Anniversary  of  his  takeoff,  was erected at the intersection of
Source Mall Drive and Transverse Drive in East Garden  City,  New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Town of Hempstead and area residents have been working
to protect the monument and  the  historic  area,  as  well  as  develop
further educational and visitor activities at the site; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of  New  York,  is proud to proclaim official days that are set aside to
recognize important events in the history of our State and  Nation,  and
to express support and gratitude for the commitment shown by the members
of the Town of Hempstead Landmarks Preservation Committee in recognizing
this site; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the practice of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  20,  2023,  as
Transatlantic Flight Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and the Town of Hempstead Landmarks Preservation Committee.
