 cause  the substituting of one prescription drug for another in dispens-
 ing a prescription, or alter or cause the altering of  the  terms  of  a
 prescription, except with the approval of the prescriber or as explicit-
 ly required or permitted by law, including regulations of the department

 promulgate  regulations  to  determine when substitution of prescription
 drugs may be required or permitted.
  4.  Appeals.  A  pharmacy  benefit  manager  shall,  with  respect  to
 contracts between a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or, alterna-
 tively,  a  pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy's contracting agent,
 such as a  pharmacy  services  administrative  organization,  include  a
 reasonable process to appeal, investigate and resolve disputes regarding
 multi-source  generic  drug  pricing, INCLUDING BEING BELOW THE PHARMACY
 S. 950  4
 
 ACQUISITION COST.  The appeals  process  shall  include  the  following
 provisions:
  (a)  the  right  to  appeal  by  the  pharmacy  and/or  the pharmacy's
 contracting agent shall be limited to thirty days following the  initial
 claim submitted for payment;
  (b)  a  telephone  number through which a network pharmacy may contact
 the pharmacy benefit manager for the purpose of filing an appeal and  an
 electronic  mail  address of the individual who is responsible for proc-
 essing appeals;
  (c) the pharmacy benefit manager shall send an electronic mail message
 acknowledging receipt of the appeal. The pharmacy benefit manager  shall
 respond  in  an electronic message to the pharmacy and/or the pharmacy's
 contracting agent filing the appeal within seven business days  indicat-
 ing  its  determination.  If  the  appeal is determined to be valid, the
 maximum allowable cost for the drug shall be adjusted for the  appealing
 pharmacy effective as of the date of the original claim for payment. The
 pharmacy benefit manager shall require the appealing pharmacy to reverse
 and  rebill  the  claim  in  question  in  order to obtain the corrected
 reimbursement;
  (d) if an update to the maximum allowable cost is warranted, the phar-
 macy benefit manager or covered entity shall adjust the  maximum  allow-
 able cost of the drug effective for all similarly situated pharmacies in
 its  network  in  the  state on the date the appeal was determined to be
 valid; and
  (e) if an appeal is denied, the pharmacy benefit manager shall identi-
 fy the national drug code  of  a  therapeutically  equivalent  drug,  as
 determined  by  the federal Food and Drug Administration, that is avail-
 able for purchase by pharmacies in this state  from  wholesalers  regis-
 tered  pursuant to subdivision four of section sixty-eight hundred eight
 of the education law at a price which is equal to or less than the maxi-
 mum allowable cost for that drug as determined by the  pharmacy  benefit
 manager.
  4-A.  MAXIMUM  ALLOWABLE  COSTS.  (A) IF THE NATIONAL DRUG CODE NUMBER
 PROVIDED BY THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER  IS  NOT  AVAILABLE  BELOW  THE
 PHARMACY  ACQUISITION  COST FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALER FROM WHOM
 THE PHARMACY OR PHARMACIST PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS
 FOR  RESALE,  THEN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER SHALL ADJUST THE MAXIMUM
 ALLOWABLE COST ABOVE THE  CHALLENGING  PHARMACY'S  PHARMACY  ACQUISITION
 COST  AND  PERMIT THE PHARMACY TO REVERSE AND REBILL EACH CLAIM AFFECTED
 BY THE INABILITY TO PROCURE THE DRUG AT A COST THAT IS EQUAL TO OR  LESS
 THAN THE PREVIOUSLY CHALLENGED MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST.
  (B) A PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER SHALL NOT REIMBURSE A PHARMACY OR PHAR-
 MACIST  IN  THIS  STATE AN AMOUNT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT THE PHARMACY
 BENEFIT MANAGER REIMBURSES A  PHARMACY  BENEFIT  MANAGER  AFFILIATE  FOR
 PROVIDING THE SAME PHARMACIST SERVICES.
  (C)  THE  AMOUNT  SHALL BE CALCULATED ON A PER UNIT BASIS BASED ON THE
 SAME GENERIC PRODUCT IDENTIFIED OR GENERIC CODE NUMBER.
  (D) A PHARMACY OR PHARMACIST MAY DECLINE  TO  PROVIDE  THE  PHARMACIST
 SERVICES  TO  A PATIENT OR PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER IF, AS A RESULT OF A
 MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST, A PHARMACY OR PHARMACIST IS TO BE PAID LESS THAN
 THE PHARMACY ACQUISITION  COST  OF  THE  PHARMACY  PROVIDING  PHARMACIST
 SERVICES.
  5.  Contract  provisions.  No  pharmacy  benefit  manager  shall, with
 respect to contracts between such pharmacy benefit manager and a pharma-
 cy or, alternatively, such pharmacy benefit  manager  and  a  pharmacy's
 S. 950  5
 
 contracting  agent, such as a pharmacy services administrative organiza-
 tion:
  (a)  prohibit  or penalize a pharmacist or pharmacy from disclosing to
 an individual purchasing a prescription medication  information  regard-
 ing:
  (i) the cost of the prescription medication to the individual, or
  (ii)  the  availability  of any therapeutically equivalent alternative
 medications or alternative methods of purchasing the prescription  medi-
 cation, including but not limited to, paying a cash price; or
  (b)  charge or collect from an individual a copayment that exceeds the
 total submitted charges by the pharmacy for which the pharmacy is  paid.
 If an individual pays a copayment, the pharmacy shall retain the adjudi-
 cated  costs and the pharmacy benefit manager shall not redact or recoup
 the adjudicated cost.
  6. PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER  ADDITIONAL  DUTIES.  A  PHARMACY  BENEFIT
 MANAGER SHALL:
  (A)  PROVIDE ACCESS TO ITS MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST PRICES TO EACH PHAR-
 MACY SUBJECT TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST PRICE; AND
  (B) UPDATE ITS MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST PRICES ON A TIMELY BASIS, BUT IN
 NO EVENT LONGER THAN SEVEN CALENDAR DAYS FROM AN INCREASE OF TEN PERCENT
 OR MORE IN THE PHARMACY ACQUISITION COST FROM SIXTY PERCENT OR  MORE  OF
 THE PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALER DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OR A CHANGE IN
 THE METHODOLOGY ON WHICH THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST PRICE IS BASED OR IN
 THE VALUE OF A VARIABLE INVOLVED IN THE METHODOLOGY.
