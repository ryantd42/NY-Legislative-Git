  § 4. Subdivision 5 of section 400.00 of the penal law, as  amended  by
 chapter  1  of  the laws of 2013, subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (e) as
 amended by chapter 244 of the laws  of  2019,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  5.  Filing  of  approved  applications.  [(a)] The application for any
 license, if granted, shall be filed by the licensing  officer  with  the
 clerk  of  the  county  of issuance, except that in the city of New York
 and, in the counties of Nassau and Suffolk, the licensing officer  shall
 designate  the  place  of  filing in the appropriate division, bureau or
 unit of the police department thereof, and in the county of Suffolk  the
 county  clerk  is  hereby authorized to transfer all records or applica-
 tions relating to firearms to the licensing authority  of  that  county.
 [Except  as  provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this subdivision,
 the name and  address]  THE  APPLICATION  AND  ANY  SUPPORTING  RECORDS,
 INCLUDING  ANY  INFORMATION  CONTAINED THEREIN, of any person to whom an
 application for any license has been  granted  shall  NOT  be  a  public
 record AND SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SIX OF
 THE  PUBLIC OFFICERS LAW. Upon application by a licensee who has changed
 his OR HER place of residence such  records  or  applications  shall  be
 transferred  to  the  appropriate officer at the licensee's new place of
 residence. A duplicate copy of such application shall be  filed  by  the
 licensing  officer  in  the  executive  department,  division  of [state
 police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, Albany, within ten days  after  issu-
 ance of the license. The [superintendent] COMMISSIONER of [state police]
 CRIMINAL  JUSTICE  SERVICES may designate that such application shall be
 transmitted to the division of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE  SERVICES
 electronically.  In  the  event the [superintendent] COMMISSIONER of the
 division of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES determines that  it
 lacks  any of the records required to be filed with the division, it may
 request that such records be provided to it by  the  appropriate  clerk,
 department  or  authority  and such clerk, department or authority shall
 provide the division with such records. In the event such clerk, depart-
 ment or authority lacks such  records,  the  division  may  request  the
 license  holder provide information sufficient to constitute such record
 and such license holder shall provide the division  with  such  informa-
 tion.  Such  information  shall be limited to the license holder's name,
 date of birth, gender, race, residential address, social security number
 and firearms possessed by said license holder. Nothing in this  subdivi-
 sion  shall  be  construed to change the expiration date or term of such
 licenses  if  otherwise  provided  for  in  law.  Records  assembled  or
 collected  for purposes of inclusion in the database established by this
 section shall be released pursuant to a court order.  Records  assembled
 or  collected for purposes of inclusion in the database created pursuant
 S. 2338  3
 
 to section 400.02 of this [chapter] ARTICLE  shall  not  be  subject  to
 disclosure  pursuant  to  article  six of the public officers law EXCEPT
 THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS REGISTERED IN ANY COUNTY OF  THE  STATE
 MAY  BE  DISCLOSED  WITHOUT  ANY  OTHER  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT A
 REGISTRANT.
  [(b) Each application for a license pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this
 subdivision  shall  include,  on a separate written form prepared by the
 division of state police within thirty days of the effective date of the
 chapter of the  laws  of  two  thousand  thirteen,  which  amended  this
 section,  and provided to the applicant at the same time and in the same
 manner as the application for a license, an opportunity for  the  appli-
 cant  to  request  an  exception from his or her application information
 becoming public record pursuant to paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision.
 Such  forms,  which  shall also be made available to individuals who had
 applied for or been granted a license prior to the effective date of the
 chapter of the laws of two thousand thirteen which amended this section,
 shall notify applicants that, upon discovery that an applicant knowingly
 provided false information, such applicant may be subject  to  penalties
 pursuant to section 175.30 of this chapter, and further, that his or her
 request  for  an exception shall be null and void, provided that written
 notice containing such  determination  is  provided  to  the  applicant.
 Further, such forms shall provide each applicant an opportunity to spec-
 ify  the  grounds  on  which  he  or she believes his or her application
 information should not be publicly disclosed. These grounds, which shall
 be identified on the application with a box beside each for checking, as
 applicable, by the applicant, shall be as follows:
  (i) the applicant's life or safety may  be  endangered  by  disclosure
 because:
  (A)  the applicant is an active or retired police officer, peace offi-
 cer, probation officer, parole officer, or corrections officer;
  (B) the applicant is a protected person under a currently valid  order
 of protection;
  (C) the applicant is or was a witness in a criminal proceeding involv-
 ing a criminal charge;
  (D)  the  applicant  is  participating or previously participated as a
 juror in a criminal proceeding, or is or was a member of a  grand  jury;
 or
  (E) the applicant is a spouse, domestic partner or household member of
 a  person  identified  in this subparagraph or subparagraph (ii) of this
 paragraph, specifying which subparagraph or  subparagraphs  and  clauses
 apply.
  (ii) the applicant has reason to believe his or her life or safety may
 be endangered by disclosure due to reasons stated by the applicant.
  (iii)  the applicant has reason to believe he or she may be subject to
 unwarranted harassment upon disclosure of such information.
  (c) Each form provided for recertification pursuant to  paragraph  (b)
 of  subdivision ten of this section shall include an opportunity for the
 applicant to request an exception from the information provided on  such
 form  becoming  public record pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion. Such forms shall notify applicants that, upon  discovery  that  an
 applicant  knowingly  provided  false information, such applicant may be
 subject to penalties pursuant to section 175.30  of  this  chapter,  and
 further,  that  his  or  her  request for an exception shall be null and
 void, provided that written  notice  containing  such  determination  is
 provided to the applicant. Further, such forms shall provide each appli-
 cant  an opportunity to either decline to request the grant or continua-
 S. 2338  4

 tion of an exception, or specify the grounds on which he or she believes
 his or her information should not be publicly disclosed. These  grounds,
 which  shall be identified in the application with a box beside each for
 checking, as applicable, by the applicant, shall be the same as provided
 in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  (d)  Information  submitted on the forms described in paragraph (b) of
 this subdivision shall be excepted from disclosure and maintained by the
 entity retaining such information separate  and  apart  from  all  other
 records.
  (e)  (i)  Upon  receiving a request for exception from disclosure, the
 licensing officer shall grant such  exception,  unless  the  request  is
 determined to be null and void, pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this
 subdivision.
  (ii)  A  request  for an exception from disclosure may be submitted at
 any time, including after a license or recertification has been granted.
  (iii) If an exception is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph  (b)
 of  this  subdivision,  the  application information shall not be public
 record, unless the request is determined to be  null  and  void.  If  an
 exception is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdi-
 vision,  the  information  concerning  such  recertification application
 shall not be public record, unless the request is determined to be  null
 and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph,
 local  and  state law enforcement shall, upon request, be granted access
 to and copies of such application information provided that such  infor-
 mation  obtained  by law enforcement pursuant to this subparagraph shall
 not be considered a public record of such law enforcement agency.
  (f) The information of licensees or applicants for a license shall not
 be disclosed to the public during the  first  one  hundred  twenty  days
 following  the effective date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand
 thirteen, which amended this section. After such period, the information
 of those who had applied for or been granted  a  license  prior  to  the
 preparation  of  the form for requesting an exception, pursuant to para-
 graph (b) of this subdivision, may be released only if such  individuals
 did not file a request for such an exception during the first sixty days
 following  such  preparation;  provided,  however,  that  no information
 contained in an application for licensure or  recertification  shall  be
 disclosed  by  an  entity  that  has  not  completed processing any such
 requests received during such sixty days.
  (g) If a request for an exception is determined to be  null  and  void
 pursuant  to  paragraph (b) or (c) of this subdivision, an applicant may
 request review of such determination pursuant to  article  seventy-eight
 of  the  civil  practice  laws  and rules. Such proceeding must commence
 within thirty days after service of the written  notice  containing  the
 adverse  determination. Notice of the right to commence such a petition,
 and the time period therefor, shall be included in  the  notice  of  the
 determination.  Disclosure  following  such a petition shall not be made
 prior to the disposition of such review.]

 the  laws of 2013, subdivision (a) as amended by chapter 208 of the laws

 health professional currently providing treatment services to  a  person
 determines,  in  the  exercise of reasonable professional judgment, that
 such person is likely to engage in conduct that would result in  serious
 harm  to  self or others, he or she shall be required to report, as soon
 as practicable, to the director of community services, or the director's
 designee[, who shall report to the division of criminal justice services
 whenever he or she agrees that the person is likely to  engage  in  such
 conduct].  ANY REPORT MADE BY A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO THE DIREC-
 TOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES, OR  THE  DIRECTOR'S  DESIGNEE  SHALL  INCLUDE
 CURRENT  CONTACT  INFORMATION FOR SUCH PERSON INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO, THE PERSON'S: (1) NAME, (2) MAILING ADDRESS, (3)  PHONE  NUMBER  AND
 (4)  EMAIL ADDRESS. THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES OR THE DIRECTOR'S
 DESIGNEE SHALL REPORT TO THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES  UPON
 A  FINDING  THAT  THE  PERSON  IS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN CONDUCT THAT WOULD
 RESULT IN SERIOUS HARM TO SELF OR OTHERS. Information transmitted to the
 division of criminal justice services shall  be  limited  to  names  and
 other  non-clinical  identifying information, which may only be used for
 determining whether a license issued pursuant to section 400.00  of  the
 penal  law  should be suspended or revoked, or for determining whether a
 person is ineligible for a license issued pursuant to section 400.00  of
 the  penal  law, or is no longer permitted under state or federal law to
 possess a firearm.
  (c) THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY  SERVICES  OR  THE  DIRECTOR'S  DESIGNEE
 SHALL  INFORM SUCH PERSON VIA WRITTEN NOTICE WHEN A REPORT REGARDING THE
 SUBSTANTIAL RISK OR THREAT OF HARM POSED BY THE PERSON IS  SENT  TO  THE
 DIVISION  OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SERVICES. SUCH NOTICE SHALL INCLUDE, BUT
 NOT BE LIMITED TO:

 MENTAL HYGIENE OR THE NICS APPEALS OFFICE OF THE OFFICE FOR PEOPLE  WITH
 DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES; AND
  (6)  ANY  APPLICABLE  DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF A PETITION FOR RELIEF
 FROM DISABILITY.
  (D) Nothing in this section shall be construed  to  require  a  mental
 health professional to take any action which, in the exercise of reason-
 able  professional  judgment,  would endanger such mental health profes-
 sional or increase the danger to a potential victim or victims.
  [(d)] (E) The decision of a mental health professional to disclose  or
 not  to  disclose  in accordance with this section, when made reasonably
 S. 2338  6
 
 and in good faith, shall not be the basis  for  any  civil  or  criminal
 liability of such mental health professional.
  §  6.  Paragraph  2  of  subdivision (j) of section 7.09 of the mental
 hygiene law, as amended by chapter 1 of the laws of 2013, is amended  to
 read as follows:

 922(4)(d) or who has been or may be disqualified from continuing to have
 a license to carry, possess, repair,  or  dispose  of  a  firearm  under
 section  400.00  of  the penal law because such person was involuntarily
 committed or civilly confined to a facility under  the  jurisdiction  of
 the  commissioner,  OR WHO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A REPORT SUBMITTED BY
 THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES OR THE  DIRECTOR'S  DESIGNEE  TO  THE
 DIVISION  OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES STATING THAT THE NAMED PERSON HAS

 jurisdiction of the commissioner, OR WHO  HAS  BEEN  THE  SUBJECT  OF  A
 REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES OR THE DIRECTOR'S
 DESIGNEE  TO  THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES STATING THAT THE

 commissioner shall promulgate regulations to establish the  relief  from
 disabilities  program,  which  shall  include,  but  not  be limited to,

  § 8. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 and subdivisions 4, 7, 9, 10, 16-a
 and  16-b  of section 400.00 of the penal law, paragraph (a) of subdivi-

 subdivision 7 as separately amended by chapters 212 and 669 of the  laws

 2013  and  paragraph (a-1) of subdivision 16-a as added by chapter 98 of
 the laws of 2013, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) Applications shall be made and renewed, in the case of  a  license
 to  carry  or  possess  a  pistol  or  revolver  or  to purchase or take
 possession of a semiautomatic rifle, to the  licensing  officer  in  the
 city  or  county,  as  the  case may be, where the applicant resides, is
 principally employed or has his or her principal place  of  business  as
 merchant  or  storekeeper;  and, in the case of a license as gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms, to the licensing officer where such place  of  busi-
 ness  is  located.  Blank  applications shall, except in the city of New
 York, be approved as to form by the  [superintendent  of  state  police]
 DIVISION  OF  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES.  An application shall state the
 full name, date of birth, residence, present occupation of  each  person
 or individual signing the same, whether or not he or she is a citizen of
 the  United States, whether or not he or she complies with each require-
 ment for eligibility specified in subdivision one of  this  section  and
 such  other  facts as may be required to show the good character, compe-
 tency and integrity of each person or individual  signing  the  applica-
 tion. An application shall be signed and verified by the applicant. Each
 individual signing an application shall submit one photograph of himself
 or  herself  and  a duplicate for each required copy of the application.
 Such photographs shall have been  taken  within  thirty  days  prior  to
 filing  the  application.  In case of a license as gunsmith or dealer in
 firearms, the photographs submitted shall be two inches square, and  the
 application  shall also state the previous occupation of each individual
 signing the same and the location of the place of such business,  or  of
 the  bureau,  agency,  subagency,  office or branch office for which the
 license is sought, specifying the name of the  city,  town  or  village,
 indicating  the  street  and  number  and  otherwise  giving  such  apt
 description as to point out reasonably the  location  thereof.  In  such
 case,  if the applicant is a firm, partnership or corporation, its name,
 date and place of formation, and principal place of  business  shall  be
 stated.  For  such  firm or partnership, the application shall be signed
 and verified by each individual composing or intending  to  compose  the
 same, and for such corporation, by each officer thereof.
  4.  Investigation.  Before a license is issued or renewed, there shall
 be an investigation of all statements required in the application by the
 duly constituted police authorities of the locality where such  applica-
 tion is made, including but not limited to such records as may be acces-
 sible  to the division of [state police or division of] criminal justice
 services pursuant to section 400.02 of this article. For  that  purpose,
 the  records  of  the  appropriate  office  of  the department of mental
 hygiene concerning previous or present mental illness of  the  applicant
 shall  be  available  for inspection by the investigating officer of the
 police authority. Where the applicant is domiciled in a  foreign  state,
 the investigation shall include inquiry of the foreign state for records
 S. 2338  8
 
 concerning the previous or present mental illness of the applicant, and,
 to the extent necessary for inspection by the investigating officer, the
 applicant  shall  execute  a waiver of confidentiality of such record in
 such form as may be required by the foreign state. In order to ascertain
 any  previous  criminal record, the investigating officer shall take the
 fingerprints and physical descriptive  data  in  quadruplicate  of  each
 individual by whom the application is signed and verified. Two copies of
 such  fingerprints  shall  be  taken on standard fingerprint cards eight
 inches square, and one copy may be taken on a  card  supplied  for  that
 purpose  by the federal bureau of investigation; provided, however, that
 in the case of a corporate applicant that  has  already  been  issued  a
 dealer  in firearms license and seeks to operate a firearm dealership at
 a second or subsequent location, the original fingerprints on  file  may
 be  used  to  ascertain  any criminal record in the second or subsequent
 application unless any of the corporate officers have changed since  the
 prior  application, in which case the new corporate officer shall comply
 with procedures governing an initial application for such license.  When
 completed,  one  standard card shall be forwarded to and retained by the
 division of criminal justice services in the  executive  department,  at
 Albany.  A search of the files of such division and written notification
 of the results of the search shall be  forwarded  to  the  investigating
 officer  and  shall  be made without unnecessary delay. Thereafter, such
 division shall notify the licensing officer and  the  executive  depart-
 ment,  division  of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, Albany, of
 any criminal record of the applicant filed  therein  subsequent  to  the
 search  of its files. A second standard card, or the one supplied by the
 federal bureau of investigation, as the case may be, shall be  forwarded
 to that bureau at Washington with a request that the files of the bureau
 be searched and notification of the results of the search be made to the
 investigating  police authority. Of the remaining two fingerprint cards,
 one shall be filed with the executive  department,  division  of  [state
 police]  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SERVICES, Albany, within ten days after issu-
 ance of the license, and the other shall remain on file with the  inves-
 tigating  police authority. No such fingerprints may be inspected by any
 person other than a peace officer, who is acting pursuant to his or  her
 special  duties,  or  a  police  officer,  except on order of a judge or
 justice of a court of record either upon notice to the licensee or with-
 out  notice,  as  the  judge  or  justice  may  deem  appropriate.  Upon
 completion  of  the investigation, the police authority shall report the
 results to the licensing officer without unnecessary delay.
  7. License: form. Any license issued pursuant to this  section  shall,
 except  in  the  city of New York, be approved as to form by the [super-
 intendent of state police] DIVISION  OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE  SERVICES.  A
 license  to carry or possess a pistol or revolver or to purchase or take
 possession of a semiautomatic rifle shall have attached  the  licensee's
 photograph,  and  a  coupon  which  shall be removed and retained by any
 person disposing of a firearm to the licensee. A  license  to  carry  or
 possess  a  pistol or revolver shall specify the weapon covered by cali-
 bre, make, model, manufacturer's name and serial number, or if none,  by
 any  other distinguishing number or identification mark, and shall indi-
 cate whether issued to carry on the person or possess on  the  premises,
 and  if  on the premises shall also specify the place where the licensee
 shall possess the same. If such license is issued to a noncitizen, or to
 a person not a citizen of and usually  a  resident  in  the  state,  the
 licensing  officer  shall state in the license the particular reason for
 the issuance and the names of the persons certifying to the good charac-
 S. 2338  9
 
 ter of the applicant. Any license as  gunsmith  or  dealer  in  firearms
 shall mention and describe the premises for which it is issued and shall
 be valid only for such premises.
  9.  License:  amendment.  Elsewhere  than  in  the city of New York, a
 person licensed to carry or possess a pistol or revolver or to  purchase
 or take possession of a semiautomatic rifle may apply at any time to his
 or  her licensing officer for amendment of his or her license to include
 one or more such weapons or to cancel weapons  held  under  license.  If
 granted, a record of the amendment describing the weapons involved shall
 be  filed by the licensing officer in the executive department, division
 of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, Albany. The [superintendent

 for gunsmith or dealer in firearms and, in the city  of  New  York,  any
 license  to  carry  or  possess a pistol or revolver, issued at any time
 pursuant to this section or prior to the first  day  of  July,  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-three  and not limited to expire on an earlier date fixed
 in the license, shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)  of
 this  subdivision,  expire  not  more than three years after the date of

 pursuant to this section or prior to the first  day  of  July,  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-three  and not limited to expire on an earlier date fixed
 in the license, shall expire not more than five years after the date  of

 be certified prior to the first day of April, two thousand,  in  accord-
 ance  with  a schedule to be contained in regulations promulgated by the
 commissioner of the division of criminal  justice  services,  and  every
 such  license  shall,  except  as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of
 this subdivision,  be  recertified  every  five  years  thereafter.  For
 purposes  of  this  section  certification  shall mean that the licensee
 shall provide to the licensing officer the following  information  only:

 ber  and serial number of all firearms currently possessed. Such certif-
 ication information shall be filed by the licensing officer in the  same

 thereby extend the term of the license until disposition of the applica-
 tion  by the licensing officer. In the case of a license for gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms, in counties having a population  of  less  than  two
 hundred  thousand  inhabitants,  photographs  and  fingerprints shall be
 submitted on original applications and upon renewal thereafter at  three
 year  intervals. Upon satisfactory proof that a currently valid original
 license  has  been  despoiled,  lost  or  otherwise  removed  from  the
 possession of the licensee and upon application containing an additional
 photograph  of  the licensee, the licensing officer shall issue a dupli-
 cate license.
  (b) All licensees shall be  recertified  to  the  division  of  [state
 police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES every five years thereafter, except as
 otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  (d) of this subdivision. Any license

 sand thirteen which added this paragraph shall  be  recertified  by  the
 licensee  on  or before January thirty-first, two thousand eighteen, and
 not less than one year prior to such date, the [state  police]  DIVISION

 tial address, social security number, firearms possessed by such license

 TIONS FOR AMENDMENTS, THE LICENSING OFFICER SHALL RETAIN A COPY  OF  THE
 RECERTIFICATION  AND  A  COPY SHALL BE FILED BY THE LICENSING OFFICER IN
 THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, ALBANY,
 WITHIN TEN DAYS. The form may be in an electronic form if so  designated
 by  the  [superintendent  of  state police] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

 S. 2338  11
 
 result of the recertification process that a licensee failed to  provide
 a  change  of  address, the [New York state police] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SERVICES shall not require the licensing officer to revoke  such
 license.
  (c)  A license to purchase or take possession of a semiautomatic rifle
 as defined in subdivision two of this section shall  be  recertified  to
 the applicable licensing officer every five years following the issuance
 of  such  license.  Failure to renew such a license shall be a violation

 reviewing future license applications by the license holder pursuant  to
 this chapter.
  (d)  Licenses  issued  under  paragraph (f) of subdivision two of this
 section shall be recertified or renewed in the same form and  manner  as
 otherwise  required  by  this  subdivision,  provided however, that such
 licenses shall be recertified or renewed every three years following the
 issuance of such license. For licenses issued  prior  to  the  effective
 date  of  this paragraph that were issued more than three years prior to
 such date, or will expire in less than one year from such date shall  be
 recertified or renewed within one year of such date.
  16-a.  Registration. (a) An owner of a weapon defined in paragraph (e)
 or (f) of subdivision twenty-two of  section  265.00  of  this  chapter,
 possessed  before the date of the effective date of [the] chapter ONE of
 the laws of two thousand thirteen [which  added  this  paragraph],  must
 make  an application to register such weapon with the [superintendent of
 state police] DIVISION OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE  SERVICES,  in  the  manner
 provided  by the [superintendent] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES,
 or by amending a license issued pursuant to this section within one year
 of the effective date of this  subdivision  except  any  weapon  defined
 under  subparagraph  (vi)  of paragraph (g) of subdivision twenty-two of
 section 265.00 of this chapter transferred into the state may be  regis-
 tered  at  any  time, provided such weapons are registered within thirty
 days of their transfer into the state.  Registration  information  shall
 include  the registrant's name, date of birth, gender, race, residential
 address, social security number and a description of each  weapon  being
 registered. A registration of any weapon defined under subparagraph (vi)
 of  paragraph (g) of subdivision twenty-two of section 265.00 or a feed-
 ing device as defined under subdivision twenty-three of  section  265.00
 of this chapter shall be transferable, provided that the seller notifies
 the  [state  police] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES within seven-
 ty-two hours of the transfer and the buyer provides the  [state  police]
 DIVISION  OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE  SERVICES with information sufficient to
 constitute a registration under this section.  Such  registration  shall
 not be valid if such registrant is prohibited or becomes prohibited from
 possessing  a firearm pursuant to state or federal law. The [superinten-
 dent] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES shall determine whether such
 registrant is prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or feder-
 al law. Such check shall be limited to determining whether  the  factors
 in  18 USC 922 (g) apply or whether a registrant has been convicted of a
 serious offense as  defined  in  subdivision  [sixteen-b]  SEVENTEEN  of
 section  265.00  of this chapter, so as to prohibit such registrant from
 possessing a firearm, and whether a report has been issued  pursuant  to
 section  9.46 of the mental hygiene law. All registrants shall recertify
 to the division of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES  every  five
 years  thereafter.  Failure to recertify shall result in a revocation of
 such registration.

 the course of his or her official duties, and for which such officer was
 qualified  by the agency that employed such officer within twelve months
 prior to his or her retirement, must register such weapon  within  sixty

  (b)  The [superintendent of state police] DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

 tomatic  pistol  or weapon that are illegal as a result of the enactment
 of [the] chapter ONE of the laws of two thousand thirteen  [which  added
 this  paragraph],  as  well  as  such  assault weapons which are illegal
 pursuant to article two hundred sixty-five of this chapter. Such website
 shall contain information to assist the public in recognizing the  rele-
 vant features proscribed by such article two hundred sixty-five, as well
 as which make and model of weapons that require registration.
  (c)  A person who knowingly fails to apply to register such weapon, as
 required by this section, within one year of the effective date of [the]
 chapter ONE of the laws of two thousand thirteen [which added this para-
 graph] shall be guilty of a class A  misdemeanor  and  such  person  who
 unknowingly  fails  to validly register such weapon within such one year
 period shall be given  a  warning  by  an  appropriate  law  enforcement
 authority  about such failure and given thirty days in which to apply to
 register such weapon or to surrender it. A failure to apply or surrender
 such weapon within such thirty-day period shall result  in  such  weapon
 being removed by an appropriate law enforcement authority and declared a
 nuisance.
  16-b.  The cost of the software, programming and interface required to
 transmit any record that must be electronically transmitted by the deal-
 er or licensing officer to  the  division  of  [state  police]  CRIMINAL

 state.
  § 9. Section 400.02 of the penal law, as amended by chapter 371 of the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
 § 400.02 Statewide license and record database.
  1. There shall be a statewide license and record database which  shall
 be  created  and  maintained  by the division of [state police] CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SERVICES the cost of which shall not be  borne  by  any  munici-
 pality. Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in such
 database  shall  not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of
 the public officers law. All records containing granted license applica-
 tions from all licensing authorities shall be  monthly  checked  by  the
 division  of criminal justice services [in conjunction with the division
 of state  police]  against  criminal  conviction,  criminal  indictment,
 mental health, extreme risk protection orders, orders of protection, and
 all other records as are necessary to determine their continued accuracy
 as  well  as  whether an individual is no longer a valid license holder.
 The division of criminal  justice  services  shall  also  check  pending
 applications  made  pursuant  to  this  article  against such records to
 determine whether a license may be granted. All state and local agencies
 S. 2338  13
 
 shall cooperate with the  division  of  criminal  justice  services,  as
 otherwise  authorized by law, in making their records available for such
 checks. The division of criminal justice services, upon determining that
 an  individual  is  ineligible  to  possess a license, or is no longer a
 valid license holder, shall notify the applicable licensing official  of
 such determination and such licensing official shall not issue a license
 or  shall revoke such license and any weapons owned or possessed by such
 individual shall be removed consistent with the provisions  of  subdivi-
 sion  eleven  of  section  400.00  of  this article. Local and state law
 enforcement shall have access to such database  in  the  performance  of
 their  duties.  Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion
 in the database established by this section shall be  released  pursuant
 to a court order.
  2. There shall be a statewide license and record database specific for
 ammunition  sales  which shall be created and maintained by the division
 of [state police] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES the cost of which shall  not
 be  borne by any municipality no later than thirty days upon designating
 the division of state police as the point of  contact  to  perform  both
 firearm  and  ammunition  background checks under federal and state law.
 Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in  such  data-
 base  shall  not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the
 public officers law. All records containing granted license applications
 from all licensing authorities shall be monthly checked by the  division
 of  criminal justice services [in conjunction with the division of state
 police]  against  criminal  conviction,  criminal  indictments,  mental
 health,  extreme  risk  protection orders, orders of protection, and all
 other records as are necessary to determine their continued accuracy  as
 well  as  whether an individual is no longer a valid license holder. The
 division of criminal justice services shall also check pending  applica-
 tions  made  pursuant  to this article against such records to determine
 whether a license may be granted. All state  and  local  agencies  shall
 cooperate  with  the division of criminal justice services, as otherwise
 authorized by law, in making their records available for such checks. No
 later than thirty days after the [superintendent of  the  state  police]
 DIVISION certifies that the statewide license and record database estab-
 lished  pursuant  to  this  section and the statewide license and record
 database established  for  ammunition  sales  are  operational  for  the
 purposes  of  this  section,  a  dealer in firearms licensed pursuant to
 section 400.00 of this article, a seller of  ammunition  as  defined  in
 subdivision  twenty-four  of  section  265.00  of this chapter shall not
 transfer any ammunition to any other person  who  is  not  a  dealer  in
 firearms  as  defined  in  subdivision  nine of such section 265.00 or a
 seller of ammunition as defined in subdivision  twenty-four  of  section
 265.00 of this chapter, unless:
  (a)  before  the  completion  of  the transfer, the licensee or seller
 contacts the statewide license and  record  database  and  provides  the
 database  with  information sufficient to identify such dealer or seller
 transferee based on information on the transferee's identification docu-
 ment as defined in paragraph (c) of this subdivision,  as  well  as  the
 amount,  caliber, manufacturer's name and serial number, if any, of such
 ammunition;
  (b) the licensee or seller is provided with  a  unique  identification
 number; and
  (c)  the  transferor  has  verified  the identity of the transferee by
 examining a valid state identification document of the transferee issued
 by the department of motor vehicles or if the transferee is not a  resi-
 S. 2338  14

 dent of the state of New York, a valid identification document issued by
 the  transferee's  state or country of residence containing a photograph
 of the transferee.
  § 10. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that:
  1. section four of this act shall take effect on the first of November
 next succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law; and
  2.  sections  five, six and seven of this act shall take effect on the
