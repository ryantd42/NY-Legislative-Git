 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 163 of the state finance law is amended by adding

 CONTRACT  FOR CONSULTANT SERVICES WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO COST MORE THAN
 ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN A TWELVE MONTH  PERIOD  THE  STATE  AGENCY  SHALL
 CONDUCT A COST COMPARISON REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SERVICES TO BE
 PROVIDED  BY  THE  CONSULTANT CAN BE PERFORMED AT EQUAL OR LOWER COST BY
 UTILIZING  STATE  EMPLOYEES,  UNLESS  THE  CONTRACT  MEETS  ONE  OF  THE
 EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH G OF THIS SUBDIVISION. AS USED IN THIS
 SECTION,  THE TERM "CONSULTANT SERVICES" SHALL MEAN ANY CONTRACT ENTERED
 INTO BY A STATE AGENCY FOR  ANALYSIS,  EVALUATION,  RESEARCH,  TRAINING,

 TRATIVE  SALARIES  AND  BENEFITS,  RENT,  EQUIPMENT COSTS, UTILITIES AND

 ESTIMATED COST FOR THE ANTICIPATED TERM OF THE CONTRACT.
  B. PRIOR TO ENTERING ANY CONSULTATION SERVICES CONTRACT FOR THE PRIVA-
 TIZATION OF A STATE SERVICE THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY PRIVATIZED, THE  STATE
 AGENCY  SHALL  DEVELOP  A  COST COMPARISON REVIEW IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION.

 SUCH CONTRACT AND TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL RESULTS,  EFFECTIVENESS  AND
 EFFICIENCY OF SUCH CONTRACT.
  (II)  IF SUCH COST COMPARISON REVIEW IDENTIFIES A COST SAVINGS OF LESS

 CONTRACT AND TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL RESULTS, EFFECTIVENESS AND  EFFI-
 CIENCY  OF  SUCH CONTRACT, PROVIDED THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC POLICY
 REASON TO ENTER INTO SUCH CONSULTANT SERVICES CONTRACT.

 REASONABLE RESOURCES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENCOURAGING AND  ASSISTING  SUCH
 STATE  EMPLOYEES  TO  ORGANIZE  AND SUBMIT A BID TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES

 CAUSE.

 TED BY A STATE AGENCY WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF  RECEIPT  OF  SUCH  BUSINESS
 PLAN, SUCH BUSINESS PLAN SHALL BE DEEMED APPROVED.
