 Introduced  by  Sen. MAYER -- (at request of the State Education Depart-
  ment) -- read twice and  ordered  printed,  and  when  printed  to  be
  committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the education law, in relation to continuing the New
  York State Smart Scholars Early College High School  Program  and  the
  New  York  State  Pathways  in  Technology  Early  College High School
  Program in this state
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares it necessary to preserve and continue the New York State  Smart
 Scholars  early college high school program and the New York state path-
 ways in technology early college high school  program  (P-TECH  program)
 which  provide various students, including those traditionally underrep-
 resented in post-secondary education, with  the  opportunity  to  access
 college-level  courses  and  college  degree  credits  and  career
 preparation/readiness opportunities at the high school  level  with  the
 combined support of high school and college staff and resources, and for
 P-TECH  programs, career training and employment in a highly skilled job
 upon completion of the program. The New York State Smart Scholars  early
 college high school program not only increases students' access to high-
 er  education, but also reduces potential costs for students in complet-
 ing college degrees by allowing them to either complete  a  degree  upon
 graduation  from  high  school  or to apply their earned college credits
 towards  an  associate's  or  baccalaureate's  degree.  This  innovative
 program  provides  incentives  to  high  school  students  to proceed to
 college and to earn a  college  degree  by  accelerating  their  overall
 completion  of  a degree. It also better prepares them for college-level
 coursework, which, will in turn, increase  their  academic  performance.
 Ultimately,  this  program  increases  graduation rates both at the high
 school and college levels, especially for academically at-risk students.

  The New York State P-TECH program, through a  public-private  partner-
 ship, prepares thousands of New York students for high-skill jobs of the
 future  in  fields  including,  but not limited to, science, technology,
 engineering,  manufacturing,  healthcare,  except  for  the  licensed
 professions  under  Title  VIII  of  the  education law unless otherwise
 determined by the commissioner of education,  finance  and  math-related
 career areas. The New York State P-TECH program provides students with a
 rigorous, relevant and cost-free high school and college education and a
 workplace  learning  environment with ongoing mentoring by professionals
 in the chosen  career  sector  to  better  prepare  these  students  for
 successful  careers. Students also receive a commitment from the partic-
 ipating employer to be first in  line  for  an  opportunity  for  a  job
 following completion of the program.  Ultimately, this program increases
 graduation rates both at the high school and college levels and provides
 essential  career  training  for  academically  at-risk,  disadvantaged
 students, which at the completion  of  the  program  improves  students'
 readiness for employment in a 21st century workplace.
  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and  declares it necessary to provide
 funding for these programs to ensure that they continue in operation and
 continue to provide students with these valuable services. The  legisla-
 ture  also finds and declares it necessary to provide additional funding
 for the state education department  to  administer  and  evaluate  these
 critical  programs. These funds will support program staff to supplement
 the oversight already being provided to these programs, and  ensure  the
 timely  and  accurate  analysis  of data to further enhance and validate
 these programs.
