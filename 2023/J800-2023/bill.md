and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Victor  Farmington  Volunteer  Ambulance  Corps  is a
dedicated emergency unit providing life-saving care and transport to the

and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  membership of dedicated volunteers, the record of
the Victor Farmington Volunteer Ambulance Corps in  public  service  and
emergency  medical services is one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, 365
days a year, for 50 years,  whenever  the  alarm  sounded,  these  noble

Corps  reflects  the  history and development of ambulance and emergency
medical service over the past 50 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility their own by
serving as volunteer emergency medical services providers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment of their communities and acknowledge publicly the heroic good
works  performed by the volunteer ambulance workers of this great Empire
State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the  Victor Farmington
Volunteer Ambulance Corps to be celebrated retroactive to July 2,  2020,
on October 24, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
