 WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBSECTION (H) OF

 EQUAL TO THE SUM OF (I) THE GREATER OF (I) THE BALANCE  OF  ITS  FEDERAL
 RESERVE FOR LOSSES ON QUALIFYING REAL PROPERTY LOANS AS OF THE FIRST DAY
 OF THE FIRST TAXABLE YEAR THE TAXPAYER BECOMES SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
 OF  THIS  SUBSECTION OR (II) THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNTS DETERMINED UNDER
 SUBPARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) OF PARAGRAPH NINE OF SUBSECTION  (H)  OF  THIS
 SECTION  IN  THE  YEAR  SUCH PARAGRAPH APPLIED TO THE TAXPAYER, (II) THE

 BECOMES  SUBJECT  TO THIS SUBSECTION OR (II) THE BALANCE IN ITS NEW YORK
 RESERVE FOR LOSSES ON NONQUALIFYING  LOANS  AS  OF  THE  LAST  DATE  THE
 TAXPAYER WAS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBSECTION (H) OF THIS SECTION

 INCLUDING  ANY  ADDITIONS  THERETO, SUBTRACTIONS THEREFROM, OR RECAPTURE

 COVERED BY THE RETURN TO SUCH DEPARTMENT. IF IT SHALL APPEAR  THAT  SUCH
 METHOD OF DETERMINING ENTIRE NET INCOME OR ALTERNATIVE ENTIRE NET INCOME
 DOES  NOT  PROPERLY  REFLECT  THE  TAXPAYER'S  INCOME  DURING THE PERIOD
 COVERED BY THE RETURN UNDER THIS  ARTICLE,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  BE
 AUTHORIZED  IN HIS OR HER DISCRETION TO DETERMINE SUCH ENTIRE NET INCOME
 OR ALTERNATIVE ENTIRE NET INCOME SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF  THE  TAXPAYER'S
