 AN ACT authorizing the Grace Gospel Church of Suffolk to file an  appli-
  cation for retroactive real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Brookhaven in the county of Suffolk is here-
 by authorized to accept from Grace Gospel Church of  Suffolk,  Inc.,  an
 application  for  exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section
 420-a of the real property tax law with respect to  the  2020--2021  and
 2021--2022  assessment rolls for the parcels owned by such organization,
 with such parcels being located at 230 Falcon Avenue, in the village  of
 Patchogue,  town  of  Brookhaven,  county of Suffolk, otherwise known as
 Suffolk county tax map district 0200, section 975.40, block  03.00,  lot
 050.000.  If  accepted,  the  application shall be reviewed as if it had
 been received on or before the taxable status dates established for such
 rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the town board, may grant exemption
 from all taxation beginning on the date of the conveyance of such parcel
 to such organization, and make appropriate corrections  to  the  subject
 rolls.  If  such  exemption  is  granted and such organization therefore
 shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the governing
 body or tax department may, in its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the
 refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and  cancel any taxes, fines, penalties,
 interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
