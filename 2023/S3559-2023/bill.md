 each applicant shall furnish to the commissioner a surety  bond  in  the
 sum  of  [five] TWENTY-FIVE thousand dollars, payable to the city of New
 York, executed by the applicant and a surety approved by the commission-

 administered by the comptroller and authorize an applicant for a license
 to  engage  in  towing  to,  in  lieu of a bond or cash equivalent, make
 contributions to such fund to satisfy the requirements of subdivision  a
 of  this  section.  The  commissioner may promulgate such rules or regu-
 lations as are necessary for the administration of such fund  including,
 but not limited to, regulations setting forth the conditions for partic-
 ipation  in the fund, the contributions required to be made to the fund,
 INCLUDING THE CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING  THE  APPROPRIATE

 ments will be made from the fund.
