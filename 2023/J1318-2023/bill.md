  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 19-25, 2023, as Pollinator Week in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  that  are  set  aside  to increase awareness of serious
issues which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  19-25,  2023,  as
Pollinator  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Pollinator Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, This week marks the national  celebration  of  pollinators,
vital partners to our Nation's food system, economy, and ecosystem; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pollinator species, such as bats, birds, bees, butterflies,
moths,  and  other  insects,  play an essential role in facilitating the
production of much of our food supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Healthy  pollinator  populations  are  critical  to  the
continued  ecological wellness of our agricultural system as well as the
economic prosperity of our farming and ranching communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 100 United States grown crops rely on pollination
from honey bees and other insects that collectively  ensure  we  have  a
variety  of  fruits, nuts, and vegetables to support a healthy, balanced
diet; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honey bees are  America's  primary  commercial  pollinator,
although  there  are  more than 4,000 types of bee species in the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pollinators  are  integral  to  our  National  Forests  and
grasslands,  which  provide forage, fish, wildlife, timber, water, other
resources, and recreational opportunities for United States communities;
they provide significant environmental benefits necessary  for  healthy,
biodiverse ecosystems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pollinator health is important to the well-being of United
States agriculture, food security, and the Nation's overall economy; the
United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  invests  in  and  supports
pollinator health and conservation stewardship, including protecting and
maintaining their habitats on working lands and wildland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  and  every  American  can  do  their part to protect
pollinator species by incorporating pollinator-friendly practices,  like
growing  pollinator-attractive  flowering  trees  and plants at home, in
community gardens, or installing  pollinator  habitats  on  farms;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  19-25,  2023,  as
Pollinator Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
