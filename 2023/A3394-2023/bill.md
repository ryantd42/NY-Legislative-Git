 AN ACT to amend the education law,  in  relation  to  apportionment  for
  capital  outlays  and  debt  service  for  school building purposes to
  certain high need school districts

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraphs  1 and 3 of paragraph a of subdivision 6 of
 section 3602 of the education law, as amended by section 5 of part A  of
 chapter 60 of the laws of 2000, are amended to read as follows:
  (1)  For new construction and the purchase of existing structures, the
 cost allowances shall be based upon the rated capacity of  the  building
 or  addition and a basic per pupil allowance of up to six thousand three
 hundred seventy-five dollars  adjusted  monthly  by  a  statewide  index
 reflecting  changes in the cost of labor and materials since July first,
 nineteen hundred ninety-two, established by the commissioner  of  labor,
 modified by an annual county or multi-county labor market composite wage
 rate,  established by the commissioner of labor in consultation with the
 commissioner, for July first of the base year,  commencing  July  first,
 nineteen hundred ninety-seven for general construction contracts awarded
 on  or  after  July first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, indexed to the
 median of such county or multi-county rates, but not less than one.  FOR
 AID  PAYABLE  IN  SCHOOL YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE--TWENTY-FOUR AND
 THEREAFTER, FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCATED IN COUNTIES WITH  A  POPULATION
 OF  MORE  THAN  NINE  HUNDRED  FORTY  THOUSAND AND LESS THAN ONE MILLION
 INHABITANTS ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND TEN  FEDERAL  CENSUS  AND  ARE
 ELIGIBLE FOR AID PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (C) OF SUBPARAGRAPH TWO OF PARAGRAPH
 C  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, SUCH AID SHALL BE ADJUSTED BY THE ANNUAL COUNTY
 LABOR MARKET COMPOSITE WAGE RATE OF THE CITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  OF  SUCH
 CITY  HAVING  A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE INHABITANTS. Such base
 allowance shall apply to a building or an addition housing grades  prek-

 indergarten through six and shall be adjusted for a building or an addi-
 tion  housing  grades  seven  through  nine by a factor of one and four-
 tenths, for a building or  an  addition  housing  grades  seven  through
 twelve  by  a  factor of one and five-tenths, for a building or addition
 housing special education programs by a factor of two, except that where
 such building or addition is connected to,  or  such  space  is  located
 within,  a  public  school  facility  housing  programs  for nondisabled
 pupils, as approved by the commissioner, a  factor  of  three  shall  be
 used. Rated capacity of a building or an addition shall be determined by
 the  commissioner  based  on  space standards and other requirements for
 building construction specified by  the  commissioner.  Such  assigned
 capacity ratings shall include, in addition to those spaces used for the
 instruction  of  pupils,  those spaces which are used for elementary and
 secondary school libraries,  cafeterias,  prekindergarten  instructional
 rooms,  teachers'  conference rooms, gymnasiums and auditoriums. For new
 construction projects approved on or after July first, two thousand,  by
 the voters of the school district or by the board of education of a city
 school  district  in a city with more than one hundred twenty-five thou-
 sand inhabitants, and/or the chancellor in a city school district  in  a
 city having a population of one million or more, such rated capacity for
 new  buildings  and  additions constructed to replace existing buildings
 that, in the judgment of the  commissioner,  have  not  been  adequately
 maintained  and  have  not  reached their projected useful life shall be
 reduced by the commissioner by an amount proportional to  the  remaining
 unused  portion  of  the useful life of the existing buildings, provided
 however that the commissioner may waive such requirement upon a  finding
 that  replacement  of  the existing building is necessary to protect the
 health and safety of students or staff, that reconstruction and  modern-
 ization  of  the  existing  building  would  not adequately address such
 health and safety problems, and that the need to  replace  the  building
 was  not  caused  by failure to adequately maintain the building. If the
 commissioner of labor resets the statewide index reflecting  changes  in
 the  costs  of  labor  and  materials since July first, nineteen hundred
 ninety-two, the commissioner shall adopt regulations  to  supersede  the
 basic  per  pupil allowance of up to six thousand three hundred seventy-
 five dollars to the imputed allowance in effect at that time.
  (3) Cost allowances for reconstructing or modernizing structures shall
 not exceed one hundred per centum of the cost allowances for the  equiv-
 alent  new  construction over the projected useful life of the building,
 to be determined in accordance with the regulations of the commissioner.
 Reconstruction projects shall reasonably meet the  criteria  established
 for  new  construction,  including  but  not  limited  to  energy, fire,
 personal safety and space per pupil standards. FOR AID PAYABLE IN SCHOOL
 YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE--TWENTY-FOUR AND THEREAFTER,  FOR  SCHOOL
 DISTRICTS  LOCATED  IN  COUNTIES  WITH  A  POPULATION  OF MORE THAN NINE
 HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AND LESS THAN ONE MILLION  INHABITANTS  ACCORDING
 TO THE TWO THOUSAND TEN FEDERAL CENSUS AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AID PURSUANT
 TO  CLAUSE  (C)  OF SUBPARAGRAPH TWO OF PARAGRAPH C OF THIS SUBDIVISION,
 SUCH AID SHALL BE ADJUSTED BY THE ANNUAL COUNTY LABOR  MARKET  COMPOSITE
 WAGE  RATE  OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT OF SUCH CITY HAVING A POPULATION
 OF ONE MILLION OR MORE INHABITANTS.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
