  proxy information on driver's licenses

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 504 of the  vehi-
 cle  and  traffic  law, as separately amended by chapters 568 and 639 of
 the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  (a) Every license or renewal thereof shall  contain  a  distinguishing
 mark  and  adequate  space  upon  which  an anatomical gift, pursuant to
 section forty-three hundred ten of the public health law, by the  licen-
 see shall be recorded and shall contain such other information and shall
 be  issued  in  such form as the commissioner shall determine; provided,
 however, every license or renewal thereof issued to a person  under  the
 age  of  twenty-one  years  shall have prominently imprinted upon it the
 statement "UNDER 21 YEARS  OF  AGE"  in  notably  distinctive  print  or
 format;  provided  further,  however,  every  license or renewal thereof
 issued to a person making an  anatomical  gift  shall  have  prominently
 printed  upon the front of such license or renewal thereof the statement
 "ORGAN DONOR" in notably  distinctive  print  or  format;  AND  PROVIDED
 FURTHER  THAT  EVERY  LICENSE  SHALL HAVE IMPRINTED ON THE BACK, "IF YOU
 HAVE COMPLETED A HEALTH CARE PROXY FORM, YOU MAY LIST YOUR  HEALTH  CARE
 AGENT  HERE:"  FOLLOWED  BY SPACE FOR THE HEALTH CARE AGENT'S NAME AND
 CONTACT INFORMATION. The commissioner shall not  require  fees  for  the
 issuance  of  such licenses or renewals thereof to persons under twenty-
 one years of age or to persons  making  an  anatomical  gift  which  are
 different  from  the  fees  required  for  the  issuance  of licenses or
 renewals thereof to persons twenty-one  years  of  age  or  over  or  to
 persons not making an anatomical gift.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
