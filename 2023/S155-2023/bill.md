 AN  ACT  to amend the general construction law, in relation to requiring
  the use of gender-neutral terms in law

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  22  of the general construction law, as added by
 chapter 730 of the laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  § 22. Gender. Whenever words  of  the  masculine  or  feminine  gender
 appear  in any law, rule or regulation, unless the sense of the sentence
 indicates otherwise, they shall be deemed to  refer  to  [both  male  or
 female]  persons  OF ANY GENDER. This construction shall apply to gender
 indicative suffixes or prefixes as well as to gender  indicative  words.
 Whenever  the  reference is to a corporation, board, body, group, organ-
 ization or other entity comprising more than one person or to an  assem-
 blage  of  persons  or  to  an  inanimate  object the reference shall be
 construed to be neuter in gender.  HEREAFTER, IN ANY  LAW,  RULE,  REGU-
 LATION,  ORDINANCE  OR  RESOLUTION, GENDERED TERMS SHALL NOT BE USED AND
 GENDER-NEUTRAL TERMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO  "THEY",  "THEM"  AND
 "THEIRS", SHALL BE USED IN SUBSTITUTION THEREFOR AND WITH THE SAME FORCE
 AND  EFFECT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF SUCH LAW, RULE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE
 OR RESOLUTION IS IN REFERENCE TO A SPECIFIC PERSON, THE LANGUAGE  REFER-
 RING  TO  SUCH  PERSON  SHALL  BE GENDERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENDER
 IDENTITY OF SUCH PERSON.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
