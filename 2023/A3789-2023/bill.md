 AN ACT to amend the state law, in relation to designating rescue cats as
  the official state cat
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative intent. Since their domestication some tens of
 thousands  of  years  ago,  cats and their human counterparts have lived
 happily side by side, each providing a lifetime of  love,  companionship
 and loyalty to the other. Early civilizations revered the cat as sacred,
 capable  of vanquishing evil spirits. Still others cherished the cat for
 its ability to protect property from insects and  vermin.  While  modern
 day cats may have lost some of their mythic stature, they certainly have
 not  lost  any  of their appeal. Cats have become the most popular house
 pet in the United States, with 90 million felines living in 34%  of  all
 households. There are few things as calming in this world as a curled-up
 cat meowing peacefully in one's lap.
  Cats  offer  their  humans  countless hours of companionship and love,
 provide protection against loneliness and depression, and  their  antics
 are  oftentimes  capable of bringing one to tears with laughter.  All of
 this they offer, and ask only for a loving caretaker  who  will  provide
 them shelter and food in return. Any cat owner will tell you that no one
 owns  a  cat,  but  despite  their  fearless independence, cats need our
 protection.
  The ASPCA estimates that there are roughly between 60 and 100  million
 stray or feral cats in the United States alone. Each year, an additional
 six  to  eight  million  animals enter the shelter system. Of those, one
 animal is euthanized every eight seconds, meaning that approximately 70%
 of all cats that enter the shelter system are euthanized.
  Legislation to name the "rescue cat" New York state's  official  state
 cat  will  help  educate and raise awareness about the plight of animals

 that enter the shelter system. These animals, most of which are given up
 through no fault of their own, are perceived as  "damaged".  As  shelter
 populations soar, these innocent animals face an ever-increasing risk of
 euthanasia.
  These  deaths  can  be  prevented  through  adoption.  Rescue cats are
 desperate for a second chance, and want  nothing  more  than  to  become
 loving members of the family. Designating the rescue cat as the official
 cat  of  New York state will help prevent the senseless killing of thou-
 sands of cats each year by raising awareness of the overpopulation prob-
 lem and promoting adoption through education and awareness.
  § 2.  The state law is amended by adding a new section 79-a to read as
 follows:
  § 79-A. STATE CAT. THE RESCUE CAT SHALL BE THE  OFFICIAL  CAT  OF  THE
 STATE OF NEW YORK. AS USED IN THIS SECTION "RESCUE CAT" SHALL MEAN A CAT
 OF  ANY  BREED  OR  MIXTURE OF BREEDS RESCUED AND ADOPTED FROM AN ANIMAL
 SHELTER OR RESCUE GROUP LOCATED IN THE STATE.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
