  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 24, 2023, as Ukrainian-American Heritage  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, In full accord  with  its  long-standing  traditions,  this
Legislative Body is justly proud to memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to
proclaim,  Thursday, August 24, 2023, as Ukrainian-American Heritage Day
in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
Ukrainian Independence Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ukraine  Independence  Day  took place on August 24, 1991,
marking the Ukraine's declaration of independence from the U.S.S.R; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the 2020 census, the Ukrainian  population  in
the  United  States  is over one million; in addition, New York State is
the state with  the  highest  Ukrainian  population  with  approximately
140,000 New Yorkers claiming Ukrainian heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  continued attacks from Russia on Ukraine, it is
imperative that we acknowledge the importance of Ukrainian Heritage  and
Independence;  New  York  State has also served as a place of refuge for
those seeking safety from this conflict; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of how important this issue  is,  especially
to  New York, the federal government has granted the state $21.4 million
to help with the  resettlement  of  Ukrainian  refugees;  these  factors
combined provide the justification for a Ukrainian Heritage/Independence
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the  local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  24,  2023,  as
Ukrainian-American  Heritage  Day  in  the  State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church in Yonkers, New York;  and
the SUMA Federal Credit Union office in Yonkers, New York.
