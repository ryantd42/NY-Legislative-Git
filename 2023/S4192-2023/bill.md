 PROCEEDINGS  IN  THE  SUPREME  COURT  IS  NECESSARY, TO CAUSE THE PROPER
 PROCEEDINGS TO BE COMMENCED AND PROSECUTED, AT  ANY  TIME  AFTER  THIRTY
 DAYS  FROM  THE DATE OF THE SEIZURE, TO DECLARE SUCH FORFEITURE, UNLESS,
 UPON  INQUIRY  AND  EXAMINATION,  SUCH  DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR CORPORATION
 COUNSEL DECIDES THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS CAN NOT PROBABLY BE  SUSTAINED  OR
 THAT  THE  ENDS  OF  PUBLIC  JUSTICE  DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THEY SHOULD BE
 INSTITUTED OR PROSECUTED, IN WHICH CASE, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR CORPO-
 RATION COUNSEL SHALL CAUSE SUCH SEIZED PROPERTY TO BE  RETURNED  TO  THE
 OWNER THEREOF.
  4.  NOTICE  OF  THE  INSTITUTION OF THE FORFEITURE PROCEEDING SHALL BE
 SERVED EITHER (A) PERSONALLY ON THE OWNERS OF THE  SEIZED  PROPERTY,  OR
 (B) BY REGISTERED MAIL TO THE OWNERS' LAST KNOWN ADDRESS AND BY PUBLICA-
 TION  OF  THE NOTICE ONCE A WEEK FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE WEEKS IN A NEWSPAPER
 PUBLISHED OR CIRCULATED IN THE COUNTY WHEREIN THE SEIZURE WAS MADE.
  5. FORFEITURE SHALL NOT BE ADJUDGED  WHERE  THE  OWNERS  ESTABLISH  BY
 PREPONDERANCE  OF THE EVIDENCE THAT (A) THE USE OF SUCH SEIZED PROPERTY,
 IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 165.71, 165.72, OR 165.73 OF THIS TITLE, WAS NOT
 INTENTIONAL ON THE PART OF ANY OWNER, OR (B) SUCH  SEIZED  PROPERTY  WAS
 USED IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 165.71, 165.72, OR 165.73 OF THIS TITLE, BY
 ANY  PERSON  OTHER THAN AN OWNER THEREOF, WHILE SUCH SEIZED PROPERTY WAS
 UNLAWFULLY IN THE POSSESSION OF A PERSON WHO ACQUIRED POSSESSION THEREOF
 IN VIOLATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES, OR OF ANY STATE.
  6. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT  HAVING  CUSTODY  OF
 THE  SEIZED  PROPERTY,  AFTER SUCH JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF FORFEITURE,
 SHALL, AT THEIR DISCRETION, EITHER RETAIN SUCH SEIZED PROPERTY  FOR  THE
 OFFICIAL USE OF THEIR OFFICE OR DEPARTMENT, OR, BY A PUBLIC NOTICE OF AT
 LEAST  FIVE  DAYS,  SELL SUCH FORFEITED PROPERTY AT PUBLIC SALE. THE NET
 PROCEEDS OF ANY SUCH  SALE,  AFTER  DEDUCTION  OF  THE  LAWFUL  EXPENSES
 INCURRED,  SHALL BE PAID INTO THE GENERAL FUND OF THE COUNTY WHEREIN THE
 SEIZURE WAS MADE.

 DECLARED  FORFEITED  UNDER  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION FILES WITH A
 JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME  COURT  A  PETITION  FOR  THE  RECOVERY  OF  SUCH
 FORFEITED  PROPERTY,  THE  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT MAY RESTORE SUCH
 FORFEITED PROPERTY UPON SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS  HE  OR  SHE  DEEMS
 REASONABLE  AND JUST, IF THE PETITIONER ESTABLISHES EITHER OF THE AFFIR-
 MATIVE DEFENSES SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION  AND  THAT

 TURE PROCEEDING. IF  THE  PETITION  IS  FILED  AFTER  THE  SALE  OF  THE

 LIMITED TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF SUCH SALE AFTER DEDUCTION OF  THE  LAWFUL
 EXPENSES  AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, POLICE DEPARTMENT
 OR CORPORATION COUNSEL.
