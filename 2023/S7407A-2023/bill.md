  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary

 current impacted population is summarized below.

 S. 7407--A  3
 
  BACKGROUND: Mr. Smith retired with an Ordinary  Disability  Retirement
 from  POLICE on August 12, 2009. He currently receives an annual pension
 of $68,150 per year payable under the maximum  form  of  payment  (i.e.,
 payable to him as long as he is alive).
  If  the proposed legislation is enacted, Mr. Smith's retirement allow-
 ance would be recalculated as an Accident Disability Retirement and  his
 annual  pension would increase to $113,397 per year. This increase would
 apply prospectively as well as retroactively, to  Mr.  Smith's  original
 date of retirement.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  For  purposes  of calculating the fiscal impact of the proposed legis-
 lation, it has been assumed that the increase in  benefits  for  periods
 prior to June 30, 2024 would not be credited with interest.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 ment  Systems  and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only
 during the 2024 Legislative Session.
