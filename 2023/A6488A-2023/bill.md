  §  138-B.  VISITING POLICIES FOR THE INCARCERATED. 1.  STATE AND LOCAL

 THAT IS EQUITABLE WITH DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY THE
 VISITOR, THE FREQUENCY OF THE VISITOR'S VISITS, THE MOST RECENT OCCASION
 THAT THE INCARCERATED PERSON'S VISIT WAS TERMINATED DUE TO OVERCROWDING,
 AND ANY OTHER  INDIVIDUAL  CIRCUMSTANCES  THAT  LIMIT  IN-PERSON  VISITS

 ANY PERSON.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
