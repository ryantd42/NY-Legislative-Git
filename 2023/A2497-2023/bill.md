  M. of A. COOK, SIMON -- read once and referred  to  the  Committee  on
  Real Property Taxation
 
 AN  ACT to amend the public health law and the real property tax law, in
  relation to authorizing real property taxing jurisdictions to grant  a
  tax  exemption  for  a primary residence purchased by a clinician in a
  clinician shortage area; and to amend the real property  tax  law,  in
  relation  to providing state aid to such jurisdictions for the savings
  granted by such exemption
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby
 finds that several communities  within  the  state,  particularly  those
 located  within  rural  areas, lack adequate access to clinicians. It is
 well established that ensuring the  sufficient  availability  of  physi-
 cians,  physician  assistants,  nurse  practitioners, and nurse midwives
 directly benefits the health of state residents, and the legislature has
 enacted several measures towards that end.
  Furthermore, the legislature finds that municipalities are often  best
 situated  to  evaluate  the needs of their communities. Therefore, it is
 the intent of the legislature to offer counties, cities, towns, villages
 and school districts the option to provide real property tax exemptions,
 should they determine that such an incentive  would  aid  in  attracting
 clinicians to areas currently underserved by the medical community.
  §  2.  Section 206 of the public health law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 32 to read as follows:
  32. (A) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL BIENNIALLY DESIGNATE AND MAKE AVAILABLE
 A LIST OF DESIGNATED CLINICIAN SHORTAGE AREAS IN THE STATE. A DESIGNATED
 CLINICIAN SHORTAGE AREA SHALL BE A COUNTY OR OTHER SUB-COUNTY GEOGRAPHIC
 AREA DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER TO BE IN SHORT SUPPLY OF  CLINICIANS
 IN  PRIMARY  CARE  PRACTICE AND/OR ONE OR MORE MEDICAL SPECIALITIES. THE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 PHYSICIANS AND WHICH MEDICAL SPECIALTY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE  DESIG-
 NATED  SHORTAGE  AREA,  PHYSICIAN  ASSISTANTS,  NURSE PRACTITIONERS, AND
 NURSE MIDWIVES.
  (B) IN ESTABLISHING DESIGNATED CLINICIAN SHORTAGE AREAS,  THE  COMMIS-
 SIONER,  TO  THE  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE, SHALL UTILIZE CRITERIA CONSISTENT

 ICATION BY A SPECIALITY MEDICAL BOARD ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMMISSIONER.
