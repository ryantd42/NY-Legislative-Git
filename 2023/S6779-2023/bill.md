  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on  Corpo-
  rations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN ACT to amend the New York state urban development corporation act, in
  relation to enacting the HIRE NY act

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "hire individuals in the real economy New York (HIRE NY) act".
  §  2.  Section  1 of chapter 174 of the laws of 1968, constituting the
 New York state urban development corporation act, is amended by adding a
 new section 16-bb to read as follows:
  § 16-BB. THE HIRE NEW YORK PROGRAM. 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THE  LEGIS-
 LATURE HEREBY FINDS THAT MICRO-BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINES OF OUR ECONOMY
 AND  ARE  VITAL  TO  THE REVITALIZATION OF COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS
 THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER  FINDS  THAT  CURRENT  LAW
 FAILS  TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO START OR EXPAND BUSINESSES. THE LEGISLATURE
 FINDS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO SPUR START-UP MICRO-BUSINESSES  THAT  HAVE
 THE  POTENTIAL  TO  BECOME  THE  JOB ENGINES FOR TOMORROW'S ECONOMY. THE
 LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS INVESTMENTS IN ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  FAIL  TO
 PROVIDE  ANY  FUNDING TO MICRO-BUSINESSES. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS
 THAT SMALL MICRO-BUSINESSES WITH THE PROPER  INCENTIVES  ARE  POISED  TO
 PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT LOCAL JOB CREATION ACROSS THE STATE. THE LEGISLATURE
 FURTHER  FINDS THAT TAX CREDITS ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE JOB CREATION INCEN-
 TIVE FOR MICRO-BUSINESSES BECAUSE MANY  OF  THESE  BUSINESSES  LACK  THE
 INCOME THAT MAKES A TAX CREDIT MEANINGFUL. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS
 THAT  CREATION OF A STATEWIDE HIRE NEW YORK FUND WILL PROVIDE THE NEEDED
 CAPITAL FOR THE BUSINESSES OF TOMORROW TO GROW AND EMPLOY MORE NEW YORK-
 ERS.
  2. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS SECTION,  THE  FOLLOWING  TERMS  SHALL
 HAVE THE MEANINGS INDICATED:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
