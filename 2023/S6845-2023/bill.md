 PERSON  ADMITTED  WISHES TO DESIGNATE A PERSON AS A DOMESTIC PARTNER WHO
 IN THE ABSENCE AND UNAVAILABILITY OF A NEXT-OF-KIN OR  NEAREST  RELATIVE
 SHALL  HAVE ALL OF THE PRIVILEGES OF A NEXT-OF-KIN RESPECTING VISITATION
 AND AUTHORIZATION FOR SURGERY SHOULD THE  PERSON  ADMITTED  SUBSEQUENTLY
 BECOME  UNABLE  TO  GRANT  SUCH  AUTHORIZATION AND HAS GIVEN NO SPECIFIC

 ING  IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE DEEMED TO GRANT A DOMESTIC PARTNER ANY
 GREATER RIGHTS OR PRIVILEGES THAN THOSE THAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED  FOR  A

 SION SHALL PRECLUDE THE USE OF A HEALTH-CARE PROXY  OR  LIVING  WILL  OR
 BOTH FOR SUCH PURPOSE AND UNLESS REVOKED THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH PROXY OR
 LIVING WILL OR BOTH SHALL PREVAIL OVER ANY DESIGNATION MADE ON AN ADMIS-
 SIONS FORM PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rules or regulations necessary for the  imple-
 mentation of the foregoing section of this act on its effective date are
