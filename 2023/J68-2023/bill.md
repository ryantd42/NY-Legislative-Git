  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 12-18, 2023, as Children of Alcoholics Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  set aside to increase awareness of serious issues which
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions, this Legislative Body is proud to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 12-18, 2023, as  Children  of
Alcoholics  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Children of Alcoholics Week, led by the  National
Association for Children of Alcoholics; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Children of Alcoholics Week celebrates the recovery of the
many thousands of children who have received the  help  they  needed  to
recover  from  the pain and loss suffered in their childhood, and offers
hope to all those still suffering; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Association for Children of Alcoholics  states
that  preschool  children  of alcoholics have poorer language skills and
school-age children  of  alcoholics  are  at  risk  for  being  worried,
distracted and absent; all of these children may be at a greater risk of
both mental and physical health risks; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Children  of Alcoholics Week calls attention to the one in
four children under the age of 18 who are exposed to  parents  or  other
family members who suffer from alcoholism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this important issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local,  state  and  national  levels  to reduce this serious issue; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 12-18, 2023, as
Children of Alcoholics Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
