 amended to read as follows:
  3. At the close of each fiscal year any cash surplus remaining in  the
 general  fund  over  and  above  the  norm for such fiscal year shall be
 transferred from or retained in such fund as hereinafter in this  subdi-
 vision  provided.  There  shall  be transferred to the tax stabilization
 reserve fund all of such surplus moneys, up to and including  an  amount
 equivalent  to  [two-tenths]  ONE-HALF  of  one per centum of such norm,
 unless such transfer would increase such reserve fund to  an  amount  in
 excess  of  [two]  FIVE  per  centum  of the amount of the norm for such
 fiscal year, in which event such  transfer  shall  be  limited  to  such
 amount  as will increase such reserve fund to such [two] FIVE per centum
 limitation. Any balance of such surplus moneys, thereafter remaining  in
 the  general  fund,  shall be retained in such fund and be available for
 the reduction of state taxes.
  4. In the event that at the close of  any  fiscal  year  the  receipts
 derived  from  the  taxes,  fees  and other sources, required to be paid
 during such fiscal year into the general fund of the  state  shall  fall
 below the norm for such fiscal year, there shall be transferred from the
 tax  stabilization  reserve  fund to the general fund to the extent that
 there are sufficient moneys in the tax stabilization  reserve  fund,  an
 amount  equal  to the difference between the norm and the amount of such
 receipts. If such transfer reduces the tax stabilization reserve fund to
 an amount less than [two] FIVE per centum of the norm  for  such  fiscal
 year,  the  amount  so  transferred shall be repaid in cash prior to the
 computation and payment of any transfer to the fund pursuant to subdivi-
 sion three of this section in not less than three equal annual  install-
 ments within the period of six years or less next succeeding the date of
 such  transfer;  provided,  however, that if any such annual installment
 shall increase such reserve fund to an amount in excess  of  [two]  FIVE
 per  centum  of the amount of the norm for the then current fiscal year,
 such installment shall be limited to such amount as will  increase  such
 reserve  fund  to  such  [two] FIVE per centum limitation and no further
 repayment of the whole or any part of such transfer shall be required in
 any subsequent fiscal year.  Repayments to the tax stabilization reserve
 fund shall be stipulated in annual budget bills.
