  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 3, 2023, as Plastic Bag Free Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
environmental  issues  that  affect  the  lives  of citizens of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 3, 2023,  as  Plastic
Bag  Free  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of International Plastic Bag Free Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Created by Bag Free World, International Plastic  Bag  Free
Day was created as a worldwide initiative for the purpose of getting rid
of  the  single-use  of  plastic  bags  around  the  world  by promoting
environmental conservation and encouraging us all to stay away from  the
use  of  plastic  bags  and  instead,  look  for  more  eco-friendly
alternatives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Plastic pollution is a global catastrophe; plastic bags are
used by almost every retailer we visit, accounting for approximately 500
billion plastic bags which are thrown out, causing detrimental effect on
the environment, wildlife and indeed human health; plastic  bags  remain
in  the  world  for  anywhere from 100-500 years before finally decaying
completely; and
 
  WHEREAS, The marine ecosystem in particular is  suffering  immensely
as a result of plastic pollution; 31 species of marine mammals are known
to  have  ingested  marine  plastic whilst over 100 species of sea birds
have ingested plastic  artefacts,  and  over  250  species  have  become
entangled  in  plastic, whilst entanglement rates of approximately eight
percent have been discovered in some sea lion and seal species; and
 
  WHEREAS, This pollution is also extremely dangerous  because  it  is
leading  to  the  transportation  of  invasive species, which can have a
catastrophic influence on biodiversity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Humans are not  immune  from  the  impact  either;  plastic
particles  in the ocean attract toxins, which in turn affects us, as the
toxins enter the food chain; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Plastic  Bag  Free  Day  is  dedicated  to
heightening  awareness  about  these  and  very real and pressing issues
brought about by this most popular of disposable  carrying  devices;  we
are  reminded that those bags we pick up from the retailers are used for
an incredibly short  time,  usually  under  25  minutes,  and  are  then
disposed of; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Out  in  the  great reaches of the ocean are massive reefs
made up of all sorts of plastic waste, and  plastic  bags  play  heavily
 
among  them;  International Plastic Bag Free Day gives us an opportunity
to remind ourselves, and others, that every action we  take,  and  every
bag  we  dispose  of,  effects  the  lives  of everyone in the world for
generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Everyday  millions  of  plastic  bags get disposed of, and
without intervention, the future is going to be dealing with hundreds of
millions of pounds of plastic bags  clogging  oceans,  rivers,  and  the
world  at  large; the problem has reached such proportions that what was
once clean sand on the beaches of the world are now being  found  to  be
made of composites of natural substances and garbage plastic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious environmental issue, and more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity  at  the  local, state, national and international levels; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 3, 2023, as Plastic
Bag Free Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York and Bag Free World.
