  3.  "Best  value"  shall  mean  the  basis  for awarding contracts for
 services to the bidder that  optimizes  quality,  cost  and  efficiency,
 price  and  performance  criteria, which may include, but is not limited
 to:
  (a) the quality of the contractor's performance on previous projects;
  (b)  the  timeliness  of  the  contractor's  performance  on  previous
 projects;
  (c) the level of customer satisfaction with the contractor's  perform-
 ance on previous projects;
  (d)  the contractor's record of performing previous projects on budget
 and ability to minimize cost overruns;
  (e) the contractor's ability to limit change orders;
  (f) the contractor's ability to prepare appropriate project plans;
  (g) the contractor's technical capacities;
  (h) the individual qualifications of the contractor's key personnel;
  (i) the contractor's ability to assess and manage  risk  and  minimize
 risk impact;
  (j) the contractor's financial capability;
  (k)  the  contractor's ability to comply with applicable requirements,
 including the provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of  the  education
 law;
  (l) the contractor's past record of compliance with federal, state and
 local  laws, rules, licensing requirements, where applicable, and execu-
 tive orders, including but not limited to compliance with the labor  law
 and other applicable labor and prevailing wage laws, article 15-A of the
 executive  law,  and  any other applicable laws concerning minority- and
 women-owned business enterprise participation;
  (m) the contractor's record of complying with  existing  labor  stand-
 ards,  maintaining harmonious labor relations, and protecting the health
 and safety of workers and payment of  wages  above  any  locally-defined

  (n)  a  quantitative factor to be used in evaluation of bids or offers
 for awarding of contracts for bidders or offerers that are certified  as
 minority-  or  women-owned business enterprises pursuant to article 15-A
 of the executive law, and certified pursuant to local law  as  minority-
 or women-owned business enterprises. Where the authorized entity identi-
 fies  a  quantitative  factor pursuant to this paragraph, the authorized
 entity must specify that businesses certified  as  minority-  or  women-
 owned business enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law
 as  well  as those certified as minority- or women-owned business enter-
 prises pursuant to local law are eligible to qualify  for  such  factor.
 Nothing  in this paragraph shall be construed as a requirement that such
 businesses be concurrently certified as minority- or  women-owned  busi-
 ness  enterprises under article 15-A of the executive law to qualify for
 such quantitative factors. Such basis shall reflect, wherever  possible,
 objective and quantifiable analysis.
  4.  "Cost  plus"  shall mean compensating a contractor for the cost to
 complete a contract by reimbursing actual costs for labor, equipment and
 materials plus an additional amount for overhead and profit.
  5. "Design-build contract" shall mean a contract for  the  design  and
 construction  of  the authorized project with a single entity, which may
 be a team comprised of separate entities.
  6. "Project labor agreement" shall have the same meaning as such  term
 is  defined pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 222 of the labor law. A
 project labor agreement shall require participation in apprentice train-
 S. 7225  3
 
 ing programs in accordance with paragraph (e) of subdivision 2  of  such
 section.
  §  3. Notwithstanding any general, special or local law, rule or regu-
 lation to the contrary, including but not limited to article 5-A of  the
 general  municipal  law  and  section 136-a of the state finance law, in
 conformity with the requirements of this act, and only  when  a  project
 labor agreement is performed in accordance with section 222 of the labor
 law,  an  authorized  entity  may  use  the  alternative delivery method
 referred to as a design-build contract for  the  authorized  project  in
 accordance with this act.
  § 4. 1. A contractor selected by the authorized entity to enter into a
 design-build  contract  shall  be selected through a two-step method, as
 follows:
  (a) Step one. Generation of a list of responding  entities  that  have
 demonstrated  the  general  capability  to  perform  the  design-build
 contract.  Such list shall consist of a specified number  of  responding
 entities,  as determined by an authorized entity, and shall be generated
 based upon the authorized entity's review of  responses  to  a  publicly
 advertised  request  for qualifications. The authorized entity's request
 for qualifications shall include a general  description  of  the  public
 work,  the  maximum  number of responding entities to be included on the
 list, the selection criteria to be used and the relative weight of  each
 criteria  in  generating the list. Such selection criteria shall include
 the qualifications and experience of the design and  construction  team,
 organization,  demonstrated  responsibility, ability of the team or of a
 member or members of the team to comply  with  applicable  requirements,
 including  the  provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of the education
 law, past record of compliance with the labor law, and such other quali-
 fications the authorized entity deems appropriate, which may include but
 are not limited  to  project  understanding,  financial  capability  and
 record  of  past  performance.  The authorized entity shall evaluate and
 rate all responding entities to the request for qualifications.  Based
 upon such ratings, the authorized entity shall list the responding enti-
 ties that shall receive a request for proposals in accordance with para-
 graph  two of this subdivision. To the extent consistent with applicable
 federal law, the authorized entity shall  consider,  when  awarding  any
 contract pursuant to this section, the participation of:  (i) responding
 entities  that are certified as minority- or women-owned business enter-
 prises pursuant to article 15-A  of  the  executive  law,  or  certified
 pursuant  to local law as minority- or women-owned business enterprises;
 and (ii) small business concerns identified pursuant to subdivision  (b)
 of section 139-g of the state finance law.
  (b) Step two. Selection of the proposal which is the best value to the
 authorized  entity.  The  authorized  entity  shall  issue a request for
 proposals to the responding entities listed pursuant to subdivision  one
 of this section. If such a responding entity consists of a team of sepa-
 rate  entities,  the  entities  that  comprise  such  a team must remain
 unchanged from the responding entity as listed pursuant  to  subdivision
 one  of this section unless otherwise approved by the authorized entity.
 The request for proposals shall set forth the  public  work's  scope  of
 work,  and  other  requirements, as determined by the authorized entity,
 which may include separate goals for  work  under  the  contract  to  be
 performed  by  businesses certified as minority- or women-owned business
 enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law, or  certified
 pursuant  to local law as minority- or women-owned business enterprises.
 The request for proposals shall also specify the criteria to be used  to
 S. 7225  4
 
 evaluate the responses and the relative weight of each of such criteria.
 Such  criteria  shall  include  the  proposal's cost, the quality of the
 proposal's solution, the qualifications and experience of the  proposer,
 and  other  factors deemed pertinent by the authorized entity, which may
 include, but shall not be limited to, the proposal's manner and schedule
 of project implementation, the contractor's ability to complete the work
 in a timely and satisfactory manner, maintenance costs of the  completed
 public  work, maintenance of traffic approach, and community impact. Any
 contract awarded pursuant to this act shall be awarded to  a  responsive
 and  responsible  proposer,  which,  in consideration of these and other
 specified criteria deemed pertinent, offers the best  value,  as  deter-
 mined  by the authorized entity. The request for proposals shall include
 a statement that proposers shall designate in writing those portions  of
 the proposal that contain trade secrets or other proprietary information
 that  are to remain confidential; that the material designated as confi-
 dential shall be readily separable from the proposal.  Nothing  in  this
 subdivision  shall  be  construed to prohibit the authorized entity from
 negotiating final contract terms  and  conditions  including  cost.  All
 proposals  submitted shall be scored according to the criteria listed in
 the request for proposals and such final scores shall  be  published  on
 the authorized entity's website.
  2.  The  authorized  entity  awarding  a  design-build  contract  to a
 contractor offering the best value may but shall not be required to  use
 the following types of contracts:
  (a)  a  cost-plus  not  to  exceed  guaranteed  maximum  price form of
 contract in which the authorized entity shall be entitled to monitor and
 audit all costs. In establishing the schedule and process for  determin-
 ing  a  guaranteed  maximum  price,  the contract between the authorized
 entity and the contractor shall:
  (i) describe the scope of the work and the  cost  of  performing  such
 work;
  (ii) include a detailed line-item cost breakdown;
  (iii)  include a list of all drawings, specifications and other infor-
 mation on which the guaranteed maximum price is based;
  (iv) include the dates of substantial and final  completion  on  which
 the guaranteed maximum price is based; and
  (v) include a schedule of unit prices; or
  (b) a lump sum contract in which the contractor agrees to accept a set
 dollar  amount  for  a  contract  which  comprises  a single bid without
 providing a cost breakdown for all costs such as for  equipment,  labor,
 materials,  as well as such contractor's profit for completing all items
 of work comprising the public work.
  § 5. Any contract entered into pursuant to this act  shall  include  a
 clause  requiring  that  any professional services regulated by articles
 145, 147 and 148 of the education law shall be performed and stamped and
 sealed, where appropriate, by a professional licensed in accordance with
 the appropriate articles of the education law.
  § 6. Construction with respect to any  contract  entered  into  by  an
 authorized  entity  pursuant to this act shall be deemed a "public work"
 to be performed in accordance with the provisions of article  8  of  the
 labor  law, as well as subject to sections 200, 240, 241 and 242 of such
 law and enforcement of prevailing wage requirements pursuant to applica-
 ble law or, for projects or public works receiving federal aid, applica-
 ble federal requirements for prevailing wage. Any contract entered  into
 pursuant  to  this  act  shall  include  a clause requiring the selected
 contractor to obligate every tier of contractor working  on  the  public
 S. 7225  5
 
 work  to  comply  with the project labor agreement referenced in section
 four of this act, and shall include project labor  agreement  compliance
 monitoring  and  enforcement  provisions  consistent with the applicable
 project labor agreement.
  §  7.  Any  contract  entered into by an authorized entity pursuant to
 this act shall comply with the  objectives  and  goals  with  regard  to
 minority-  and  women-owned  business  enterprises  and, for projects or
 public works receiving federal aid, applicable federal requirements  for
 disadvantaged business enterprises or minority- and women-owned business
 enterprises.
  §  8. Any authorized project undertaken by an authorized entity pursu-
 ant to this act shall be subject to the requirements of article 8 of the
 environmental conservation law, and, where applicable, the  requirements
 of the national environmental policy act.
  §  9.  1.  Notwithstanding  any  provision of law to the contrary, all
 rights or benefits, including terms and conditions  of  employment,  and
 protection  of  civil  service  and  collective bargaining status of all
 employees of authorized entities solely in connection  with  the  public
 works identified in subdivision six of section two of this act, shall be
 preserved and protected.
  2.  Nothing  in  this act shall result in the: (a) displacement of any
 currently  employed  worker  or  loss  of  position,  including  partial
 displacement  such  as  a  reduction  in the hours of non-overtime work,
 wages or employment benefits, or result in the  impairment  of  existing
 collective  bargaining  agreements,  and (b) transfer of existing duties
 and functions related to maintenance and operations currently  performed
 by existing employees of authorized entities to a contractor.
  3. Employees of authorized entities using design-build contracts serv-
 ing in positions in newly created titles shall be assigned to the appro-
 priate bargaining unit. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed
 to  affect: (a) the existing rights of employees of such entities pursu-
 ant to an existing collective bargaining  agreement,  (b)  the  existing
 representational relationships among employee organizations representing
 employees  of such entities, or (c) the bargaining relationships between
 such entities and such employee organizations.
  § 10. The submission of a proposal or responses or the execution of  a
 design-build  contract pursuant to this act shall not be construed to be
 a violation of section 6512 of the education law.
  § 11. Nothing contained in this act shall limit  the  right  or  obli-
 gation  of  any  authorized  entity to comply with the provisions of any
 existing contract or to award contracts as otherwise provided by law.
  § 12. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire  and  be
 deemed  repealed  two  years  after  such  date; provided, however, that
 public works with requests  for  qualifications  issued  prior  to  such
 repeal  shall  be  permitted  to continue under this act notwithstanding
 such repeal.
