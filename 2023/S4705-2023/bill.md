 BASE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT ALLOWED FOR HIS OR HER  INCOME  LEVEL  BY  THE
 TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OR MARRIED COUPLES FILING A JOINT RETURN WHO
 ARE  PAYING THE RENT, WHETHER OR NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A CREDIT, TO DETERMINE
 THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT ALLOWED TO THAT QUALIFIED TAXPAYER. ANY  ADDITIONAL
 AMOUNT OF CREDIT DETERMINED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY
 SUCH TAXPAYER SHALL NOT BE SO DIVIDED.
  (C)  A  QUALIFIED  TAXPAYER  SHALL  BE  ALLOWED  THE CREDIT UNDER THIS
 SUBSECTION OR THE CREDIT UNDER SUBSECTION (E) OF THIS SECTION, WHICHEVER
 IS THE HIGHER AMOUNT.
