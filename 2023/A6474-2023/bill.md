 person; or
  (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree,  burglary  in  the

 A. 6474  2
 
 INJURY TO ANOTHER PERSON UNLESS IMMEDIATELY APPREHENDED. WHERE FEASIBLE,
 A  POLICE  OFFICER  OR PEACE OFFICER SHALL, PRIOR TO THE USE OF FORCE,
 MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF OR HERSELF AS A POLICE OFFI-
 CER  OR  PEACE OFFICER AND TO WARN THAT DEADLY FORCE MAY BE USED, UNLESS
 THE OFFICER HAS OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE SUCH PERSON IS
 AWARE OF THOSE FACTS; or
  (b) [The offense committed or attempted by such person  was  a  felony
 and  that,  in  the course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to
 escape from custody, such person is armed with a firearm or deadly weap-
 on; or
  (c)] Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of  the
 arrest  or  attempted escape, the use of deadly physical force is neces-
 sary to defend the police officer or peace  officer  or  another  person
 from  what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use
 of deadly physical force.
  1-A. A POLICE OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER  SHALL  NOT  USE  DEADLY  FORCE
 AGAINST  A  PERSON BASED ON THE DANGER THAT SUCH PERSON POSES TO HIMSELF
 OR HERSELF, IF AN  OBJECTIVELY  REASONABLE  OFFICER  WOULD  BELIEVE  THE
 PERSON DOES NOT POSE AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJU-
 RY TO THE POLICE OFFICER, PEACE OFFICER OR TO ANOTHER PERSON.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
