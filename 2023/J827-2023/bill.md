  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023, as Myasthenia Gravis Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2023,  as  Myasthenia  Gravis
Awareness  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with National
Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is a disorder causing extreme muscle
weakness which can impact a person's ability to see, smile,  walk,  talk
and breathe; furthermore, this disorder is often misdiagnosed; it can be
controllable  by  medication  and other treatments for most MG patients,
and although rare, it can prove fatal; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because of its rarity,  approximately  100,000  people  are
living  with  MG  in  the  United States today, often many Americans are
undiagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, Inc. (MGFA) is
a not-for-profit organization founded in 1952; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its mission, MGFA steadfastly facilitates
the timely  diagnosis  and  optimal  care  of  individuals  affected  by
Myasthenia  Gravis  and improves their lives through programs of patient
services,  support  groups,  public  information,  medical  research,
professional education, advocacy and patient care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Myasthenia
Gravis Awareness Month in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with
National Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
