  Section 1. Section 5103 of the insurance law is amended  by  adding  a

 FRAUD PERPETRATED BY THE CLAIMANT IS SUPPORTED BY THE TESTIMONY ELICITED
 FROM  SUCH CLAIMANT AT AN EXAMINATION UNDER OATH, SUCH INSURER SHALL NOT
 DENY SUCH CLAIMANT FIRST PARTY BENEFITS UNLESS  IT  HAS  SUBMITTED  SUCH
 ALLEGATION  OF  FRAUD  TO ARBITRATION AND HAS BEEN AWARDED PERMISSION TO
 DENY SUCH FIRST PARTY BENEFITS BY  THE  ARBITRATOR.  THE  SUPERINTENDENT

 GATIONS OF FRAUD MADE BY INSURERS.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.  Effective  immediately,  the  addition,  amendment
 and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation
 of  this  act  on  its  effective  date  are  authorized  to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
