 ITY'S ORDER; OR
  D. THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO AWARD
 CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO A PROCESS FOR COMPETITIVE REQUESTS  FOR  PROPOSALS

 PROPOSALS AND AWARDING A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF A FORMAL EVALUATION OF

 FINANCING OF SUCH PROPOSALS AGAINST STATED  SELECTION  CRITERIA.  PUBLIC
 NOTICE  OF  THE REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS SHALL BE GIVEN IN THE SAME MANNER
 AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION AND SHALL  INCLUDE  THE
 SELECTION  CRITERIA.  IN THE EVENT THE AUTHORITY MAKES A MATERIAL CHANGE
 IN THE SELECTION CRITERIA FROM THOSE PREVIOUSLY STATED IN THE NOTICE, IT
 WILL INFORM ALL PROPOSERS OF SUCH CHANGE AND PERMIT PROPOSERS TO  MODIFY

  (I) THE AUTHORITY MAY AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY
 AFTER A RESOLUTION APPROVED BY A VOTE OF ITS MEMBERS AT A PUBLIC MEETING
 OF THE AUTHORITY WITH SUCH RESOLUTION (A) DISCLOSING THE OTHER PROPOSERS
 AND  THE  SUBSTANCE  OF THEIR PROPOSALS, (B) SUMMARIZING THE NEGOTIATION
 PROCESS INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITIES, IF ANY, AVAILABLE TO  PROPOSERS  TO

 UPON WHICH THE SELECTION WAS MADE.

 ATIONS  WITH  ANY  PROPOSERS  FOLLOWING  THE RECEIPT OF RESPONSES TO THE
 REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR (B) THE REJECTION OF ANY OR  ALL  PROPOSALS  AT
 ANY TIME. UPON THE REJECTION OF ALL PROPOSALS, THE AUTHORITY MAY SOLICIT
 NEW PROPOSALS OR BIDS IN ANY MANNER PRESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.

 REASONS OF EFFICIENCY, ECONOMY, COMPATIBILITY OR  MAINTENANCE  RELIABIL-
 ITY,  THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR STANDARDIZATION, THE AUTHORITY MAY ESTAB-
 LISH PROCEDURES WHEREBY PARTICULAR SUPPLIES, MATERIALS OR EQUIPMENT  ARE
 IDENTIFIED  ON  A QUALIFIED PRODUCTS LIST. SUCH PROCEDURES SHALL PROVIDE
 FOR PRODUCTS OR VENDORS TO BE ADDED TO OR DELETED  FROM  SUCH  LIST  AND
 SHALL INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR PUBLIC ADVERTISEMENT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH
 SUCH  LISTS  ARE  COMPILED. THE AUTHORITY SHALL REVIEW SUCH LIST NO LESS
