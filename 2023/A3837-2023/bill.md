 HOUSE  GRADING  SYSTEM. 1. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR
 GRADING INSPECTION RESULTS FOR RETAIL FOOD STORES, FOOD  SERVICE  ESTAB-

 THIS ARTICLE. SUCH SYSTEM SHALL USE AND POST LETTERS A, B OR C TO  IDEN-
 TIFY  AND REPRESENT SUCH GRADING AND CLASSIFICATION WITH ALL OTHER LOWER
 GRADES BEING DEEMED TO BE FAILING GRADES. IN ESTABLISHING SUCH SYSTEM OF
 GRADING, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL TAKE  INTO  ACCOUNT  THE  PROVISIONS  OF
 TITLE  EIGHT  OF  ARTICLE  THIRTEEN  OF  THE  PUBLIC  HEALTH LAW AND THE
 PROVISIONS OF THE SANITARY CODE  TO  ESTABLISH  A  GRADING  SYSTEM  THAT
 REFLECTS  THE  SAFETY  AND  SANITATION OF THE PREMISES AND FOOD HANDLING
 PRACTICES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAWS.

 HOUSES SHALL CONSPICUOUSLY POST NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO SUCH  ESTABLISHMENT

 LISHMENT'S MOST RECENTLY GRADED INSPECTION BY THE DEPARTMENT. SUCH POST-
 ING SHALL BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULES AND  REGULATIONS  PROMULGATED
 BY  THE COMMISSIONER.  IN ADDITION TO A LETTER GRADE, SUCH ESTABLISHMENT
 SHALL RECEIVE THE FINDINGS UPON WHICH SUCH GRADE IS  BASED.  THE  RETAIL
 FOOD STORE, FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT OR FOOD WAREHOUSE MAY APPEAL SUCH
 SUBSEQUENT  ASSIGNMENT OF A LETTER GRADE DESIGNATION TO THE COMMISSIONER

  (B) FOR ESTABLISHMENTS WITH A GRADE OF "B", AT LEAST ONCE  EVERY  NINE
 MONTHS.
  4.  A  RETAIL FOOD STORE, FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT OR FOOD WAREHOUSE
 THAT REQUESTS A REINSPECTION FROM THE DEPARTMENT, SHALL PAY THE  DEPART-
 MENT A FEE OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE

 DEPARTMENT TO INSPECT A RETAIL FOOD STORE, FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT OR
 FOOD WAREHOUSE ON THE BASIS OF A COMPLAINT FROM A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC.
  § 2. This act shall take effect two years after it shall have become a
 law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amendment  and/or  repeal  of
