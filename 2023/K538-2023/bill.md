Native American tribes, followed by the Suydam, Wyckoff,  Ditmar,  Lott,

  WHEREAS,  Woodhaven  traces its inception to July 1, 1835, when John
R. Pitkin purchased land to found a community he named Woodville,  which
in  1853  became Woodhaven in order to avoid confusion with another town
of the same name; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the pivotal  developers  of  Woodhaven  was  Florian

Co. factory with his partner Charles Lalance, and then built  a  company
town with homes, churches, a park, and a library; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Woodhaven  is  a  charming  neighborhood in Queens
boasting many stores and restaurants that  are  individually  or  family
owned,  beautiful  homes  in  the  Victorian  and  Colonial  styles, and
residents filled with love for their community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The neighborhood is a suburban  oasis  in  New  York  City,
replete with low density housing, low-rise commercial buildings, and one
of the largest tree populations in Queens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Historic small businesses, some of which have operated for
over a century, abound in  Woodhaven,  including  Neir's  Tavern,  Pop's
Restaurant, Manor Delicatessen, and Schmidt's Candy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Woodhaven  is home to numerous historic residences, houses
of worship, and  other  landmarks,  including  St.  Matthew's  Episcopal
Church, the Emanuel United Church of Christ, the Wyckoff-Snediker Family
Cemetery,  the  Crystal  Manor Hotel building, the Queens Public Library
Woodhaven Branch, the Queens Fire Alarm Telegraph Station, the Woodhaven
Post Office, the Spear and Company Factory, and homes that  are  over  a
century old; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The crown jewel of Woodhaven is the beautiful Forest Park,
founded in 1895, and known for its  hiking  and  biking  trails,  Strack
Pond,  the  George Seuffert, Sr. Bandshell, and the historic Forest Park
Carousel; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  neighborhood  is  a  center of the arts, home to many
artists, the Woodhaven Art  Circle,  and  frequent  cultural  events  in
Forest Park; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Woodhaven  is  known  for  its  diverse  community of over
55,000, and was the home of notable people including Adrien Brody, Betty
Smith, Mae West, Barry Sullivan, and George Gershwin; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining fruitful over the ebb  and  flow  of  decades  of
growth  and  change,  the  neighborhood  of  Woodhaven  continues  its
commitment to enhancing the quality of life of its residents, ensuring a
positive business and social climate; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 188th Anniversary of Woodhaven to be celebrated on July
