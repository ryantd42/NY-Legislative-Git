camps;  the  first wave of Karen refugees fled to Thailand in January of
1984; and

Thailand  because  the Thai government is trying to shut them down; more

Karen populations include  California,  Texas,  New  York  and  Indiana;
according  to  the  Minnesota  Karen  Association,  there were more than
17,000 Karen living in Minnesota in 2017; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Karen peoples' two  most  important  holidays  are  The
Karen New Year which usually falls in December-January because the Karen
people  follow  the  lunar  calendar, and The Karen Wrist Tying which is
observed annually in August throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  They  come together and celebrate Karen New Year and Karen
Wrist Tying throughout the State of New York; for the  past  few  years,

Organization of the United States of America (KOUSA) and Karen  American
Organization  (KAO) leaders explored the possibility of working together
and merging the  two  organizations  in  order  to  improve  operational
effectiveness,  increase  cooperation,  strengthen  and  acclimate Karen
communities in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  leaders  of  the  two  groups  agreed  to  merge  and
collaborate  as  one entity and became the Karen Organization of America
in August of 2018, in Omaha, Nebraska; and

recognize  August  2023,  as  Karen  American  Heritage Month; and be it
