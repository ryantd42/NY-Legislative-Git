  outdoor  recreation  industry;  and  providing  for the repeal of such
  provisions upon the expiration thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. a. The legislature hereby declares that fair competition in
 the  outdoor  recreation  industry  is  important and desirable and that
 issues surrounding the public ownership of outdoor recreational  facili-
 ties, including but not limited to, golf, ski and camping facilities and
 the  impact  of  such facilities on privately owned outdoor recreational
 facilities should be examined. As such, it is  determined  that  a  blue
 ribbon commission on competitive issues relating to the public ownership
 of  outdoor  recreational  facilities  shall  be  established to examine
 whether such facilities enjoy unfair  competitive  advantages  and  make
 recommendations regarding methods to address any such unfair competitive
 advantages. Such commission shall submit a report and recommendations to
 the governor and the legislature upon completion of such examination.
  b.  A blue ribbon commission on fair competition in the outdoor recre-
 ation industry is hereby  established  to  examine,  evaluate  and  make
 recommendations  regarding  methods  to  promote fair competition in the
 outdoor recreation industry. For purposes of this  act  "outdoor  recre-
 ation  industry" shall include, but not be limited to, golf, camping and
 ski facilities. The subject areas to be examined by the commission shall
 include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (1) a comparison of the following between public and  privately  owned
 outdoor recreational facilities:

 public  and  privately owned recreational facilities on fair competition
 in the outdoor recreation industry;
  (3) an evaluation and comparison of prices and fees charged by  public
 and  privately  owned  outdoor  recreational  facilities and whether any
 reduced prices  and  fees  charged  by  publicly  owned  facilities  are
 intended  to  gain  a competitive advantage over other facilities and an
 evaluation of the impact of any differences in prices and fees  on  fair
 competition in the outdoor recreation industry;

 ation industry in New York state with public and privately owned facili-
