 Introduced  by Sens. HOYLMAN-SIGAL, KRUEGER, RAMOS, SALAZAR, STAVISKY --
  read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to  be  committed  to
  the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, the criminal procedure
  law  and  the  executive law, in relation to prohibiting possession of
  reproductive or sexual health devices from being permitted  in  speci-
  fied criminal or civil proceedings as evidence of prostitution
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "end crimi-
 nalization of condoms act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that promoting
 and protecting health and respecting and  fulfilling  human  rights  are
 necessarily  linked,  and  that  health-oriented  and  rights-based  law
 enforcement efforts are central to the effective provision of government
 services for the benefit of the people of the state. Section 3 of  arti-
 cle  17 of the New York state constitution requires that the legislature
 protect and promote the health of the inhabitants of  this  state  as  a
 matter  of  public  concern.  Despite  these provisions, for purposes of
 prosecuting certain criminal, civil and administrative offenses,  repro-
 ductive  and sexual health tools, including condoms, are currently being
 destroyed, confiscated, or used as evidence by law enforcement officers.
 This legislation is intended to strengthen the public health of all  New
 Yorkers,  including the most vulnerable, while preserving the ability of
 law  enforcement  to  prosecute  other  crimes  such  as  felony  sexual
 offenses.  The  purpose  of this act is to avoid the disparate impact of
 the practice of citing condoms and other reproductive and sexual  health
 tools  as  evidence  upon survivors of trafficking and people who are or
 are profiled as being engaged in the sex trades.
  § 3. The civil practice law and rules  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 4519-b to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
