  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the state liquor authority is authorized to grant a  license  credit  to
 any on-premises licensee and any manufacturing licensee with on-premises
 retail  privileges  that are licensed pursuant to the alcoholic beverage
 control law to receive a credit to the next renewal of their license  on
 a pro-rata basis for each inactive day, up to a maximum of three hundred
 sixty-five  days.  An  inactive day shall mean each day between March 7,
 2020 and March 7, 2021 that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic or the govern-
 ment response to the pandemic, the licensee was closed,  or  ceased  all
 on-premises  retail  business functions that require a license under the
 alcoholic beverage control law. The on-premises licensee and  any  manu-
 facturing  licensee with on-premises retail privileges shall document to
 the state liquor authority, on a form provided  by  the  authority,  the
 number  of  inactive  days,  up to a maximum of three hundred sixty-five
 days, that they are claiming for a credit to  be  added  to  their  next
 retail on-premise license renewal.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed January 1, 2026.
