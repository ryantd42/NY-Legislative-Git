**Bill ID:** A2299AA
**Session:** 2023
**Sponsor:** Donna Lupardo
**Status:** In Assembly Committee

## Summary

Establishes the agrivoltaics viability pilot program within the farmland viability program to provide grants to identify the best practices and strategies for dual-use solar energy projects that protect soil health during construction and decommissioning of solar arrays, utilize sustainable agricultural production practices, monitor any benefits solar energy may have on farms and to the state, track economic viability, study the commercialization of dual-use solar energy projects, and encourage equitable engagement of stakeholders.

 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation  to  estab-
  lishing the agrivoltaics viability pilot program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of section 327 of the agriculture and
 markets law is designated subdivision 1 and a new subdivision 2 is added
 to read as follows:
  2. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER  FINDS  THAT  AS  NEW  YORK  PROGRESSES  TO
 UTILIZING  CLEAN  ENERGY THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
 PLAY  A  SUBSTANTIAL  ROLE  IN  ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSERVATION  WHILE  ALSO
 PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING VIABLE FARMLAND THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF AGRI-
 VOLTAICS.  DUAL-USE  SOLAR  ENERGY PROJECTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO KEEP
 FARMLAND AS WORKING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES PROVIDING ECONOMIC  BENEFITS
 TO  FARMERS AND ASSISTING THE STATE IN REACHING ITS CLIMATE AND ENVIRON-
 MENTAL IMPACT GOALS. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY DECLARES  THAT  TO  PROGRESS
 THE  INITIATIVES OF THE FARMLAND VIABILITY PROGRAM, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL
 CREATE AN AGRIVOLTAICS VIABILITY PILOT PROGRAM AS PART OF  THE  FARMLAND
 VIABILITY PROGRAM.
  §  2.  Section  328  of  the agriculture and markets law is amended by
 adding two new subdivisions 5 and 6 to read as follows:
  5. "AGRIVOLTAICS" SHALL MEAN THE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF AREAS OF LAND FOR
 BOTH SOLAR POWER GENERATION AND AGRICULTURE. FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  AGRIVOLTAICS  SHALL BE NARROWED TO THE PRACTICES OF A DUAL-USE
 SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT.
  6. "DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT" MEANS  A  SOLAR  INSTALLATION  THAT
 INTEGRATES  SOLAR  ARRAYS AND FARMING ACTIVITY ON THE SAME GROUND. TO BE
 CONSIDERED DUAL-USE, A SOLAR INSTALLATION CANNOT DISPLACE FARMING ACTIV-
 ITY; FARMING ACTIVITY MUST BE MAINTAINED  THROUGHOUT  THE  LIFE  OF  THE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 SOLAR  FACILITY  IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH COMMERCIAL AGRICUL-
 TURAL PRODUCTION AS APPROPRIATE TO THE CAPACITY OF THE LAND WHEN  FARMED
 SUSTAINABLY.  THE  TERM  "DUAL-USE" REFERS TO A SOLAR INSTALLATION THAT:
 (I) RETAINS OR ENHANCES THE LAND'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, BOTH SHORT
 TERM  AND  LONG  TERM; (II) IS BUILT, MAINTAINED, AND HAS PROVISIONS FOR
 DECOMMISSIONING TO PROTECT THE LAND'S AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES AND  UTILI-
 TY; AND (III) SUPPORTS THE VIABILITY OF A FARMING OPERATION.
  §  3.  Section  329  of  the agriculture and markets law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL INITIATE AND MAINTAIN A  STATE  AGRIVOLTAICS
 VIABILITY  PILOT  PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE FARM VIABILITY
 PROGRAM TO PROGRESS THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE FARM  PROFITABIL-
 ITY  AND  SOUND  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. THE
 AGRIVOLTAICS VIABILITY PILOT PROGRAM SHALL PROVIDE  GRANTS  TO  IDENTIFY
 THE  BEST  PRACTICES  AND  STRATEGIES FOR DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS
 THAT PROTECT SOIL HEALTH  DURING  CONSTRUCTION  AND  DECOMMISSIONING  OF
 SOLAR  ARRAYS,  UTILIZE  SUSTAINABLE  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES,
 MONITOR ANY BENEFITS SOLAR ENERGY MAY HAVE ON FARMS AND  TO  THE  STATE,
 TRACK  ECONOMIC VIABILITY, STUDY THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF DUAL-USE SOLAR
 ENERGY PROJECTS, AND ENCOURAGE EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS.
  A. THE COMMISSIONER, IN CONSULTATION  WITH  THE  OFFICE  OF  RENEWABLE
 ENERGY  SITING  AND  THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, SHALL
 ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY FOR THE  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  THE
 PILOT  PROGRAM, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) THE PROCESS BY WHICH A
 LANDOWNER MAY APPLY FOR THE APPROVAL NEEDED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE  PILOT
 PROGRAM; AND (II) PROVISIONS PRESCRIBING STANDARDS CONCERNING IMPERVIOUS
 COVER  WHICH  MAY  BE PERMITTED IN CONNECTION WITH DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY
 PROJECTS AUTHORIZED TO BE CONSTRUCTED, INSTALLED, AND OPERATED ON  FARM-
 LAND PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  B.  THE  OFFICE  OF  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  SITING SHALL PROVIDE TECHNICAL
 ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER CONCERNING  THE  PROMULGATION
 OF  THE  PILOT PROGRAM AND ANY GRANTEES ON IMPLEMENTING A DUAL-USE SOLAR
 ENERGY PROJECT.
  C. ONE YEAR AFTER GRANTS ARE DISTRIBUTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT

 DISTRIBUTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AS A PILOT PROGRAM UNDER  THE  FARM
 VIABILITY  PROGRAM.  THE  AGRIVOLTAICS  VIABILITY PILOT PROGRAM SHALL BE
 DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE PURPOSE OF THE FARM VIABILITY PROGRAM.
  § 5. This act shall take effect six months after it shall have  become
 a  law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of
 any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation of this  act  on
