**Bill ID:** A2299A
**Session:** 2023
**Sponsor:** Donna Lupardo
**Status:** In Assembly Committee

## Summary

Establishes the agrivoltaics viability pilot program within the farmland viability program to provide grants to identify the best practices and strategies for dual-use solar energy projects that protect soil health during construction and decommissioning of solar arrays, utilize sustainable agricultural production practices, monitor any benefits solar energy may have on farms and to the state, track economic viability, study the commercialization of dual-use solar energy projects, and encourage equitable engagement of stakeholders.

 Introduced  by M. of A. LUPARDO -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets  law,  in  relation  to  the
  construction,  installation  and  operation  of  dual-use solar energy
  projects on certain land which receives an agricultural assessment

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  agriculture and markets law is amended by adding two
 new sections 305-d and 305-e to read as follows:
  § 305-D. DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS PILOT PROGRAM.  1. THE DEPART-
 MENT SHALL ESTABLISH A  DUAL-USE  SOLAR  ENERGY  PROJECT  PILOT  PROGRAM
 PROMOTING  THE INSTALLATION OF DUAL-USE ENERGY PROJECTS ON CERTAIN AGRI-
 CULTURAL LAND. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL OVERSEE THE  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  THE
 PILOT PROGRAM.
  2. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION:
  A.  "DUAL-USE  SOLAR  ENERGY  PROJECT" MEANS A SOLAR INSTALLATION THAT
 INTEGRATES SOLAR ARRAYS AND FARMING ACTIVITY ON THE SAME GROUND.  TO  BE
 CONSIDERED DUAL-USE, A SOLAR INSTALLATION CANNOT DISPLACE FARMING ACTIV-
 ITY;  FARMING  ACTIVITY  MUST  BE  MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE
 SOLAR FACILITY IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH  COMMERCIAL  AGRICUL-
 TURAL  PRODUCTION AS APPROPRIATE TO THE CAPACITY OF THE LAND WHEN FARMED
 SUSTAINABLY. DUAL-USE IS DIFFERENT THAN SIMPLE CO-LOCATION WHICH  GENER-
 ALLY  INVOLVES  TRADITIONAL GROUND-MOUNTED SOLAR INSTALLATIONS THAT HOST
 NON-AGRICULTURAL PLANTINGS WITH ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.  THE
 TERM  "DUAL-USE"  REFERS  TO  A  SOLAR INSTALLATION THAT: (I) RETAINS OR
 ENHANCES THE LAND'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, BOTH SHORT TERM AND  LONG
 TERM;  (II) IS BUILT, MAINTAINED, AND HAS PROVISIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING
 TO PROTECT THE LAND'S AGRICULTURAL  RESOURCES  AND  UTILITY;  AND  (III)
 SUPPORTS THE VIABILITY OF A FARMING OPERATION.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 2299  2
 
  B. "PRESERVED FARMLAND" MEANS LAND ON WHICH A DEVELOPMENT EASEMENT WAS
 CONVEYED TO, OR RETAINED BY, THE COMMITTEE, A BOARD, OR A QUALIFYING TAX
 EXEMPT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOR FARMLAND PRESERVATION PURPOSES.
  C. "UNPRESERVED FARMLAND" MEANS ANY LAND THAT IS VALUED, ASSESSED, AND
 TAXED AS FARMLAND AND IS NOT PRESERVED FARMLAND.
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION TO
 THE CONTRARY, ANY OWNER OF UNPRESERVED FARMLAND WHICH RECEIVES AN  AGRI-
 CULTURAL  ASSESSMENT,  MAY  CONSTRUCT,  INSTALL,  AND OPERATE A DUAL-USE
 SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT ON SUCH FARMLAND, PROVIDED THAT:
  A. THE OWNER OF THE UNPRESERVED FARMLAND WHICH  RECEIVES  AN  AGRICUL-
 TURAL  ASSESSMENT OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT, IN ADDITION TO
 ANY OTHER APPROVALS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO STATE OR LOCAL LAW,
 RULE, REGULATION, OR ORDINANCE, PRIOR TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF  THE  DUAL-
 USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT;
  B.  THE CAPACITY OF THE DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT IS LESS THAN TEN
 MEGAWATTS OF POWER;
  C. THE DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT IS NOT LOCATED:
  (I) WITHIN THE ADIRONDACK PARK, THE CATSKILL PARK OR ANY OTHER  FOREST
 PRESERVE, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 9-0101 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
 LAW; OR
  (II)  IN  FRESHWATER  WETLANDS,  AS  DEFINED IN SECTION 24-0107 OF THE
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW, OR TIDAL WETLANDS AS DEFINED IN  SECTION
 25-0103 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW; OR
  D.  THE  OWNER  OF THE UNPRESERVED FARMLAND WHICH RECEIVES AN AGRICUL-
 TURAL ASSESSMENT HAS FILED A CONSERVATION PLAN WITH THE  SOIL  CONSERVA-
 TION  DISTRICT  TO  ACCOUNT  FOR THE AESTHETIC, IMPERVIOUS COVERAGE, AND
 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY  PROJECT,  INCLUDING,
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WATER RECAPTURE AND FILTRATION, AND THE CONSERVATION
 PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE DISTRICT;
  E. THE PROJECT COMPLIES WITH THE AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
 PROGRAM  AND  ANY AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN ESTABLISHED
 PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ELEVEN-A OF THIS CHAPTER; AND
  F. THE OWNER OF THE UNPRESERVED FARMLAND WHICH  RECEIVES  AN  AGRICUL-
 TURAL  ASSESSMENT,  OR  THE PERSON UNDERTAKING THE DUAL-USE SOLAR ENERGY
 PROJECT,  AS  APPLICABLE,  OBTAINS  ALL  NECESSARY  PERMITS  AND  OTHER
 APPROVALS  AS  MAY BE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAW,
 RULE, REGULATION, OR ORDINANCE.
  4. THE OWNER OF THE UNPRESERVED FARMLAND WHICH  RECEIVES  AN  AGRICUL-
 TURAL ASSESSMENT SHALL SUBMIT AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL BY THE DEPART-
 MENT  BEFORE  CONSTRUCTING,  INSTALLING,  AND OPERATING A DUAL-USE SOLAR
 ENERGY FACILITY AS ALLOWED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS  SECTION.
 THE  DEPARTMENT,  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  THE OFFICE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
 SITING, SHALL, WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER RECEIPT, APPROVE, DISAPPROVE, OR
