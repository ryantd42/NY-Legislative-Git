 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to enacting the  Unemployment
  Insurance Liability Act

 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as

 that employers that have  relocated  out  of  New  York  state  are  not
 required  to  make scheduled quarterly contributions to the unemployment
 insurance fund once they have left the state.
  The legislature further declares that this creates a continuing  hard-
 ship on the fund which threatens its solvency.
  Therefore, the legislature declares that employer contributions to the
 unemployment  insurance  fund shall continue even after the employer has
 left New York state, where former employees are receiving benefits.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 562 of the  labor  law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 103 of the laws of 1965, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Required coverage. (a)  Any employer who has once become liable
 for contributions under this article with respect to persons other  than
 persons  employed in personal or domestic service in private homes shall
 [cease to be liable as of] REMAIN LIABLE UNTIL  the  first  day  of  the
 calendar  quarter next following the filing of his OR HER written appli-
 cation provided the commissioner finds that the employer has  not  RELO-
 CATED  OUT  OF STATE OR, with respect to [such] persons OTHER THAN THOSE
 EMPLOYED IN PERSONAL OR DOMESTIC SERVICE IN PRIVATE HOMES, paid remuner-
 ation of three hundred dollars or more in any of the four calendar quar-
 ters preceding such day.
  (b) AN EMPLOYER WHO HAS RELOCATED OUT OF STATE  SHALL  REMAIN  LIABLE
 FOR  CONTRIBUTIONS  TO  THE FUND FOR TWO QUARTERS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH

 CATION, AND

 service  in  a private home shall cease to be liable as of the first day
