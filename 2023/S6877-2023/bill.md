  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend the Administra-
 tive  Code of the City of New York (ACCNY) to add a new Section 13-638.7
 allowing certain employees who have concurrent eligible  employment  for
 participation  in  two  New  York  City  funded retirement systems (City
 System) a one-time chance to suspend their current membership  in  their
 first  City  System and elect to participate in the other City System as
 of the earlier of the date of election, or the date on which the  member
 would  have  been  mandated  into the subsequent system absent the prior
 membership.
  Currently, members of the New York City  Employees  Retirement  System
 (NYCERS),  the  New  York City Teachers Retirement System (TRS), and the
 New York City Board of Education Retirement System (BERS) may  not  join
 another  system  if they already have an active membership in one of the
 other systems without terminating the employment for which  the  initial
 membership was created.
  Under the proposed legislation, a City retirement system member who is
 eligible  to  join a second City retirement system based on dual employ-
 ment would be eligible to elect membership in the  other  eligible  City
 retirement system without the cessation of employment, and would forfeit
 applicable rights, benefits, and privileges of the initial prior member-
 ship  resulting in a return of applicable contributions with interest. A
 member may only accrue service credit in one system for  any  period  of
 concurrent employment.
  This  change  in  legislation would not modify the current transfer or
 reinstatement provisions available to members and therefore the  changes
 would be primarily administrative.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT: There is no data available to estimate the number of
 members who might be eligible to participate in more than one retirement
 system, and potentially benefit from this proposed legislation.
  With  respect  to  an  individual member, the financial impact of this
 proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's length
 of service, age, and salary history.
  Based on the relatively small population anticipated to be impacted by
 this proposed legislation and that these changes are more administrative
 in nature,  the  cost  associated  with  this  proposed  legislation  is
 expected to be de minimis.
 S. 6877  3
 
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY:  The  costs for this proposed legislation will
 depend on the number and demographics of the impacted population.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
