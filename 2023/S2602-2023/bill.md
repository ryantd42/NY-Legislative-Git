  Section  1.  Section  1207  of  the  civil  practice law and rules, as
 amended by chapter 355 of the laws  of  1986,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  §  1207.  Settlement of action or claim by infant, judicially declared
 incompetent or conservatee, by whom  motion  made;  special  proceeding;
 notice;  order of settlement. (A) Upon motion of a guardian of the prop-
 erty or guardian ad litem of an infant or, if there is no such guardian,
 then of a parent having legal custody of an infant, or if  there  is  no
 such parent, by another person having legal custody, or if the infant is
 married,  by an adult spouse residing with the infant, or of the commit-
 tee of the property of a person judicially declared to  be  incompetent,
 or  of  the  conservator of the property of a conservatee, the court may
 order settlement of any action commenced by or on behalf of the  infant,
 incompetent  or  conservatee. If no action has been commenced, a special
 proceeding may be commenced upon petition of such a  representative  for
 settlement of any claim by the infant, incompetent or conservatee in any
 court  where  an  action for the amount of the proposed settlement could
 have been commenced.  Unless otherwise provided by  rule  of  the  chief
 administrator  of  the courts, if no motion term is being held and there
 is no justice of the supreme court  available  in  a  county  where  the
 action  or an action on the claim is triable, such a motion may be made,
 or special proceeding may be commenced, in a county court and the county
 judge shall act with the same power as a justice of  the  supreme  court
 even  though  the amount of the settlement may exceed the jurisdictional
