 Introduced  by  Sen. PALUMBO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to develop-
  ing a database for missing domestic animals
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 16 of the agriculture and markets law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 53 to read as follows:
  53.  (A)  DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A SEARCHABLE DATABASE OF LOST AND FOUND
 DOMESTIC ANIMALS.  AN EMAIL OR TELEPHONE NUMBER SHALL BE PROVIDED ON THE
 WEBSITE TO ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS LOST OR FOUND A  DOMESTIC  ANIMAL
 TO  CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT. THE INFORMATION TO BE ENTERED INTO THE DATA-
 BASE SHALL BE THE TYPE OF ANIMAL; THE ANIMAL'S NAME;  AN  IDENTIFICATION
 NUMBER,  IF  AVAILABLE;  A PHOTO OF THE ANIMAL; AND THE COUNTY WHERE THE
 ANIMAL WAS LOST OR FOUND. THE INDIVIDUAL'S CONTACT INFORMATION SHALL  BE
 KEPT  WITHIN  THE  DEPARTMENT AND NOT MADE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE. THE
 DATABASE SHALL BE SEARCHABLE BY COUNTY AND TYPE OF ANIMAL AND SHALL HAVE
 A SECTION TO ALLOW FOR OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION THAT MAY ASSIST  WITH
 FINDING  THE  ANIMAL.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  UPDATE THE WEBSITE UPON
 RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC. ANY INFORMATION ENTERED INTO  THE
 DATABASE SHALL BE MAINTAINED FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS.
  (B) THE WEBSITE SHALL ALSO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO ASSIST
 OWNERS SEARCHING FOR LOST OR MISSING ANIMALS:
 
  "THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU LOSE A PET:
 
  1. ACT FAST.
  2.  CALL  FOR  THEM WHILE CHECKING AREAS IN THE HOME WHERE THEY MAY BE
 TRAPPED.
  3. SCENT IS KEY; THE PET'S FAVORITE FOOD AND DIRTY LAUNDRY LEFT AT THE
 DOORWAY CAN BE HELPFUL.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  4. SEARCH THE NEIGHBORHOOD SEVERAL TIMES; ASK NEIGHBORS, LETTER CARRI-
 ERS AND ANY DELIVERY PEOPLE YOU MAY SEE.
  5. LOST PET SIGNS; PUT THEM EVERYWHERE.
  6.  USE  SOCIAL  MEDIA  IN  ADDITION TO THE NEW YORK STATE MISSING PET
 DATABASE.
  7. CONTACT LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTERS AND ANIMAL CONTROL AGENCIES.
  8. BE WARY OF PET RECOVERY SCAMS. A FEW WAYS  TO  RECOGNIZE  THE  LOST
 PETS  SCAM  ARE;  IF  THEY DEMAND YOU WIRE MONEY, THEY REFUSE TO MEET IN
 PERSON, OR THEY WILL MEET BUT FIND AN EXCUSE WHY  YOU  SHOULD  PAY  THEM
 BEFORE  ACTUALLY  SEEING THE ANIMAL.  TO AVOID BEING SCAMMED, NEVER WIRE
 MONEY, DO NOT ASK LEADING QUESTIONS, MAKE THEM PROVIDE THE  DESCRIPTION,
 AND  IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THE PERSON HAS YOUR PET, ARRANGE TO
 MEET IN A PUBLIC PLACE.  IF YOU FIND A MISSING PET AND SOMEONE  CONTACTS
 YOU  CLAIMING  TO  BE  THE PET'S OWNER, YOU MUST VERIFY THEIR CLAIM. VET
 RECORDS, BREEDING PAPERS, EVEN FAMILY PHOTOS  ARE  ALL  VIABLE  WAYS  TO
 PROVE  OWNERSHIP.  THESE TIPS ARE BY NO MEANS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. THERE
 ARE MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ASSIST YOU FROM BEING SCAMMED.
  9. DON'T GIVE UP.
  ANIMALS HAVE BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR OWNERS AFTER HAVING BEEN MISSING
 FOR MONTHS.  MAKE SURE YOUR PET ALWAYS WEARS A COLLAR AND AN ID TAG,  OR
 HAS A MICROCHIP."
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
