  COMMENDING  Honorary Chief Cesar Quinones upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50 years of dedicated service to the New Hyde
  Park Fire Department on February 25, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to  commend  Honorary
Chief  Cesar  Quinones  upon the occasion of his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to  the  New  Hyde  Park
Fire  Department,  to  be  celebrated at its Annual Inspection Dinner on
Saturday, February 25, 2023, at Russo's On The Bay,  Howard  Beach,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cesar Quinones joined the New Hyde Park Fire Department on
May 1, 1973; throughout  his  50  years  of  service,  he  held  several
positions  within  the Department including: Captain, 1st Lieutenant and
2nd Lieutenant of Enterprise Engine Co. No. 1; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity;  they  are  often  the  first  to  respond  to  an
emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is a fire, transportation accident,
natural  disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical  crisis,  or  spill  of
hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Honorary Chief Cesar Quinones is such a firefighter; throughout 50 years
of devoted service, he heroically performed, above and beyond  the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Honorary  Chief  Cesar  Quinones  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation for special recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service
to  the  New  Hyde  Park Fire Department on February 25, 2023; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Honorary Chief Cesar Quinones.
