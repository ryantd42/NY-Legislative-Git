 that,  if  such incarcerated individual is released, he or she will live
 and remain at liberty without violating the law, and  that  his  or  her
 release  is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so

 for  law.  In making the parole release decision, the procedures adopted
 pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this
 article shall require that the following be considered: (i) the institu-

 A  FAMILY  MEMBER  OF  A CRIME VICTIM OR AN INTERESTED PARTY made to the
 board shall be maintained by the department in the file provided to  the
 board  when interviewing the incarcerated individual in consideration of

 CRIME  VICTIM OR INTERESTED PARTY who has submitted a written request to
 the department for the transcript of such interview  shall  be  provided
