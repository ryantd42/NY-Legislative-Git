  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 12, 2023, as Women of Color in Tech Day in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of the importance
of  improving  gender  and racial/ethnic diversity in the New York State
technology sector; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 12, 2023,  as  Women
of Color in Tech Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in  2000 and headquartered in Brooklyn, New York,
NPower  has  a  proven  tech-workforce  training  model  which  serves
approximately 1,300 young adults, ages 18-25 each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The goal of this vital initiative is to improve gender and
racial/ethnic diversity in the tech pipeline, especially  for  women  of
color  by  launching  Women  of  Color  in  Tech Day, and a coalition to
increase the representation and retention of young women of color in New
York State's technology sector; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women of Color in Tech Day is an annual day of  information
distribution,  recruitment,  training  and  job  placement; the nearly 6
million jobs expected to require tech skills in  the  future,  currently
project only 3.2 million in the candidate pool; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  technology sector in New York is growing fast and the
jobs pay considerably higher wages than  what  can  be  found  in  other
industries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Encouraging  Women  of  Color  in Tech will build respect,
dignity, fairness, equity  and  self-esteem  for  women;  it  will  also
provide  critical economic advantages to women of color who may not have
had access to traditional paths into technology jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our society is greatly benefited by the purposeful  efforts
of  coalitions that unite for the cause of improving the quality of life
for others, and that proactively work toward the goal  of  equality  for
all; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 12, 2023,  as  Women
of Color in Tech Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
