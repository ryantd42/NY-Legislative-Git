  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Trauma-Informed Care Month in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Traumatic experiences affect millions of individuals in New
York State and can affect the mental,  emotional,  physical,  spiritual,
economic, and social well-being of an individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Adverse childhood experiences, referred to as ''ACEs," can
be traumatizing and, if not recognized, can  affect  health  across  the
lifespan  of  an  individual  and,  in some cases, result in a shortened
lifespan; and
 
  WHEREAS, ACEs are recognized as a proxy for toxic stress, which  can
affect  brain  development and can cause a lifetime of physical, mental,
and social challenges; and
 
  WHEREAS, ACEs and trauma are determinants of public health  problems
in New York State such as obesity, addiction, and mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trauma-informed care is an approach that can bring greater
understanding and more effective ways to  support  and  serve  children,
adults, families, and communities affected by trauma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trauma-informed  care is not a therapy or an intervention,
but a  principle-based,  culture-change  process  aimed  at  recognizing
strengths and resiliency, as well as helping people who have experienced
trauma  to  overcome  those issues in order to lead healthy and positive
lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Adopting  trauma-informed  approaches  in  workplaces,
communities,  and  government  programs  can  aid  in preventing mental,
emotional, physical, and social issues  for  people  impacted  by  toxic
stress and trauma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trauma-informed  care has been promoted and established in
communities across New York State,  including  many  different  uses  of
trauma-informed care being utilized by various types of entities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Department of Family Assistance and the Department of
Mental  Hygiene  provides  substantial  resources  to  better  engage
individuals  and  communities  across  New  York  State  to  implement
trauma-informed care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Numerous state  agencies  have  integrated  trauma-informed
approaches  into programs and grants that those agencies administer, and
those agencies could benefit from closer collaboration; and
 
  WHEREAS, State recognition through a trauma-focused awareness  month
will  help  to  deepen  the  understanding  of  the nature and impact of
trauma, the importance of prevention, the impact that ACEs can  have  on
brain  development,  and  the  benefits  of  trauma-informed  care; now,
therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as
Trauma-Informed Care Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
