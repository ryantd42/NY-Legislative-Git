  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim September 29, 2023, as
Heart Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance
of World Heart Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Heart Day takes place on September 29th every year;
it is a chance for people across the globe to take part in  the  world's
biggest intervention against cardiovascular disease (CVD); and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are many ways for individuals to get involved, from
planning their own World Heart Day event to sharing their Healthy  Heart
Selfies on their Twitter and Facebook pages; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this devastating medical condition and more must  be  done  to  increase
activity  at  the  local, state and national levels to promote screening
and support patients and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim September 29, 2023, as
Heart Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
