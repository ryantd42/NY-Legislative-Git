BY: Senator MYRIE
 
  RECOGNIZING  the  25th  Anniversary  of  Black and
  Afro-Costa Rican Culture Day on August 31, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  of  true purpose and worthy accomplishment who foster a spirit of
community and service and, simultaneously, work diligently  to  preserve
their rich cultural heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize the 25th Anniversary of Black and Afro-Costa Rican Culture Day
on August 31, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  and Afro-Costa Rican Culture Day was established to
promote the contributions of the African diaspora in Costa Rica, and  to
eliminate all forms of discrimination against people of African descent;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  population  of Costa Rica is mostly white and mestizo
(people of mixed European and Indigenous American  ancestry);  according
to  the 2011 census, only 6.7% of Costa Ricans were of mixed African and
European ancestry and 1.1% were Afro-Caribbean or Black; and
 
  WHEREAS, Most Afro-Costa Ricans descend from Afro-Caribbean  migrant
workers  who  came  to  Costa  Rica  in  the  late  19th  and early 20th
Centuries; however, some of  them  are  descendants  of  African  slaves
brought  to  Costa Rica during the Spanish colonization of the Americas;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1980s, it was decreed in Costa Rica on August 31  as
the  celebration  of "Black Day", an initiative that was promoted by the
Costa Rican Teachers Union  (SEC),  in  the  administration  of  Rodrigo
Carazo; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Later,  another  decree  was  signed  that  extended  the
celebration of the "Black and Afro-Costa Rican Culture Day";  April  26,
2018,  the  date on which it is published in La Gaceta Digital, Law 9526
declares August the Historical Month of Afro-descendence in Costa  Rica;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Day  of the Black Person and Afro-Costa Rican Culture
was established by the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica  in  September
of 2021, and was celebrated for the first time on September 4, 2022; the
official  date  of  the holiday is August 31, but celebratory events are
held on the following Sunday; and
 
  WHEREAS, Free for the  working  population,  the  declaration  as  a
non-compulsory holiday is a necessary recognition and responds to a wide
clamor  of  the  Limonense  population with the purpose of consolidating
this celebration; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, this would allow broad  participation  of  all
the inhabitants of the country in the activities carried out around this
date; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those important days of recognition which remind  us  of  the  rich  and
diverse heritage of our great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  duly  fitting  that  all New Yorkers join in these
important celebrations of one of our State's most  vibrant  communities;
this  much  anticipated  observance and its accompanying activities will
foster greater appreciation for Afro-Costa Rican culture  and  serve  to
promote the spirit of cooperation that is characteristic of all citizens
of New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize the 25th Anniversary of Black and Afro-Costa Rican Culture Day
on August 31, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Consulate General of Costa Rica in New York.
