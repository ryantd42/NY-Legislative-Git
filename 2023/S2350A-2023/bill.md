  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the  contrary,  for
 the  purposes of the site preparation credit component of the brownfield
 redevelopment tax credit pursuant to section 21 of the tax law, as added
 by chapter 1 of the laws of 2003, a taxpayer can claim a  site  prepara-
 tion  credit with respect to a site's qualification for a certificate of
 completion in the taxable year following  the  taxable  year  where  the
 certificate  of  completion  was  issued by the commissioner of environ-
 mental conservation pursuant to section  27-1419  of  the  environmental
 conservation  law,  where  the  taxpayer  did not own the qualified site
 during the taxable year in  which  the  certificate  of  completion  was
 issued,  but  became  the  owner of the qualified site and paid the site
 preparation costs relevant to the credit claim in the taxable year after
 the certificate of completion was issued.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  apply  to  site
 preparation  credit  components  of  brownfield redevelopment tax credit
