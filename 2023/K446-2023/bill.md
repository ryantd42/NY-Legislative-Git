  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 9, 2023, as Fentanyl Awareness Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
official days set aside to increase awareness of serious  health  issues
which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 9, 2023, as Fentanyl
Awareness Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Fentanyl Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  would like to take this moment to
remember all those who lost the battle to fentanyl, such as  19-year-old
Paige  Gibbons  of  Pittsford,  New York, and those who are courageously
battling substance abuse disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fentanyl overdose is a national public health crisis;  each
and  every  day,  people  of all genders, races, ages, and socioeconomic
status are dying at alarming rates due to  illegally  made  fentanyl,  a
dangerous synthetic opioid; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fentanyl  is  cheap, potent and profitable, and therefore,
continues to be found in a wide  variety  of  drugs,  including  heroin,
cocaine,  methamphetamine,  and  illicitly  manufactured  pills, some of
which are meant to mimic benzodiazepines, Molly/MDMA,  and  prescription
pain killers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fentanyl  is  involved  in more American youth drug deaths
than heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and prescription
drugs combined; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fentanyl is involved in more deaths of Americans  under  50
than  any other cause of death, including heart disease, cancer, and all
other accidents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Criminal drug networks are  mass-producing  fentanyl  pills
and falsely labeling and marketing them as legitimate prescription pills
to  deceive  the  American  public,  and  40%  of  those  seized  by law
enforcement contain a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl; and
 
  WHEREAS, These  fentanyl  pills  falsely  labeled  and  marketed  as
legitimate  prescription  pills  have  been  found  in all 50 states and
individuals  should  assume  any  prescription  medicine,  including
Oxycodone, Percocet, and Xanax, found online is fake; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious epidemic, and more must be done to  increase  activity  and
knowledge  at  the local, state, and national levels to educate, support
and protect those afflicted as well as their  families  and  caregivers;
now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 9, 2023,  as  Fentanyl
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
