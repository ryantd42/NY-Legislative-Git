  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
150th Anniversary of the Village of Horseheads Fire  Department  and  to
honor  its  past  and present firefighting members for 150 years of fire
protection to  the  citizens  of  the  Village  of  Horseheads  and  its
surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion will be celebrated with a myriad
of events throughout 2023, including the rededication of the Fire  Alarm

a  firefighter's  water  ball competition, a parade, live entertainment,
food vendors, and culminating  with  a  fireworks  display  on  Saturday
night; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  a  fire  destroyed  most  of  the  buildings in the
business district in 1872, a group of citizens from the Village who were
concerned there was no fire district gathered  to  form  the  Horseheads
Fire Department in July of 1873; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  the  years,  the  Department consisted of Steamer

  WHEREAS, Since its inception, more than 1,136  men  and  women  have
served  the citizens of the Village of Horseheads as well as neighboring
towns and villages in both New York and Pennsylvania; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection  services in every locality of our State; during the past 150
years, the  courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of  the  Village  of
Horseheads Fire Department have valiantly responded to all types of fire
emergencies  and  have won the praise and respect of the community which
they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
the  Village  of  Horseheads  Fire Department in public service and fire
protection is one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for 365 days a year,
for 150 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these noble  volunteers  left
their homes and went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters of the Village of Horseheads Fire
Department are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the Village of Horseheads Fire Department
reflects the history and development of firefighting over the  past  150
years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities, and  acknowledge  publicly  the  heroic
good  works  performed  by  the volunteer fire departments of this great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the 150th Anniversary of the Village of Horseheads
Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Village of Horseheads Fire Department.
