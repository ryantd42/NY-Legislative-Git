  COMMEMORATING  the  Asian  American  community's
  celebration of Songkran on April 13-15, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body  to  honor,  with
pleasure  and  great pride, the Asian American community of the State of
New York upon the occasion of the celebration of Songkran; and
 
  WHEREAS, Songkran is Thailand's most famous festival;  an  important
event  on the Buddhist calendar, this water festival marks the beginning
of the traditional Thai New Year; and
 
  WHEREAS, The name  Songkran  comes  from  a  Sanskrit  word  meaning
'passing'  or 'approaching'; Buddha images are bathed, and younger Thais
show respect to monks and elders by sprinkling water over their hands as
it is believed the water of Songkran will wash the bad  luck  and  bring
good fortune for them and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Songkran  Festival takes place in April every year, during
which time crowds of people  roam  around  throwing  buckets  of  water,
soaking  anyone  in  the  vicinity;  appreciation  of  family is another
important aspect of the festival, with many Thai people making their way
to their hometowns to spend time with older relatives; and
 
  WHEREAS, April 13th, the first day of the new year, is known as Song
Nam Phra (Pouring Water on Monks) Day; traditionally, Thais perform  the
Rod  Nam  Dum  Hua  ritual  on  the  first day of Songkran, the National
Elderly Day; during this ritual, young people pour fragrant  water  into
their  elders'  palms  as  a  gesture  of  humility and to ask for their
blessings; and
 
  WHEREAS, April 14th, known as Wan Nao, celebrates the old  Thai  New
Year's Eve; this is also National Family Day when everyone is encouraged
to  spend  quality  time  with  their  families; the New Year officially
begins on April 15th, also known as Wan Payawan (Bathing Buddha) Day; on
this day, there are parties and celebrations  everywhere,  with  ongoing
water fights, concerts, street food, and family gathering; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Songkran  was  originally  Thailand's  New  Year's Day and
signified the start  of  the  Thai  calendar;  between  1888  and  1940,
Songkran and New Year's Day in Thailand was celebrated on April 1st, but
was later changed to April 13-15th, when January 1st became synchronized
across the world as New Year's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to Thailand, Songkran is celebrated in Laos,
Cambodia, Burma, the Tai ethnic minority  of  Vietnam,  and  in  China's
Yunnan  province,  as  well  as  in  Sri  Lanka and other eastern Indian
countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many traditional activities held during  Songkran
Festival,  including  the  famous  water  splashing, cleaning houses and
Buddha statues, merit-making in temples, as well as exciting street  and
beach Songkran parties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  during  Songkran  Festival Thai people go to
temples and offer food and clothing to the monks  and  listen  to  their
Buddhist  preaching;  they  also  release  birds  and fish back to their
natural habitats; this practice of giving freedom to living creatures is
part  of their Buddhist belief that releasing animals to freedom returns
good fortune; and
 
  WHEREAS, Folk performances and games  are  organized  for  enjoyment
during  Songkran;  there are Thai beauty pageant competitions displaying
traditional Thai dress, as well as street parades; sand is also  brought
to  temple  grounds  and  can  be  used  to build sand pagodas or repair
temples; helping monks with  temple  maintenance  is  regarded  as  good
practice during Songkran Festival; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  distinguished  beauty  of  the  Asian culture and the
contribution of its people in business and the economy as well as in the
arts and sciences has left substantial impacts on our global  community;
the  contributions  of  Asian Americans are particularly esteemed within
this great Empire State and are acknowledged for their outstanding merit
and value; and
 
  WHEREAS, Recognizing the significance of their contributions to  the
City  and the State of New York, this Legislative Body is proud to honor
all  New  Yorkers  of  Asian  ancestry,  joining  with  them  in  their
celebration of Songkran; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the Asian American community's celebration  of  Songkran  on
April 13-15, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to distinguished members of the Asian American community.
