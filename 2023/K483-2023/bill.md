  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 12, 2023, as Provider Appreciation  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body that those
individuals who faithfully serve the needs  of  the  community  and  its
citizens  with  steadfast  dedication  and  compassionate  commitment
profoundly strengthen our shared  commitment  to  family  and  community
life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
longstanding traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12, 2023, as Provider
Appreciation Day in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Provider Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  year since 1996, the Friday before Mother's Day has
been celebrated nationally as Provider Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Provider Appreciation Day recognizes child care  providers,
teachers  and  other  educators  of  young children everywhere for their
tireless efforts caring for and teaching children  of  working  parents;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Child care providers keep our children safe, nurture their
curiosity, and prepare them for a lifetime of learning and growth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Child care providers offer an  individualized  approach  to
learning  for multiple age groups, advocating for children and families,
and  demonstrating  continuity  of  care  for  parents  who  work
non-traditional hours, while operating and owning small businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thanks  to  child  care  providers, parents can go to work
without worrying about  their  child's  safety,  social,  and  emotional
well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the midst of one of the most significant health crises
in modern history, we recognize the  importance  and  tireless  work  of
child care providers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  state has an estimated 10,253 family child care
homes (including group family), and 6,908 centers that tend to and  care
for  776,021  children;  approximately  7,263  legally-exempt child care
providers oversaw the needs of about 27,034 children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Provider Appreciation Day recognizes an  integral  part  of
our  child  care system that often goes overlooked; it also commends all
child care providers,  school-age  program  staff,  educators,  and  all
others who care for our young children, for their passion sustaining the
prosperity of our nation's next generation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
 
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12, 2023, as  Provider
Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
