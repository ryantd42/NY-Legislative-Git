  SEAWRIGHT, SIMON, COLTON -- read once and referred to the Committee on
  Labor
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the labor law and the state administrative procedure
  act, in relation to enacting the nail salon minimum standards  council
  act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "nail salon
 minimum standards council act".
  § 2. The labor law is amended by adding a new article 19-E to read  as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 19-E
  NAIL SALON MINIMUM STANDARDS COUNCIL ACT
 SECTION 697.  STATEMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY.
  697-A. DEFINITIONS.
  697-B. NAIL SALON MINIMUM STANDARDS COUNCIL.
  697-C. MINIMUM PRICING COMMITTEE.
  697-D. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COUNCIL.
  697-E. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSIONER WITH RESPECT TO THE
  COUNCIL.
  697-F. LABOR PROTECTIONS.
  697-G. FUTURE MEETINGS.
  697-H. SEVERABILITY.
  697-I. PREEMPTION.
  §  697.  STATEMENT  OF PUBLIC POLICY. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND
 DECLARES THAT THERE ARE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE NAIL SALON  INDUSTRY  IN
 THE  STATE  OF  NEW  YORK AT WAGES AND STANDARDS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE
 ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND ADEQUATE HEALTH PROTECTIONS FOR THEMSELVES  AND
 THEIR  FAMILIES.  SUCH  EMPLOYMENT:  IMPAIRS THE HEALTH, EFFICIENCY, AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 WELL-BEING OF SUCH WORKERS; CONSTITUTES UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST OTHER
 EMPLOYERS AND THEIR WORKERS; THREATENS THE STABILITY  OF  THE  INDUSTRY;
 REDUCES  THE  PURCHASING  POWER  OF  WORKERS;  AND  REQUIRES,  IN  MANY
 INSTANCES,  THAT  WAGES  BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE PAYMENT OF PUBLIC MONEYS
 FOR RELIEF OR OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ASSISTANCE.  DOCUMENTED  INAPPRO-
 PRIATE  WORKING  CONDITIONS  INCLUDE  THE  FOLLOWING:  EXPOSURE TO KNOWN
 CARCINOGENS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CAUSE CANCER, ASTHMA, AND  REPRODUC-
 TIVE  HEALTH  ISSUES FOR NAIL SALON WORKERS; LONG HOURS IN POORLY VENTI-
 LATED AREAS; UNPREDICTABLE WORK SCHEDULES  THAT  ADVERSELY  AFFECT  NAIL
 SALON  WORKERS'  ABILITY  TO  ACT  AS  CAREGIVERS  TO  THEIR DEPENDENTS;
 NONSTANDARD PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING CERTIFICATIONS; INCONSISTENT STAND-
 ARDS AND CRITERIA FOR WORK PERFORMED BY TRAINEES; AND HIGH RATES OF WAGE
 THEFT.  THE  CURRENT  SYSTEM  OF  RELYING  EXCLUSIVELY  ON  INDIVIDUAL
 COMPLAINTS  TO  THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE AT CREATING INDUS-
 TRY-WIDE COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS NOW IN EFFECT. INTENSE  COMPETITION
 ON  PRICE HAS DRIVEN DOWN STANDARDS TO THE DETRIMENT OF WORKERS, CONSUM-
 ERS, AND EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES. DATA HAS SHOWN THAT  THERE  IS  A  STRONG
 CORRELATION  BETWEEN  PRICES  AND WAGE VIOLATIONS: THE LOWER THE PRICES,
 THE HIGHER THE RATES OF WAGE VIOLATIONS THAT OCCUR IN NAIL  SALONS.  DUE
 TO  SLIM  PROFIT  MARGINS  AND  INTENSE INDUSTRY COMPETITION, EVEN SMALL
 BUSINESSES WISHING TO INCREASE PAY AND IMPROVE  WORKING  CONDITIONS  ARE
 UNABLE  TO  DO  SO.  IT  IS  IMPERATIVE  THAT  SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS BE
 CORRECTED AND REGULATED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO INSTALL A MECHANISM TO RAISE  INDUS-
 TRY  STANDARDS  FOR  NAIL SALON WORKERS, OWNERS, AND CUSTOMERS THROUGH A
 PARTICIPATORY AND ACCESSIBLE PROCESS AND TO SET  THE  FOUNDATION  FOR  A
 THRIVING, STABLE, AND SUSTAINABLE NAIL SALON INDUSTRY IN NEW YORK.
  ACCORDINGLY,  IT  IS THE DECLARED POLICY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT
 INAPPROPRIATE CONDITIONS BE ELIMINATED AS RAPIDLY AS PRACTICABLE WITHOUT
 SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAILING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT OR EARNING  POWER.
 TO THIS END, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A NAIL SALON MINIMUM STAN-
 DARDS  COUNCIL  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION SIX HUNDRED NINETY-SEVEN-B OF THIS
 ARTICLE, TO INVESTIGATE AND RECOMMEND MINIMUM WAGES AND STANDARDS IN THE
 NAIL SALON INDUSTRY, AND THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH AND  IMPLEMENT
 AND  MAINTAIN  SUCH  WAGES AND STANDARDS.  FURTHERMORE, THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL CONVENE AN  INDEPENDENT  MINIMUM  PRICING  COMMITTEE  PURSUANT  TO
 SECTION  SIX  HUNDRED NINETY-SEVEN-C OF THIS ARTICLE TO DETERMINE A FAIR
 MINIMUM PRICING MODEL THAT WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE  MAINTENANCE  FOR  NAIL
 SALON  WORKERS  AND PROTECT CONSUMER AND WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY STAND-
 ARDS WHILE MAINTAINING BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AUTONOMY  AND  A  COMPETITIVE
 MARKETPLACE.
  THE  COMMISSIONER  AND THE NAIL SALON MINIMUM STANDARDS COUNCIL ESTAB-
 LISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION SIX HUNDRED NINETY-SEVEN-B  OF  THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL  HAVE THE POWER TO INVESTIGATE THE WAGES AND STANDARDS FOR WORKERS
 IN THE NAIL SALON INDUSTRY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE  MINIMUM  WAGES  AND
 STANDARDS  ESTABLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE
 ARE SUFFICIENT TO  PROVIDE  ADEQUATE  MAINTENANCE  AND  ADEQUATE  HEALTH
 PROTECTIONS  FOR  NAIL SALON WORKERS, CONSUMERS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
 THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS THAT PROVISIONS OF  THIS  ARTICLE  MAY  HAVE
 ANTI-COMPETITIVE EFFECTS, AND ENACTS THIS ARTICLE WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF
 ITS  POSSIBLE  ANTI-COMPETITIVE  EFFECTS AND WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENTION
 THAT ALL CONDUCT AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE RECEIVE IMMUNITY FROM FEDER-
 AL ANTITRUST LAWS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.
