 YEAR  SUCH  CREDIT  IS  ALLOWED,  ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER FIFTEENTH OF SUCH

 INFORMATION  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  COMMISSIONER ON THE TAXPAYER'S PERSONAL
 INCOME TAX RETURN FILED FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR  TWO  YEARS  PRIOR  TO  THE
 TAXABLE  YEAR  IN WHICH SUCH CREDIT IS ALLOWED. FOR THOSE TAXPAYERS WHOM

 AMOUNT  THAT  WAS DUE TO HIM OR HER, MAY REQUEST PAYMENT OF SUCH CLAIMED
 DEFICIENCY IN A MANNER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSIONER.
