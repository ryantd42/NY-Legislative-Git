 follows:
  (b)  The  department of transportation, for the purposes of this chap-
 ter, shall develop criteria to  determine  a  highway  providing  access
 between  qualifying  highways  and terminals, facilities for food, fuel,
 repairs, and rest and, in addition, for points of loading and  unloading
 for  household  goods  carriers.  The  department may, by order, rule or
 regulation, designate public highways within the state as  access  high-
 ways. The department of transportation, upon the request of the legisla-

 ways,  or  of  a town board may, by order, rule or regulation, designate
 other city or village  streets,  or  county  roads,  or  town  highways,
 respectively,  as  access highways. Before designating any county, town,
 city or village, street or highway as an access highway[,]:
  (I) the commissioner of transportation shall notify  the  municipality
 having  jurisdiction  over  such  street or highway of the need for such
 local access road and solicit comments thereon.  If  objections  to  the
 designation  are  filed  by  the municipality having jurisdiction over a
 particular street or highway, the commissioner of  transportation  shall
 set,  as  soon  as  practicable,  a public informational meeting. If the
 commissioner of transportation finds, after holding  a  public  informa-
 tional  meeting, that his proposed designation is proper and reasonable,
 prior to filing a notice of agency action he shall so notify the munici-
