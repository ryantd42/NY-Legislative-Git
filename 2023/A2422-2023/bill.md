  (iii)  such  maximum  age  requirement  of thirty-five years shall not
 apply to any police officer of any county, town, city or village  police
 force  not  otherwise  provided for in this section if the eligible list
 has been exhausted and there are no other eligible candidates; provided,
 however,  the police officer themselves are on the eligible list of such
 county, town, city or village and meet all other requirements  of  merit
 and  fitness set forth by this chapter and do not exceed the maximum age
 of thirty-nine];
  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 58 of the civil service law, as  amended
 by chapter 244 of the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  The provisions of this section shall not prevent any county, city,
 town, village, housing authority, transit authority, police district  or
 the  department of environmental conservation from setting more restric-
 tive requirements of eligibility for its police  officers[,  except  the
 maximum  age  to  be  a  police  officer as provided in paragraph (a) of
 subdivision one of this section].
  § 3. Subdivision 4 of section 58 of the civil service  law,  as  sepa-
 rately  amended  by chapters 375 and 397 of the laws of 1990, paragraphs
 (a) and (b) as amended by chapter 561 of the laws of 2015, paragraph (c)
 as amended by chapter 190 of the laws of 2008 and subparagraphs (ii) and
 (iv) of paragraph (c) as amended by section 58 of subpart B of part C of
 chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, is amended to read as follows:
  4.  (a) [Any person who has received provisional or permanent appoint-
 ment in the competitive class of the civil service as a  police  officer
 of  the  regional  state  park  police, the state university of New York
 police, the department of environmental conservation or any police force
 or police department of any county, city, town, village, housing author-
 ity, transit authority or police district shall be  eligible  to  resign
 from  any  police  force  or police department, and to be appointed as a
 police officer in the same or any other police force or  police  depart-
 ment  without satisfying the age requirements set forth in paragraph (a)
 of subdivision one of this section at the time of such second or  subse-
 quent appointment, provided such second or subsequent appointment occurs
 within thirty days of the date of resignation.
  (b)  Any  person who has received permanent appointment in the compet-
 itive class of the civil service as a police  officer  of  the  regional
 state  park police, the state university of New York police, the depart-
 ment of environmental conservation or any police force or police depart-
 ment of any county, city,  town,  village,  housing  authority,  transit
 authority or police district shall be eligible to resign from any police
 force  or  police department and, subject to such civil service rules as
 may be applicable, shall be  eligible  for  reinstatement  in  the  same
 police force or police department or in any other police force or police
 department  to which he or she was eligible for transfer, without satis-
 fying the age requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision one
 of this section at the time of such reinstatement, provided  such  rein-
 statement occurs within one year of the date of resignation.
  (c)  (i)] Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature hereby
 finds and declares that it  is  frequently  impracticable  to  ascertain
 fitness  for  the positions of detective and investigator within various
 police or sheriffs departments around the state by means  of  a  compet-
 itive  examination  due  to the unique nature of the duties assigned and
 the intangible personal qualities needed to  perform  such  duties.  The
 legislature  further  finds  that competitive examination has never been
 employed in many police, correction or sheriffs departments,  to  ascer-
 tain fitness for the positions of detective and investigator within such
 A. 2422  3
 
 police, correction or sheriffs departments; such fitness has always been
 determined  by  evaluation of the capabilities of an individual (who has
 in any case received permanent appointment to  the  position  of  police
 officer, correction officer of any rank or deputy sheriff) by superviso-
 ry  personnel.  The  legislature  further  finds  that an individual who
 performs in an investigatory position in a manner sufficiently satisfac-
 tory to the appropriate supervisors to hold such  an  assignment  for  a
 period  of eighteen months, has demonstrated fitness for the position of
 detective or investigator within such  police,  correction  or  sheriffs
 department  at least as sufficiently as could be ascertained by means of
 a competitive examination.
  [(ii)] (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in  any  juris-
 diction,  other  than a city with a population of one million or more or
 the state department of corrections  and  community  supervision,  which
 does  not administer examinations for designation to detective or inves-
 tigator, any person who has received permanent appointment to the  posi-
 tion of police officer, correction officer of any rank or deputy sheriff
 and is temporarily assigned to perform the duties of detective or inves-
 tigator  shall, whenever such assignment to the duties of a detective or
 investigator exceeds eighteen months, be  permanently  designated  as  a
 detective  or  investigator and receive the compensation ordinarily paid
 to persons in such designation.
  [(iii)] (C) Nothing contained in [subparagraph (ii)] PARAGRAPH (B)  of
 this  [paragraph] SUBDIVISION  shall be construed to limit any jurisdic-
 tion's ability to administer examinations for appointment to  the  posi-
 tions  of  detective  and investigator, provided however that any person
 temporarily assigned to perform the duties of detective or  investigator
 within  the  period  commencing September twenty-third, nineteen hundred
 ninety-three through and including the date upon  which  this  paragraph
 shall  have  become a law and who has not been designated as a detective
 or investigator and who has not been subject to an examination for which
 there is a certified eligible list, shall be permanently designated as a
 detective or investigator whenever such  assignment  to  the  duties  of
 detective or investigator exceeds eighteen months.
  [(iv)]  (D)  Detectives  and  investigators designated since September
 twenty-third, nineteen hundred ninety  and  prior  to  February  twenty-
 fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-five by any state, county, town, village
 or  city  (other than a city with a population of one million or more or
 the state department of corrections and community  supervision)  police,
 correction  or  sheriffs  department, pursuant to the provisions of this
 paragraph in effect during such period, who continue to  serve  in  such
 positions,  shall  retain their detective or investigator status without
 any right to retroactive financial entitlement.
  § 4. Subdivision 3 of section 215 of the executive law, as amended  by
 chapter 478 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  The  sworn members of the New York state police shall be appointed
 by the superintendent and permanent appointees may  be  removed  by  the
 superintendent only after a hearing. No person shall be appointed to the
 New  York state police force as a sworn member unless he or she shall be
 a citizen of the United States, [between the ages of] AND AT LEAST twen-
 ty-one [and  twenty-nine  years  except  that  in  the  superintendent's
 discretion,  the  maximum  age  may  be  extended  to thirty-five years.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any general or special law
 to the contrary the time spent on military duty, not exceeding  a  total
 of  six years, shall be subtracted from the age of any applicant who has
 passed his or her twenty-ninth  birthday,  solely  for  the  purpose  of
 A. 2422  4

 permitting  qualification as to age and for no other purpose. Such limi-
 tations as to age however shall not apply to persons  appointed  to  the
 positions  of  counsel,  first assistant counsel, assistant counsel, and
 assistant deputy superintendent for employee relations nor to any person
 appointed  to  the  bureau of criminal investigation pursuant to section
 two hundred sixteen of this article nor] YEARS OF  AGE.  NOR  shall  any
 person  be appointed unless he or she has fitness and good moral charac-
 ter and shall have passed a physical and mental examination  based  upon
 standards  provided  by the rules and regulations of the superintendent.
 Appointments shall be made for a probationary period which, in the  case
 of  appointees  required to attend and complete a basic training program
 at the state police academy, shall include such time spent attending the
 basic school and terminate one year after successful completion thereof.
 All other sworn members shall be subject to a probationary period of one
 year from the date of appointment. Following satisfactory completion  of
 the  probationary  period  the  member  shall  be a permanent appointee.
 Voluntary resignation or withdrawal  from  the  New  York  state  police
 during  such  appointment  shall  be submitted to the superintendent for
 approval.  Reasonable time shall be required to account for  all  equip-
 ment  issued  or  for debts or obligations to the state to be satisfied.
 Resignation or withdrawal from the division during a time of  emergency,
 so  declared  by  the governor, shall not be approved if contrary to the
 best interest of the state and shall be a misdemeanor. No  sworn  member
 removed  from the New York state police shall be eligible for reappoint-
 ment. The superintendent shall make rules  and  regulations  subject  to
 approval  by the governor for the discipline and control of the New York
 state police and for the examination and  qualifications  of  applicants
 for  appointment  as members thereto and such examinations shall be held
 and conducted by the superintendent subject  to  such  rules  and  regu-
 lations.  The  superintendent  is  authorized  to charge a fee of twenty
 dollars as an application fee for any person applying to take a  compet-
 itive examination for the position of trooper, and a fee of five dollars
 for any competitive examination for a civilian position. The superinten-
 dent  shall promulgate regulations subject to the approval of the direc-
 tor of the budget, to provide for a waiver of the application  fee  when
 the  fee  would  cause  an unreasonable hardship on the applicant and to
 establish a fee schedule and charge fees for the  use  of  state  police
 facilities.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
