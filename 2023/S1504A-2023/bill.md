 section  384-d  of  the  retirement and social security law, who between
 July 30, 2007 and January 5, 2014 was employed by the Erie County  Sher-
 iff's  Department  where he was a member of the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system, and who, for reasons not ascribable to his
 own negligence, was not granted service credit under  section  384-d  of
 the retirement and social security law for his period of employment with
 the  Erie  County  Sheriff's  Department,  shall be granted such service

 this act shall be borne by the Town of Hamburg.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

 deputy  sheriff in Erie County. Currently, deputy sheriff service is not
 creditable in a NYSLPFRS twenty-year police retirement plan.

 will  be  borne by the Town of Hamburg as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  This bill will not increase the future  annual  contributions  of  the
 Town of Hamburg.
