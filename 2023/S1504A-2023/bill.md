 section 384-d of the retirement and social  security  law,  who  between
 July  30, 2007 and January 5, 2014 was employed by the Erie County Sher-
 iff's Department where he was a member of the New York state  and  local
 employees' retirement system, and who, for reasons not ascribable to his
 own  negligence,  was  not granted service credit under section 384-d of
 the retirement and social security law for his period of employment with
 the Erie County Sheriff's Department,  shall  be  granted  such  service
 credit under section 384-d of the retirement and social security law and

 this act shall be borne by the Town of Hamburg.

 of  the  New  York  State  and  Local  Police and Fire Retirement System
 (NYSLPFRS) employed by the Town of Hamburg, for the period of  July  30,
 2007  through January 5, 2014, during which time they were employed as a
 deputy  sheriff in Erie County. Currently, deputy sheriff service is not
 creditable in a NYSLPFRS twenty-year police retirement plan.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  there
 will  be  an immediate past service cost of approximately $420,000 which
 will be borne by the Town of Hamburg as a one-time payment.  This  esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 Town of Hamburg.
