  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2023, as Alpha-1  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
diseases that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2023, as Alpha-1
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Alpha-1 Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alpha-1  Antitrypsin  Deficiency  (Alpha-1)  is  a genetic
condition which may result in serious lung disease or liver disease;  it
occurs  when  there  is  a  severe lack of a protein in the blood called
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) which is mainly produced by the liver; and
 
  WHEREAS, The main function of AAT  is  to  protect  the  lungs  from
inflammation  caused  by infection and inhaled irritants such as tobacco
smoke; the low level of AAT in the  blood  occurs  because  the  AAT  is
abnormal  and cannot be released from the liver at the normal rate; this
leads to a buildup of abnormal AAT in the liver which  can  cause  liver
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People with Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually develop
the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between ages 20 and 50; the
earliest symptoms are  shortness  of  breath  following  mild  activity,
reduced ability to exercise, and wheezing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Other  signs and symptoms can include unintentional weight
loss, recurring respiratory infections,  fatigue,  and  rapid  heartbeat
upon standing; affected individuals often develop emphysema; and
 
  WHEREAS,  About  10  percent  of  infants with Alpha-1 develop liver
disease; approximately 15 percent of adults will  develop  liver  damage
due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver; and
 
  WHEREAS, In rare cases, people with Alpha-1 develop a skin condition
called  panniculitis,  which  is  characterized  by  hardened  skin with
painful lumps or patches; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are treatments and  preventative  measures  that  may
slow  the  progression  of  lung  disease and help take control of one's
health; the specific therapy for the treatment of Alpha-1  related  lung
disease is augmentation therapy, the use of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Alpha-1  Foundation  Support  Group  Network  is  a
collective of more than  80  affiliated  support  groups,  dedicated  to
providing  support,  education  and  information  to  people affected by
Alpha-1, and to extending the mission of the Alpha-1 Foundation; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the luminous leadership of Richard Lovrich, Capital
Region of New  York  Alpha-1  Support  Group  helps  people  develop  an
enhanced, healthier sense of personal identity and a connection with the
large Alpha-1 community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2023, as  Alpha-1
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York  and  Richard  Lovrich,  Leader  of New York Capital Region Alpha-1
Support Group.
