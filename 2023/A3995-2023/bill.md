 the criminal procedure law, as amended by section 1 of subpart C of part
 UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  When  a  principal, whose future court attendance at a criminal action
 or proceeding is or may be required, comes under the control of a court,
 such court shall, in accordance with this title,  by  a  securing  order
 release  the  principal on the principal's own recognizance, release the
 principal under non-monetary conditions, or, where authorized, fix  bail
 or  commit  the  principal  to  the  custody of the sheriff. In all such
 cases, except where another type  of  securing  order  is  shown  to  be
 required  by  law,  OR UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY LAW, the court shall
 release the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance,
 unless it is demonstrated and the court makes an individualized determi-
 nation that the principal poses a risk of flight to  avoid  prosecution.
 If  such a finding is made, the court must, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY
 LAW, select the least restrictive alternative and  condition  or  condi-
 tions  that will reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  The
 court shall explain its choice of release, release with conditions, bail
 or remand on the record or in writing. In making its determination,  the
 court  must  consider  and take into account available information about
 the principal, including:
