  read once and referred to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  establishing the "pollution justice act of 2023"  and  implementing  a
  plan to replace peaker plants with renewable energy systems
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "pollution
 justice act of 2023".
  §  2.  Article  19 of the environmental conservation law is amended by
 adding a new title 13 to read as follows:
  TITLE 13
  PEAKER PLANTS
 SECTION 19-1301. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
  19-1303. DEFINITIONS.
  19-1305. MANDATORY REPLACEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.
  19-1307. EXTENSIONS FOR CAUSE.
  19-1309. PROHIBITIONS.
  19-1311. EXEMPTIONS.
 § 19-1301. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
  1. ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS THAT GENERALLY OPERATE DURING PERIODS  OF
 PEAK  ELECTRICITY  DEMAND ARE KNOWN AS PEAKER PLANTS. MANY PEAKER PLANTS
 IN THE STATE ARE OLDER FOSSIL  FUEL-FIRED  UNITS  THAT  EMIT  GREENHOUSE
 GASES  AND  A  VARIETY  OF OTHER HARMFUL AIR POLLUTANTS INCLUDING SULFUR
 OXIDES, NITROGEN OXIDES, PARTICULATES AND MERCURY.
  2. A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEAKER PLANTS ARE LOCATED IN OR ADJACENT TO
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF  NEW  YORK  THAT  ALREADY  BEAR
 DISPROPORTIONATE  POLLUTION BURDENS DUE TO A HISTORY OF SITING POLLUTION
 SOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 522  2
 
  3. POLLUTANTS FROM PEAKER  PLANTS  CONTRIBUTE  TO  SIGNIFICANT  PUBLIC
 HEALTH PROBLEMS. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND
 MENTAL  HYGIENE'S  AIR  POLLUTION  AND THE HEALTH OF NEW YORKERS REPORT:
 "EACH YEAR, PM2.5 POLLUTION IN (NEW YORK CITY) CAUSES  MORE  THAN  3,000
 DEATHS,  2,000  HOSPITAL  ADMISSIONS  FOR LUNG AND HEART CONDITIONS, AND
 APPROXIMATELY 6,000 EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR ASTHMA  IN  CHILDREN
 AND  ADULTS."  ACCORDING  TO  THE REPORT, EACH YEAR EXPOSURES TO OZONE
 CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS CAUSE AN ESTIMATED "400 PREMATURE
 DEATHS, 850 HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR ASTHMA AND 4,500  EMERGENCY  DEPARTMENT
 VISITS FOR ASTHMA."
  4. PEAKER PLANTS OFTEN OPERATE DURING SUMMER MONTHS WHEN AIR POLLUTION
 LEVELS ARE HIGHEST AND THEIR EMISSIONS ADD TO EXISTING POLLUTION BURDENS
 IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN
 THOSE COMMUNITIES FROM AIR POLLUTION.
 § 19-1303. DEFINITIONS.
  1. "ADJACENT TO" SHALL MEAN WITHIN A RADIUS OF ONE MILE FROM THE PLANT
 PROPERTY BOUNDARY.
  2.  "DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN SUBDI-
 VISION FIVE OF SECTION 75-0101 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  3. "OPERATING PERMIT" SHALL HAVE THE MEANING SET FORTH IN  SUBDIVISION
 EIGHTEEN OF SECTION 19-0107 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  4.  "RENEWABLE  ENERGY  SYSTEMS"  SHALL  HAVE THE MEANING SET FORTH IN
 SECTION SIXTY-SIX-P OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE  FIRM
 ZERO EMISSION RESOURCES SUCH AS LONG-DURATION ENERGY STORAGE.
  5.  "REPLACE" OR "REPLACEMENT" MEANS THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF
 A RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM OR TRANSMISSION AND  DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUC-
 TURE  THAT  ENABLES THE PROVISION OF THE EQUIVALENT MAXIMUM ANNUAL POWER
 OUTPUT ACHIEVED BY THE REPLACEABLE PEAKER PLANT DURING ANY  SINGLE  YEAR
 DURING THE TEN YEARS PRECEDING THE SUBMISSION OF AN APPLICATION TO RENEW
 AN OPERATING PERMIT.
  6. "REPLACEABLE PEAKER PLANT" MEANS A MAJOR ELECTRIC GENERATING FACIL-
 ITY  AS  DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 19-0312 OF
 THIS ARTICLE THAT BURNS COAL, OIL, DIESEL OR NATURAL GAS AND WAS  OPERA-
 TIONAL  AND  GENERATED ELECTRICITY LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE YEAR
 DURING AT LEAST TWO YEARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TEN THROUGH TWO  THOUSAND
 NINETEEN  AND THAT IS LOCATED IN OR ADJACENT TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNI-
 TY.
 § 19-1305. MANDATORY REPLACEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.

 YEARS;
  C. THE FUEL OR FUELS UTILIZED BY SUCH PLANT TO GENERATE POWER;
  D.  A  PROPOSED  STRATEGY  TO  REPLACE THE PLANT WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY
 SYSTEMS. THE STRATEGY SHALL, AT A MINIMUM, SET FORTH THE TYPE  OR  TYPES
 OF  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  SYSTEMS  TO BE UTILIZED, THE PROPOSED LOCATION OR
 LOCATIONS OF SUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS, AND THE ELECTRIC  GENERATING
 CAPACITY OF SUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS;
  E. A TIMETABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED REPLACEMENT STRATEGY
 THAT SHALL NOT EXCEED FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF RENEWAL OF THE OPERAT-
 A. 522  3
 
 ING  PERMIT  AND THAT SHALL ENSURE THAT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE
