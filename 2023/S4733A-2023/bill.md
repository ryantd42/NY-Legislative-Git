  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Section 14-106 of the election law, as amended by  chapter
 454 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  §  14-106.  Political  communication. 1. The statements required to be
 filed under the provisions of this article next  succeeding  a  primary,
 general or special election shall be accompanied by a copy of all broad-
 cast,  cable  or  satellite  schedules  and  scripts,  paid  internet or
 digital, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS MADE BY INDIVIDUALS BEING PAID  BY
 THE CAMPAIGN, print and other types of advertisements, pamphlets, circu-
 lars,  flyers, brochures, letterheads and other printed matter purchased
 or produced, and reproductions of statements or information published to
 five hundred or more members of a general public audience by computer or

 authority  of  the  person  filing the statement or the committee or the
 person on whose behalf it is filed, as the case  may  be.  Such  copies,
 schedules and scripts shall be preserved by the officer with whom or the
 board  with  which  it  is required to be filed for a period of one year

 tical committee which made the expenditure for such  political  communi-
 cation.  The  disclosure on printed or digital political communications,
 including but not limited to brochures, flyers,  posters,  mailings,  or
 internet  advertising,  INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS MADE BY INDIVIDUALS
 BEING PAID BY THE CAMPAIGN, shall be printed or typed in an  appropriate
 legible  form to read as follows: "Paid for by:" followed by the name of
 the political committee making the expenditure. The disclosure  on  non-
 printed or digital political communications shall clearly and prominent-
 ly  display  and/or  speak  the  following  statement:  "Paid for by:"
 followed by the name of the political committee making the  expenditure.
 In  the  case  of  a political communication that is not visual, such as
 radio or automated telephone calls, clearly speaking the statement  will
 satisfy the requirements of this section.
  3.  Political  communications  that  are  considered promotional items
 which support a particular candidate, election, ballot measure or  issue
 and  limit  the  content  of communication to the name, office and brief
 message of support, shall be exempt from the provisions  of  subdivision
 two  of this section. Promotional items shall be items that are of nomi-
 nal value and are distributed to the general  public  in  an  effort  to
 promote  a  particular  candidate,  election,  ballot  measure  or issue
 including but not limited to pens, bumper stickers, yard signs, buttons,
 shirts, bags or balloons.
  4. Political communication that  is  considered  digital  media  which
 advertises for a particular candidate, election, ballot measure or issue
 which  limits the content of communication to the name, office and brief
 message shall not be subject to the provisions  of  subdivision  two  of
 this  section  if  such digital media is unable to contain the "paid for
 by" statement due to its small size  and  contains  a  link  to  another
 webpage  where  the  "paid  for  by" statement is prominently displayed.
 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS MADE ON BEHALF OF A PARTICULAR  CANDIDATE,  ELECTION,
 BALLOT  MEASURE OR OTHER ISSUE SHALL NOT BE EXEMPTED FROM THE PROVISIONS
 OF THIS SECTION.
  5. THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS IS AUTHORIZED TO PROMULGATE ADDITIONAL
 REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE METHOD OF FILING STATEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE
 PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. SUCH REGULATIONS SHALL BE PROMULGATED
 WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 2.  This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after  it  shall
 have become a law.
