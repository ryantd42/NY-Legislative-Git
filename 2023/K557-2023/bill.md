  College Golf Course in June of 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  the  quality
of  life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched by
the availability of exceptional recreational facilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Wells College  Golf  Course  of
Southern Cayuga County; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Wells  College  campus  is  home  to  a  meticulously
maintained  nine-hole  golf  facility  overlooking  Cayuga  Lake  which
according  to  documents  in  archives,  existed as a six-hole course as
early as 1890; during this time,  Wells  College  faculty  and  students
played  on the course with hand-dug holes near the present ball field on
the corner of Poplar Ridge Road and New York State Route 90; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1909, the current 'AA' house was the  clubhouse  of  the
incorporated  Aurora Country Club which was located on the north side of
Dublin Hill Road in the Village of Aurora; it  had  no  heat,  water  or
electricity  and they used Japanese lanterns for lighting the clubhouse;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1923, Kerr Duncan MacMillan, President of Wells  College
from  1913-1935  and an enthusiastic golfer, purchased the six-hole golf
course as part of a million-dollar development project;  the  clubhouse,
which was donated by Robert L. Zabriski, was moved from Dublin Hill Road
to its current location on campus, by rolling it on logs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1925-26,  the Athletic Clubhouse was reconditioned and
furnished, and the six-hole course was upgraded to  nine  holes  between
1925 and 1929; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Edward  Hayton  became  the  first  groundskeeper  and PGA
professional in 1938, and one year later  a  new  pro-shop  was  erected
close  to  the  first tee box, the course was lengthened, and sand traps
were built around some greens; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1960s, renowned golf architect and husband of  Wells
alumna  Robert  Trent  Jones redesigned several of the holes, with minor
upgrades made by his son in 1970; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout its distinguished 100-year  history,  the  Wells
College  Golf  Course  has  been  successfully managed by: Edward Hayton
(1936-1976); Mary VanDuyne  (1976-1992);  Jim  Boeff  (1993-2010);  Matt
Schooley  (2011-2016);  Rick  Wilson  (2017);  Rick Wilson and John Wade
(2018); John Wade and Scott Winkleman (2019); John Wade and  Jim  Button
(2020); and Kevin Fitzgerald and Brian Dugan (2021-present); and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the Wells College Golf Course has been home to
many  annual  golf  tournaments,  including  the  Hank  Carr Tournament,
 
Challenge Cup, H.R. Wilson Tournament, and the  Francis  Losurdo  Summer
Classic Tournament; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success of the Wells College Golf Course is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its managers, Kevin Fitzgerald  and  Brian
Dugan, as well as its dedicated members and staff, whose involvement is,
and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  remaining  true to its high standards and original
purpose, the Wells College Golf Course is one of the best  kept  secrets
of  the  County,  and  is  justly  proud of its noble history and firmly
committed to  a  future  of  healthful  recreational  activity  for  its
membership and community, while fostering a greater appreciation for all
of mankind's relationship to his natural environment; and now, therefore
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of  the  Wells  College  Golf  Course,
fully  confident  that  such  organizations provide the vehicle by which
progress is achieved in preserving the heritage of our community; and be
it further
