  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 17, 2023, as Ellis Island Family  History  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase  awareness  of  moments  in
history which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 17, 2023, as Ellis Island Family
History Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Ellis Island Family History Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ellis Island, in Upper New York Bay, was  the  gateway  for
millions  of  immigrants  to  the  United States as the nation's busiest
immigrant inspection station from 1892 until 1924; and
 
  WHEREAS, On this day in 1907, just under 12,000 names were  recorded
as  passing  through  Ellis  Island;  during  all of 1907, more than one
million immigrants were processed through Ellis Island; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 17, 2001, the first National Ellis  Island  Family
History  Day  was  observed;  it  was  by  official  proclamation of our
nation's governors that April 17 be designated as National Ellis  Island
Family History Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that there be greater awareness of the
history of our State and Nation, and  more  must  be  done  to  increase
awareness at the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 17, 2023,  as  Ellis
Island Family History Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
