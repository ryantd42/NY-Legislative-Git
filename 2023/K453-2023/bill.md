  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 2023, as Swiss-American Heritage Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the sense of  this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  2023,  as
Swiss-American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The late 18th and early 19th Century saw a  flow  of  Swiss
farmers  forming colonies especially in Russia and in the United States;
before the year 1820, some estimated  25,000  to  30,000  Swiss  entered
British  North  America;  most  of  them  settled  in regions of today's
Pennsylvania as well as both North and South Carolina; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the next seven  decades,  approximately  250,000
Swiss  arrived,  making their homes mainly in the Midwestern states such
as Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, and along the  Pacific  Coast;
today, there are approximately one million Swiss-Americans living in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Along  with the Swiss immigrants came their traditions; by
the late 1800s,  Swiss  Vereins  (Clubs)  were  established  to  provide
camaraderie  and  sharing  of  customs  and  traditions  of  the  Heimat
(Homeland); and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1890s, The William Tell Verein of  Oakland  and  the
Sacramento  Helvetia Verein were formed, and later, the West Coast Swiss
Wrestling Association was established to preserve the Swiss tradition of
Schwingen (Swiss wrestling); and
 
  WHEREAS, Swiss immigration diminished after  1930,  because  of  the
Great  Depression  and  World  War  II; between 1960 and 1990, more than
52,000 Swiss  re-located  to  the  United  States;  many  of  whom  were
professionals or employees in American branches of Swiss companies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Swiss-Americans  have  made  significant  contributions to
American society  as  doctors,  politicians,  musicians,  athletes,  and
teachers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Abraham  Alfonse  Albert  Gallatin  was  a  Swiss-American
politician, diplomat, ethnologist, and linguist; he  held  the  esteemed
positions of Congressman, Senator, United States Ambassador, and was the
longest-serving  United  States  Secretary  of the Treasury; in 1831, he
founded the University of the City of New York, now known  as  New  York
University; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Swiss-born  American  naturalist,  geologist, and teacher,
Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz  made  revolutionary  contributions  to  the
study  of  natural  science  with  landmark work on glacier activity and
extinct fishes; he achieved lasting fame through his innovative teaching
methods, which altered the character of natural science education in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  world  renowned  Swiss-American  chef,  Dolph  Zueger,
currently resides in Warwick in Orange County, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Swiss-American Heritage Month is a time  to  celebrate  the
aspirations  and  values that have been shared with the Swiss people for
generations, and to recognize the countless contributions  of  Americans
and  New  Yorkers  of  Swiss  descent  to  every aspect of society; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  2023,  as
Swiss-American Heritage Month in the  State  of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
