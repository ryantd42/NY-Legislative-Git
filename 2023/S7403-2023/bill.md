 from the date of mailing of a notice of a proceeding in which to  answer
 or reply;
  §  4.  Paragraph (j) of subdivision 1 of section 8-a of chapter 274 of
 the laws of 1946, constituting the emergency housing rent  control  law,
 as  added  by  section 7 of part K of chapter 36 of the laws of 2019, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (j) provide, that where an application for a major capital improvement
 rent increase has been filed, a tenant shall have  [sixty]  NINETY  days
 from  the date of mailing of a notice of a proceeding in which to answer

  § 5. Paragraph 6 of subdivision c of section 26-511 of the administra-
 tive code of the city of New York, as separately amended by  section  12
 of  part  K  of chapter 36 and section 28 of part Q of chapter 39 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (6) provides criteria whereby the commissioner may act  upon  applica-
 tions  by  owners  for  increases  in  excess  of the level of fair rent
 increase established under this law provided, however, that such  crite-
 ria  shall  provide  (a) as to hardship applications, for a finding that
 the level of fair rent increase is not sufficient to enable the owner to
 maintain approximately the same average annual net income  (which  shall
 be  computed  without regard to debt service, financing costs or manage-
 ment fees) for the three year period ending on or within six  months  of
 the  date  of  an application pursuant to such criteria as compared with
 annual net income, which prevailed on the average over the period  nine-
 teen  hundred  sixty-eight  through nineteen hundred seventy, or for the
 first three years of operation if the building was completed since nine-
 teen hundred sixty-eight or for the first three  fiscal  years  after  a
 transfer of title to a new owner provided the new owner can establish to
 the  satisfaction  of  the commissioner that he or she acquired title to
 the building as a result of a bona fide sale of the entire building  and
 that  the new owner is unable to obtain requisite records for the fiscal
 years nineteen hundred  sixty-eight  through  nineteen  hundred  seventy
 despite  diligent  efforts to obtain same from predecessors in title and
 further provided that the new owner can provide financial data  covering
 a  minimum  of  six  years under his or her continuous and uninterrupted
 operation of the building to meet the three year to three  year  compar-
 ative  test  periods  herein provided; and (b) as to completed building-
 wide major capital improvements, for a finding  that  such  improvements
 are deemed depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and that the cost
 is  to  be amortized over a twelve-year period for a building with thir-
 ty-five or fewer housing accommodations, or a twelve  and  one-half-year
 period for a building with more than thirty-five housing accommodations,
 for  any  determination  issued by the division of housing and community
 renewal after the effective date of the [the] chapter of the laws of two
 thousand nineteen that amended this paragraph and shall be removed  from
 the  legal regulated rent thirty years from the date the increase became
 effective inclusive of any increases  granted  by  the  applicable  rent
 guidelines board. Temporary major capital improvement increases shall be
 collectible  prospectively on the first day of the first month beginning
 sixty days from the date of mailing notice of approval  to  the  tenant.
 Such  notice  shall  disclose the total monthly increase in rent and the
 first month in which the tenant would be required to pay  the  temporary
 increase. An approval for a temporary major capital improvement increase
 shall  not  include retroactive payments. The collection of any increase
 shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of  the
 order  granting  the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of
 S. 7403  3
 
 gross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum  to
 be  spread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as estab-
 lished or set in future years.  Upon vacancy, the landlord may  add  any
 remaining balance of the temporary major capital improvement increase to
 the  legal  regulated  rent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
 law, for any renewal lease commencing on or after  June  14,  2019,  the
 collection  of  any rent increases due to any major capital improvements
 approved on or after June 16, 2012 and before June 16,  2019  shall  not
 exceed  two  percent in any year for any tenant in occupancy on the date
 the major capital improvement was approved or based upon  cash  purchase
 price exclusive of interest or service charges. Where an application for
 a  temporary major capital improvement increase has been filed, a tenant
 shall have [sixty] NINETY days from the date of mailing of a notice of a
 proceeding in which to answer or reply. The state  division  of  housing
 and  community  renewal  shall  provide  any  responding tenant with the
 reasons for the division's approval or denial of such application.  THE
 DIVISION  OF  HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL REQUIRE THE SUBMISSION
 OF COPIES OF ALL PERMITS PERTAINING TO MAJOR  CAPITAL  IMPROVEMENT  WORK
 WITH  ANY APPLICATION FOR A MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RENT INCREASE. ANY
 APPLICATION  SUBMITTED  WITH  FRAUDULENT  PERMITS  OR  WITHOUT  REQUIRED
 PERMITS  SHALL  BE  DENIED.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the contrary
 contained herein, no hardship increase granted pursuant  to  this  para-
 graph  shall, when added to the annual gross rents, as determined by the
 commissioner, exceed the sum of, (i) the annual operating expenses, (ii)
 an allowance for management services as determined by the  commissioner,
 (iii) actual annual mortgage debt service (interest and amortization) on
 its  indebtedness  to  a  lending  institution,  an insurance company, a
 retirement fund or welfare fund which is operated under the  supervision
 of  the banking or insurance laws of the state of New York or the United
 States, and (iv) eight and one-half percent of that portion of the  fair
 market  value  of the property which exceeds the unpaid principal amount
 of the mortgage indebtedness referred to in subparagraph (iii)  of  this
 paragraph. Fair market value for the purposes of this paragraph shall be
 six  times  the annual gross rent. The collection of any increase in the
 stabilized rent for any apartment pursuant to this paragraph  shall  not
 exceed  six  percent  in  any  year from the effective date of the order
 granting the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule  of  gross
 rents,  with  collectability  of  any dollar excess above said sum to be
 spread forward in similar increments and added to the stabilized rent as
 established or set in future years;

 ter  576  of  the  laws  of  1974,  constituting  the  emergency  tenant
 protection act of  nineteen seventy-four, as added by section 13 of part

 reply. The state division of housing and community renewal shall provide
