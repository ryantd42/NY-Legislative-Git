 GIFT  CERTIFICATES;  (II)  THE  TERM "ELECTRONIC GIFT CARD" OR "MAGNETIC

 FOR  GOODS  OR SERVICES WHEREBY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE CARD IS REDUCED
 ACCORDINGLY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first day of a quarterly  sales
 tax  period,  as set forth in subdivision (b) of section 1136 of the tax
 law, next succeeding the thirtieth day after it shall have become a law.
 Provided, however that the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  shall
 take  any  action necessary for the timely implementation of this act on
 or before the date on which it shall have become a law.
