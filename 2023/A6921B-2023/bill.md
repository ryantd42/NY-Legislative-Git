 sooner  than  four months and not later than six months from the date of
 submission of such filing. The attorney general may also refuse to issue
 a letter stating that the offering statement or statements or prospectus
 has been filed whenever it appears that the offering statement or state-
 ments or prospectus does not clearly set forth the specific property  or

 acquired, financed or the subject of specific investment with a substan-
 tial portion of the offering proceeds.
