 law,  which  permits  the applicant to solicit public interest or public
 funds preliminary to the filing of an  offering  statement  or  for  the
 issuance of a "no-filing required" letter AND ANY AMENDMENT THERETO, the
 department  of  law  shall collect a fee of [two] SEVEN hundred [twenty-
 five] FIFTY dollars. [In the  event  the  sponsor  thereafter  files  an
 offering  statement,  the fee paid for the preliminary application shall
 be credited against the balance of the fee due and payable  on  filing.]
 For  each  application  granted pursuant to section three hundred fifty-
 two-g of this article, the department of law  shall  collect  a  fee  of
 two-tenths  of  one percent of the amount of the offering of securities;
 however, the minimum fee shall be seven hundred fifty dollars,  and  the
 maximum  fee  shall be [thirty] FIFTY thousand dollars. All revenue from
 that portion of any  fee  imposed  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  which
 exceeds  twenty  thousand  dollars  FOR  OFFERING  STATEMENTS,  AND FIVE

 sion, the department of law shall not collect any fees for the filing of
 an offering statement or prospectus or any amended  filings  thereto  as
 described  in subdivision one of this section whenever: (I) a conversion
 of a mobile home park, building or group  of  buildings  or  development
 from  residential  rental status to cooperative or condominium ownership
