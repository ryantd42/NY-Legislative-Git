BY: M. of A. Paulin
 
  MOURNING the death of Joan Pantanelli, meritorious
  veteran,  distinguished  citizen, and devoted member
  of her community
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality of life in our community and have had a measurable positive
impact on the lives of its  residents;  Joan  Pantanelli  was  one  such
individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  profound  sorrow  and  deep regret that this
Legislative Body records the passing  of  Joan  Pantanelli,  noting  the
significance of her purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Joan "Johnnie" Pantanelli, of White Plains, New York, died
on Saturday, January 14, 2023, at the age of 97; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on March 1, 1925, Joan Adkins grew  up  in  Scarsdale,
New  York,  where she graduated from high school in 1943; she went on to
study aeronautical engineering at  New  York  University  (NYU),  before
briefly  working  for  General Electric manufacturing BA-10 motors which
operated bomb-bay doors on bombers for the war; and
 
  WHEREAS, From a young age, Joan Adkins had a  love  for  motorcycles
and  airplanes;  she was a member of the Motor Maids of America, and met
her future husband at the motorcycle shop in White Plains, where he  was
a mechanic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1944,  with  World  War  II in full swing, Joan Adkins
joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves  and  Civil  Air  Patrol,
where  she  helped  with  reconnaissance  missions, searching for German
submarines  off  the  East  Coast;  this  earned  her  the  prestigious
Congressional Gold Medal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the  completion of her military service, Joan Adkins
spent her weekdays working at the Warwick Country  Club;  determined  to
fly  airplanes,  she  used her wages and tips to rent an airplane on the
weekends so she could learn to fly; she received her pilot's license  in
1947; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  former Joan Adkins and John Pantanelli were united in
marriage on June 7, 1952, during which time the couple  moved  to  White
Plains, New York, before welcoming their son, John-Pierre Pantanelli, in
1956; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Joan  Pantanelli  and her husband owned a motorcycle shop,
which they eventually closed to open their  scaffolding  company,  Swing
Staging  Inc.,  in New York City; after her husband passed away in 1987,
Johnnie's son took over management, and the two of them worked  together
to run the company for more than 40 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Well into her 80s and 90s, Joan Pantanelli made the commute
to  the  city  to  work  alongside  her  son;  early on, her no-nonsense
 
attitude earned her the job of making  collection  calls,  but  she  was
later  known  for  making  sure the office supplies were ordered and the
candy dish was always full; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, under her able leadership, Swing Staging grew
to become  one  of  the  largest  privately-owned  suspended-scaffolding
companies in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Outside  of work, Joan Pantanelli maintained an unwavering
commitment to  Civil  Air  Patrol  (CAP)  and  the  Northeast  Composite
Squadron,  where  she  most cherished working with the cadets; as one of
its longest serving members, the squadron she commanded was renamed  the
Colonel  Johnnie  Pantanelli Composite Squadron and she earned the grade
of Colonel in May of 2011; she faithfully attended weekly meetings until
November 11, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to being presented the Congressional Gold Medal
during the 2015 New York Wing Conference, this extraordinarily  selfless
woman  was  awarded  CAP's  Bronze  Medal of Valor in recognition of her
heroic efforts after she pulled an unconscious man from a  burning  car,
saving his life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  guitarist  and singer, Joan Pantanelli was never one to
shy away from a microphone; as a devout Catholic, she sang  baritone  in
the  Church choir for over 50 years at Our Lady of Sorrows Church, where
she was also a member of the Ladies Guild which  focused  on  charitable
community outreach; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Joan  Pantanelli's  son and grandchildren knew her for her
generosity, incredibly sharp mind, matter-of-fact persona, and  love  of
family gatherings around the holidays; she loved to sing "Be Not Afraid"
and  "Amazing Grace" with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren; she
banged pots and pans on her front porch to ring in  the  New  Year,  and
loved to toast with a glass of Reisling, on ice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Predeceased  by  her  husband,  John  Pantanelli;  mother,
Augustine Theall; father, George Adkins Sr.; brother, George Adkins; and
adoptive father, Walter Theall;  Joan  Pantanelli  is  survived  by  her
half-sister,  Patricia  Theall; son, John-Pierre Pantanelli (Sonya); and
her four grandchildren Seth, Michaelangelo and Rafaello Pantanelli,  and
Lia  Barberis;  as  well  as  four  great grandchildren, Amelia and Gwen
Pantanelli, and Ariana and Preston Barberis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joan Pantanelli's  infinite  selflessness  and  benevolence
will shine on through her family's vivid and happy memories; her insight
and  strength  will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope to
the countless lives she touched; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Joan  Pantanelli  leaves  behind  a  legacy which will long
endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
who were privileged to have known and loved such an amazing  woman;  she
will  be  deeply  missed  and  truly merits the grateful tribute of this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn  the  death  of  Joan  Pantanelli,  and  to  express  its  deepest
condolences to her family; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Joan Pantanelli.
