 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  registration as a redemption center and the handling fee paid  to  any
  dealer or operator of a redemption center
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 6  of  section  27-1007  of  the  environmental
 conservation  law, as added by section 4 of part SS of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  6. In addition to the refund value of a beverage container  as  estab-
 lished  by  section 27-1005 of this title, a deposit initiator shall pay
 to any dealer or operator of a  redemption  center  a  handling  fee  of
 [three  and one-half] FIVE cents for each beverage container accepted by
 the deposit initiator from such  dealer  or  operator  of  a  redemption
 center.  Payment  of  the  handling  fee  shall be as compensation for
 collecting, sorting and  packaging  of  empty  beverage  containers  for
 transport  back to the deposit initiator or its designee. Payment of the
 handling fee may not be conditioned on the  purchase  of  any  goods  or
 services,  nor  may such payment be made out of the refund value account
 established pursuant to section 27-1012 of this title. A distributor who
 does not initiate deposits on a type of beverage container is considered
 a dealer only for the purpose of receiving a handling fee from a deposit
 initiator.
  § 2. Paragraphs a and c of subdivision 4 of  section  27-1012  of  the
 environmental  conservation  law,  as  added  by section 8 of part SS of
 chapter 59 of the laws of 2009, are amended to read as follows:
  a. Quarterly payments. An amount equal to [eighty] FORTY-SEVEN percent
 of the balance outstanding in the refund value account at the  close  of
 each  quarter  shall be paid to the commissioner of taxation and finance

 at the time the report provided for in subdivision three of this section
 is required to be filed. The commissioner of taxation  and  finance  may
 require  that the payments be made electronically.  The remaining [twen-
 ty]  FIFTY-THREE percent of the balance outstanding at the close of each
 quarter shall be the monies of the deposit initiator and  may  be  with-
 drawn  from  such account by the deposit initiator. If the provisions of
 this section with respect to such account have not been  fully  complied
 with,  each  deposit  initiator  shall  pay to such commissioner at such
 time, in lieu of the amount described  in  the  preceding  sentence,  an
 amount  equal  to  the balance which would have been outstanding on such
 date had such provisions been fully complied with. The  commissioner  of
 taxation  and  finance  may  require that the payments be made electron-
 ically.
  c. Final report. A deposit initiator who ceases to do business in this
 state as a deposit initiator shall file a final report and remit payment
 of [eighty] FORTY-SEVEN percent of all amounts remaining in  the  refund
 value  account  as  of  the close of the deposit initiator's last day of
 business. The commissioner of taxation and finance may require that  the
 payments be made electronically. The deposit initiator shall indicate on
 the  report  that  it is a "final report". The final report is due to be
 filed with payment twenty days after the close of the  quarterly  period
 in  which  the deposit initiator ceases to do business. In the event the
 deposit initiator pays out more in refund values  than  it  collects  in
 such  final  quarterly  period,  the  deposit initiator may apply to the
 commissioner of taxation and finance for a refund of the amount of  such
 excess payment of refund values from sources other than the refund value
 account,  in  the manner as provided by the commissioner of taxation and
 finance.
  § 3. Section  27-1013  of  the  environmental conservation  law,  as
 amended  by  section  7  of part F of chapter 58 of the laws of 2013, is
 amended to read as follows:

  2.  The commissioner is hereby empowered to promulgate rules and regu-
 lations governing (a) the circumstances  in  which  deposit  initiators,
 dealers  and distributors, individually or collectively, are required to
 accept the return  of  empty  beverage  containers,  including  beverage
 containers  processed  through reverse vending machines and make payment
 therefor; (b) the sorting of the containers which a deposit initiator or
 distributor may require of  dealers  and  redemption  centers;  (c)  the
 collection  of  returned  beverage  containers  by deposit initiators or
 distributors, including the party to whom such expense is to be charged,
 the frequency of such pick ups and the payment for refunds and  handling
 fees  thereon;  (d) the right of dealers to restrict or limit the number
 of containers redeemed, the rules for redemption at the  dealers'  place
 of  business, and the redemption of containers from a beverage for which
 sales have been discontinued; (e) [to issue] registrations AND  RENEWALS
 ISSUED  to  persons,  firms  or  corporations which establish redemption
 centers, subject to applicable provisions of local and  state  laws,  at
 which  redeemers  and  dealers  may return empty beverage containers and
 receive payment of the refund value of such beverage  containers[.  Such
 registrations  shall be issued at no cost. Should the department require
 by regulations  adopted  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  that  redemption
 centers  must  obtain  a  registration  as a condition of operation, any
 redemption center in business as of March first, two  thousand  thirteen
 that  previously  provided the department with the notification informa-
 tion required by regulations in effect as of such date may  continue  to
 operate  as if the department had issued such redemption center a regis-
 tration required by regulations adopted under this paragraph;  provided,
 however,  that  such redemption center shall provide the department with
 any other information required by regulations adopted pursuant  to  this
 paragraph.  The  department  may,  after due notice and opportunity of
 hearing, pursuant to the provisions of section 71-1709 of this  chapter,
 deny  an application or revoke a registration. In determining whether or
 not to revoke a registration the commissioner shall at a  minimum,  take
 into  consideration  the  compliance  history  of a violator, good faith
 efforts of a violator to comply, any economic benefit from noncompliance
 and whether the violation was procedural in nature.  The  commissioner's
 determination  to revoke a registration is subject to review under arti-
 cle seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules];  and  (f)  the
 operation  of  mobile  redemption centers in order to ensure that to the
 best extent practicable containers are not proffered for redemption to a
 deposit initiator or distributor outside of the  geographic  area  where
 such deposit initiator sells containers and initiates deposits.
  [2.]  3.  The  department  may require a redemption center to obtain a
 permit, as an alternative to registration if such center is  located  at
 the  same  facility  or  site as another solid waste management facility
 otherwise subject to the requirements of title seven of this article  or
 the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
 S. 7428--A  5
 
  [3.]  4.  No  dealer  or distributor, as defined in section 27-1003 of
 this title, shall be required to obtain a permit to operate a redemption
 center at the same location as the dealer's or  distributor's  place  of
 business.  Operators of such redemption centers shall receive payment of
 the refund value of each beverage container from the appropriate deposit
 initiator  or  distributor  as  provided  under  section 27-1007 of this
 title.
  [4.] 5. Each dealer and redemption center  shall  require  any  person
 tendering  for redemption more than two thousand five hundred containers
 at one time to such dealer or redemption center to provide such person's
 name and address and the license plate of the vehicle used to  transport
 the  containers,  or,  in the case of an agent or employee of a not-for-
 profit corporation, a sales tax exemption  certificate.  The  dealer  or
 redemption  center  redeeming  the  beverage  containers  shall keep the
 information on file for a minimum of twelve months and provide  same  to
 the department upon request.
  §  4.  Subdivisions 2, 3 and 4 of section 27-1015 of the environmental
 conservation law, as amended by section 8 of part F of chapter 58 of the

  3. It shall be unlawful  for  a  distributor,  or  deposit  initiator,
 REDEMPTION CENTER OR DEALER, acting alone or aided by another, to return

 refund value if the distributor, or deposit initiator, REDEMPTION CENTER
 OR DEALER RETURNING THE EMPTY BEVERAGE CONTAINER had KNOWINGLY previous-
 ly accepted such beverage container from any dealer  or  operator  of  a
 redemption  center  or if THE DISTRIBUTOR, DEPOSIT INITIATOR, REDEMPTION
 CENTER OR DEALER RETURNING THE EMPTY BEVERAGE CONTAINER KNOWS THAT  such
 container  was  previously  accepted  by  a  reverse  vending machine. A
 violation of this subdivision shall be a  misdemeanor  punishable  by  a
 fine  of  not  less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand
 dollars and an amount equal to two times the amount of money received as
 a result of such violation. A DISTRIBUTOR, DEPOSIT INITIATOR, REDEMPTION

 SIONER  OF  TAXATION  AND  FINANCE.  ANY CIVIL PENALTY MAY BE ASSESSED

 SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION MAY RESULT IN A CIVIL PENALTY OF UP
 TO  FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.  ANY CIVIL PENALTY MAY BE ASSESSED FOLLOWING
 A HEARING OR OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. At each location  where  a  person
 tenders  containers  for redemption, dealers and redemption centers must
 conspicuously display a sign in letters that are at least  one  inch  in

  4-B. (A) A DEPOSIT INITIATOR WHICH UPON AUDIT DISCOVERS THAT A REDEMP-
 TION CENTER REPORTED MORE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAN WERE  ACTUALLY  PHYS-
 ICALLY TENDERED SHALL PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE REDEMPTION CENTER OF
 SUCH  SHORTFALL  AND SHALL PROVIDE A REFUND BASED ON THE ACTUAL TENDERED
 AMOUNT, PROVIDED THAT IF SUCH AUDIT REVEALS A  DISCREPANCY  BETWEEN  THE
 REDEMPTION CENTER'S REPORTED NUMBER OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND THE ACTU-
 AL  PHYSICAL  COUNT OF TEN PERCENT OR GREATER, THE DEPOSIT INITIATOR MAY
 WITHHOLD UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HANDLING FEE  OTHERWISE  PAYABLE  TO
 THE  REDEMPTION  CENTER  FOR SUCH TENDER, AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT UPON
 ANY SUBSEQUENT AUDIT WHICH PRODUCES A  DISCREPANCY  OF  TEN  PERCENT  OR

 ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY TENDERED SHALL PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE DEPOSIT
 INITIATOR  OF  SUCH SHORTFALL AND SHALL RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM THE DEPOSIT
 INITIATOR BASED ON THE ACTUAL TENDERED AMOUNT,  PROVIDED  THAT  IF  SUCH
 AUDIT  REVEALS  A  DISCREPANCY  BETWEEN THE DEPOSIT INITIATOR'S REPORTED
 NUMBER OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND  THE  ACTUAL  PHYSICAL  COUNT  OF  TEN
 PERCENT  OR  GREATER,  THE  REDEMPTION  CENTER SHALL BE PAID ONE HUNDRED
 FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HANDLING FEE OTHERWISE PAYABLE  TO  THE  REDEMPTION
 CENTER  FOR  SUCH  TENDER, AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT UPON ANY SUBSEQUENT
 AUDIT WHICH PRODUCES A DISCREPANCY OF TEN PERCENT OR MORE,  THE  REDEMP-
 TION CENTER SHALL BE PAID TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE HANDLING FEE OTHER-
 WISE PAYABLE TO SUCH REDEMPTION CENTER.
  §  5.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
