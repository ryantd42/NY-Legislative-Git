 Introduced  by M. of A. PAULIN, CONRAD, ZEBROWSKI, FAHY -- read once and
  referred to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  establishing  the
  "donor-conceived person protection act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "donor-conceived person protection act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and intent.  The legislature acknowledges
 the importance  of  parents  and  donor-conceived  persons  knowing  the
 medical history of individuals who have donated reproductive tissue to a
 reproductive  tissue  bank for purposes of an artificial insemination or
 assisted reproductive technology procedure and disseminating this histo-
 ry information to a recipient and donor-conceived person  upon  request,
 if any.
  The  legislature further acknowledges knowing the medical history of a
 donor will provide recipients with the  necessary  information  to  make
 informed  decisions  regarding the process of artificial insemination or
 assisted  reproductive  technology  procedure  and  for  donor-conceived
 persons  to  obtain  essential medical information, which may reveal any
 genetic or mental health disorders.
  The legislature finds that reproductive tissue banks, including  semen
 banks,  oocyte donation programs and embryo banks have a duty to collect
 and verify medical history information provided by donors on donor self-
 reported medical histories and during the donor screening processes  and
 to  keep  detailed  records of such for use by recipients and donor-con-
 ceived persons, if any, prior to a procedure and in the future.
  § 3. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  4369-a
 to read as follows:
  §  4369-A.  DONOR-CONCEIVED PERSON PROTECTION ACT. 1. FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
