 AN  ACT  to amend the public health law, in relation to establishing the
  "donor-conceived person protection act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "donor-conceived person protection act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent.  The  legislature  acknowledges
 the  importance  of  parents  and  donor-conceived  persons  knowing the
 medical history of individuals who have donated reproductive tissue to a
 reproductive tissue bank for purposes of an artificial  insemination  or
 assisted reproductive technology procedure and disseminating this histo-
 ry  information  to a recipient and donor-conceived person upon request,
 if any.
  The legislature further acknowledges knowing the medical history of  a
 donor  will  provide  recipients  with the necessary information to make
 informed decisions regarding the process of artificial  insemination  or
 assisted  reproductive  technology  procedure  and  for  donor-conceived
 persons to obtain essential medical information, which  may  reveal  any
 relevant inheritable conditions.
  The  legislature  finds  that reproductive tissue banks have a duty to
 collect and verify medical history information  provided  by  donors  on
 donor  self-reported  medical  histories  and during the donor screening
 processes and to keep detailed records of such for use by recipients and
 donor-conceived persons, if any, prior to a procedure and in the future.
  § 3. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  4369-a
 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
