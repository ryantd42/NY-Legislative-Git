 AN  ACT to amend the domestic relations law and the family court act, in
  relation to establishing "Kyra's Law"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 "Kyra's Law".
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 240 of the  domestic  relations  law  is
 amended by adding a new opening paragraph to read as follows:
  THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THAT THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IS OF PARAMOUNT
 IMPORTANCE  AND  IS AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF THEIR BEST INTERESTS. TO THAT
 END, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS REGARDING CUSTODY OF,
 AND ACCESS TO, CHILDREN MUST ENSURE CHILDREN'S  SAFETY  AS  A  THRESHOLD
 ISSUE.
  §  3.  Paragraphs (a) and (a-1) of subdivision 1 of section 240 of the
 domestic relations law, paragraph (a) as amended by chapter 567  of  the
 laws  of 2015 and paragraph (a-1) as added by chapter 295 of the laws of
 2009, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) In any action or proceeding brought (1) to annul a marriage or  to
 declare  the nullity of a void marriage, or (2) for a separation, or (3)

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 for a divorce, or (4) to obtain, by a writ of habeas corpus or by  peti-
 tion and order to show cause, the custody of or right to visitation with
 any  child  of  a  marriage, the court shall require verification of the
 status of any child of the marriage with respect to such child's custody
 and  support,  including  any  prior  orders, and shall enter orders for
 custody and support as, in the  court's  discretion,  justice  requires,
 having  regard  to  the  circumstances of the case and of the respective
 parties and to the best interests  of  the  child  and  subject  to  the
 provisions of subdivision one-c of this section.  WHEN THE PARTIES FIRST
 APPEAR IN COURT, THE COURT SHALL ADVISE THE PARTIES BEFORE PROCEEDING OF
 THE  RIGHT  TO  BE  REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING, OF THE
 RIGHT TO HAVE AN ADJOURNMENT OF NO LONGER THAN FOURTEEN  COURT  DAYS  TO
 CONFER  WITH COUNSEL, AND THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES,
 PURSUANT TO SECTION TWO  HUNDRED  THIRTY-SEVEN  OF  THIS  ARTICLE.  WHEN
 APPROPRIATE,  THE COURT SHALL ASSIGN COUNSEL TO THE PARTIES, PURSUANT TO
 ARTICLE TWO OF THE FAMILY COURT ACT. Where either  party  to  an  action
 concerning custody of or a right to visitation with a child alleges in a
 sworn  petition  or  complaint or sworn answer, cross-petition, counter-
 claim or other sworn  responsive  pleading  that  the  other  party  has
 committed an act of domestic violence against the party making the alle-
 gation  or  a family or household member of either party, as such family
 or household member is defined in article eight of the family court act,
 and such allegations are proven by a preponderance of the evidence,  the
 court  must  consider the effect of such domestic violence upon the best
 interests of the child, together with such other facts and circumstances
 as the court deems relevant in  making  a  direction  pursuant  to  this
 section  and  state  on  the record how such findings, facts and circum-
 stances factored into the direction. If a  parent  makes  a  good  faith
 allegation  based  on  a  reasonable  belief supported by facts that the
 child is the victim of child abuse, child neglect,  or  the  effects  of
 domestic violence, and if that parent acts lawfully and in good faith in
 response  to  that reasonable belief to protect the child or seek treat-
 ment for the child, then that parent shall not be deprived  of  custody,
 visitation  or contact with the child, or restricted in custody, visita-
 tion or contact, based solely on that belief or the  reasonable  actions
 taken  based  on that belief. If an allegation that a child is abused is
 supported by a preponderance of  the  evidence,  then  the  court  shall
 consider  such  evidence of abuse in determining the visitation arrange-
 ment that is in the best interest of the child, and the court shall  not
 place a child in the custody of a parent who presents a substantial risk
 of  harm  to that child, and shall state on the record how such findings
 were factored into the determination. Where a proceeding filed  pursuant
 to  article  ten or ten-A of the family court act is pending at the same
 time as a proceeding brought in the supreme court involving the  custody
 of,  or  right  to  visitation  with, any child of a marriage, the court
 presiding over the proceeding under article ten or ten-A of  the  family
 court  act  may  jointly  hear the dispositional hearing on the petition
 under article ten or the permanency hearing under article ten-A  of  the
 family  court act and, upon referral from the supreme court, the hearing
 to resolve the matter of custody or visitation in the proceeding pending
 in the supreme court; provided however, the court must determine custody
 or visitation in accordance with the terms of this section.
  An order directing the payment of  child  support  shall  contain  the
 social  security  numbers of the named parties. In all cases there shall
 be no prima facie right to the custody of the child  in  either  parent.
 Such direction shall make provision for child support out of the proper-
 A. 3346--A  3
 
 ty  of  either or both parents. The court shall make its award for child
 support pursuant to subdivision one-b of this  section.  Such  direction
 may  provide  for  reasonable  visitation  rights to the maternal and/or
 paternal  grandparents of any child of the parties. Such direction as it
 applies to rights of visitation with a child remanded or placed  in  the
 care  of  a  person, official, agency or institution pursuant to article
 ten of the family court act, or pursuant to an instrument approved under
 section three hundred fifty-eight-a of the social services law, shall be
 enforceable pursuant to part eight of article ten of  the  family  court
 act  and  sections three hundred fifty-eight-a and three hundred eighty-
 four-a of the social services law and other applicable provisions of law
 against any person having care and custody, or temporary care and custo-
 dy, of the child. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any  writ-
 ten  application or motion to the court for the establishment, modifica-
 tion or enforcement of a child support obligation  for  persons  not  in
 receipt  of public assistance and care must contain either a request for
 child support enforcement services which would authorize the  collection
 of  the  support  obligation  by  the  immediate  issuance  of an income
 execution for support enforcement  as  provided  for  by  this  chapter,
 completed in the manner specified in section one hundred eleven-g of the
 social  services  law; or a statement that the applicant has applied for
 or is in receipt of such services; or a  statement  that  the  applicant
 knows  of  the  availability of such services, has declined them at this
 time and where support enforcement  services  pursuant  to  section  one
 hundred  eleven-g of the social services law have been declined that the
 applicant understands that an  income  deduction  order  may  be  issued
 pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of section fifty-two hundred forty-two of
 the civil practice law and rules without other child support enforcement
 services and that payment of an administrative fee may be required.  The
 court  shall  provide  a  copy  of  any  such  request for child support
 enforcement services to the support collection unit of  the  appropriate
 social services district any time it directs payments to be made to such
 support  collection  unit.  Additionally,  the  copy of any such request
 shall be accompanied by the name, address and social security number  of
 the  parties;  the date and place of the parties' marriage; the name and
 date of birth of the child or children; and the name and address of  the
 employers  and  income  payors  of  the party from whom child support is
 sought or from the party ordered to  pay  child  support  to  the  other
 party.  Such direction may require the payment of a sum or sums of money
 either directly to the custodial parent or to third persons for goods or
 services furnished for such child, or for both payments to the custodial
 parent and to such third persons; provided,  however,  that  unless  the
 party seeking or receiving child support has applied for or is receiving
 such  services,  the  court shall not direct such payments to be made to
 the support collection unit,  as  established  in  section  one  hundred
 eleven-h  of  the social services law. Every order directing the payment
 of support shall require that if either parent currently, or at any time
 in the future, has health  insurance  benefits  available  that  may  be
 extended  or  obtained  to  cover  the child, such parent is required to
 exercise the option of additional coverage in favor of  such  child  and
 execute  and  deliver  to  such  person any forms, notices, documents or
 instruments necessary to assure timely payment of any  health  insurance
 claims for such child.
  (a-1)(1)  Permanent and initial temporary orders of custody or visita-
 tion. Prior to the issuance of any permanent or initial temporary  order
 of  custody or visitation, the court shall conduct a review of ANY FIND-

 the  decisions  and  reports  listed in subparagraph three of this para-
 graph, unless such a review has been conducted within ninety days  prior

 cle ten of the family court act, and all warrants issued under the fami-
 ly court act; [and]
