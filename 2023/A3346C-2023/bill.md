 A. 3346--B  2
 
  §  3.  Paragraphs (a) and (a-1) of subdivision 1 of section 240 of the
 domestic relations law, paragraph (a) as amended by chapter 567  of  the
 laws  of  2015 and paragraph (a-1) as amended by chapter 295 of the laws
 of 2009, are amended to read as follows:
  (a)  In any action or proceeding brought (1) to annul a marriage or to
 declare the nullity of a void marriage, or (2) for a separation, or  (3)
 for  a divorce, or (4) to obtain, by a writ of habeas corpus or by peti-
 tion and order to show cause, the custody of or right to visitation with
 any child of a marriage, the court shall  require  verification  of  the
 status of any child of the marriage with respect to such child's custody
 and  support,  including  any  prior  orders, and shall enter orders for
 custody and support as, in the  court's  discretion,  justice  requires,
 having  regard  to  the  circumstances of the case and of the respective
 parties and to the best interests  of  the  child  and  subject  to  the
 provisions of subdivision one-c of this section.  WHEN THE PARTIES FIRST
 APPEAR IN COURT, THE COURT SHALL ADVISE THE PARTIES BEFORE PROCEEDING OF
 THE  RIGHT  TO  BE  REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING, OF THE
 RIGHT TO HAVE AN ADJOURNMENT OF NO LONGER THAN FOURTEEN  COURT  DAYS  TO
 CONFER  WITH COUNSEL, AND THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES,
 PURSUANT TO SECTION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE. THE  COURT
 SHALL  ASSIGN  COUNSEL  TO THE PARTIES AND CHILDREN, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE
 TWO OF THE FAMILY COURT ACT. Where either party to an action  concerning
 custody  of  or  a  right  to visitation with a child alleges in a sworn
 petition or complaint or sworn answer, cross-petition,  counterclaim  or
 other  sworn  responsive  pleading that the other party has committed an
 act of domestic violence against the party making the  allegation  or  a
 family  or household member of either party, as such family or household
 member is defined in article eight of the family  court  act,  and  such
 allegations  are  proven  by  a preponderance of the evidence, the court
 must consider the effect of such domestic violence upon the best  inter-
 ests  of  the child, together with such other facts and circumstances as
 the court deems relevant in making a direction pursuant to this  section
 and  state  on  the  record  how  such findings, facts and circumstances
 factored into the direction. If a parent makes a good  faith  allegation
 based  on  a  reasonable belief supported by facts that the child is the
 victim of child  abuse,  child  neglect,  or  the  effects  of  domestic
 violence, and if that parent acts lawfully and in good faith in response
 to that reasonable belief to protect the child or seek treatment for the
 child,  then that parent shall not be deprived of custody, visitation or
 contact with the child, or restricted in custody, visitation or contact,
 based solely on that belief or the reasonable  actions  taken  based  on
 that  belief.  If an allegation that a child is abused is supported by a
 preponderance of the  evidence,  then  the  court  shall  consider  such
 evidence  of  abuse in determining the visitation arrangement that is in
 the best interest of the child, and the court shall not place a child in
 the custody of a parent who presents a substantial risk of harm to  that
 child,  and  shall  state  on the record how such findings were factored
 into the determination. Where a proceeding filed pursuant to article ten
 or ten-A of the family court act is  pending  at  the  same  time  as  a
 proceeding  brought  in  the  supreme court involving the custody of, or
 right to visitation with, any child of a marriage, the  court  presiding
 over  the  proceeding under article ten or ten-A of the family court act
 may jointly hear the dispositional hearing on the petition under article
 ten or the permanency hearing under article ten-A of  the  family  court
 act  and,  upon  referral from the supreme court, the hearing to resolve
 the matter of custody or visitation in the  proceeding  pending  in  the
 A. 3346--B  3
 
 supreme  court;  provided  however,  the court must determine custody or
 visitation in accordance with the terms of this section.
  An  order  directing  the  payment  of child support shall contain the
 social security numbers of the named parties. In all cases  there  shall
 be  no  prima  facie right to the custody of the child in either parent.
 Such direction shall make provision for child support out of the proper-
 ty of either or both parents. The court shall make its award  for  child
 support  pursuant  to  subdivision one-b of this section. Such direction
 may provide for reasonable visitation  rights  to  the  maternal  and/or
 paternal  grandparents of any child of the parties. Such direction as it
 applies to rights of visitation with a child remanded or placed  in  the
 care  of  a  person, official, agency or institution pursuant to article
 ten of the family court act, or pursuant to an instrument approved under
 section three hundred fifty-eight-a of the social services law, shall be
 enforceable pursuant to part eight of article ten of  the  family  court
 act  and  sections three hundred fifty-eight-a and three hundred eighty-
 four-a of the social services law and other applicable provisions of law
 against any person having care and custody, or temporary care and custo-
 dy, of the child. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any  writ-
 ten  application or motion to the court for the establishment, modifica-
 tion or enforcement of a child support obligation  for  persons  not  in
 receipt  of public assistance and care must contain either a request for
 child support enforcement services which would authorize the  collection
 of  the  support  obligation  by  the  immediate  issuance  of an income
 execution for support enforcement  as  provided  for  by  this  chapter,
 completed in the manner specified in section one hundred eleven-g of the
 social  services  law; or a statement that the applicant has applied for
 or is in receipt of such services; or a  statement  that  the  applicant
 knows  of  the  availability of such services, has declined them at this
 time and where support enforcement  services  pursuant  to  section  one
 hundred  eleven-g of the social services law have been declined that the
 applicant understands that an  income  deduction  order  may  be  issued
 pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of section fifty-two hundred forty-two of
 the civil practice law and rules without other child support enforcement
 services and that payment of an administrative fee may be required.  The
 court  shall  provide  a  copy  of  any  such  request for child support
 enforcement services to the support collection unit of  the  appropriate
 social services district any time it directs payments to be made to such
 support  collection  unit.  Additionally,  the  copy of any such request
 shall be accompanied by the name, address and social security number  of
 the  parties;  the date and place of the parties' marriage; the name and
 date of birth of the child or children; and the name and address of  the
 employers  and  income  payors  of  the party from whom child support is
 sought or from the party ordered to  pay  child  support  to  the  other
 party.  Such direction may require the payment of a sum or sums of money
 either directly to the custodial parent or to third persons for goods or
 services furnished for such child, or for both payments to the custodial
 parent and to such third persons; provided,  however,  that  unless  the
 party seeking or receiving child support has applied for or is receiving
 such  services,  the  court shall not direct such payments to be made to
 the support collection unit,  as  established  in  section  one  hundred
 eleven-h  of  the social services law. Every order directing the payment
 of support shall require that if either parent currently, or at any time
 in the future, has health  insurance  benefits  available  that  may  be
 extended  or  obtained  to  cover  the child, such parent is required to
 exercise the option of additional coverage in favor of  such  child  and
 A. 3346--B  4

 execute  and  deliver  to  such  person any forms, notices, documents or
 instruments necessary to assure timely payment of any  health  insurance
 claims for such child.
  (a-1)(1) [Permanent and initial temporary orders of custody or visita-
 tion.  Prior to the issuance of any permanent or initial temporary order
 of custody or visitation, the court shall conduct a review of the  deci-
 sions and reports listed in subparagraph three of this paragraph.
  (2) Successive temporary orders of custody or visitation. Prior to the
 issuance of any successive temporary order of custody or visitation, the
 court  shall  conduct  a  review  of the decisions and reports listed in
 subparagraph three of this paragraph, unless  such  a  review  has  been
 conducted within ninety days prior to the issuance of such order.
  (3)  Decisions  and  reports  for  review.  The  court shall conduct a

 ATTORNEY FOR THE CHILD, CREDIBLY  ALLEGING  THAT  THE  OTHER  PARTY  HAS
 COMMITTED,  HAS  THREATENED  TO COMMIT, OR IS LIKELY TO COMMIT AN ACT OF
 CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT AGAINST SUCH CHILD, OR HAS COMMITTED, HAS THREAT-
 ENED TO COMMIT, OR IS LIKELY TO COMMIT  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  AGAINST  THE
 PARTY  MAKING  THE  ALLEGATION OR A FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD MEMBER OF EITHER
 PARTY, AND THAT ALLEGATION, IF TRUE, WOULD POSE A SERIOUS  RISK  TO  THE
 SAFETY  OF  THE CHILD, THE COURT SHALL HOLD A PROMPT EVIDENTIARY HEARING
 TO DETERMINE WHETHER TEMPORARY LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON THE  CUSTODY
 OR  VISITATION  RIGHTS  OF THE PARTY WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED AN
 ACT OF CHILD ABUSE AGAINST THE CHILD, OR COMMITTED AN  ACT  OF  DOMESTIC

 CHILD'S SAFETY. EXCEPT FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN, THE HEARING FOR SUCH DETER-
 MINATION  SHALL COMMENCE WITHIN TWENTY COURT DAYS OF THE APPLICATION FOR
 SUCH HEARING. PARTIES SHALL BE NOTIFIED OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE ASSISTANCE
 OF COUNSEL AT THE INITIATION OF SUCH HEARING. DURING SUCH HEARING,  ONLY
