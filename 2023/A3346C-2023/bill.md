 eof,  the  court,  on due consideration, may award the natural guardian-
 ship, charge and custody of such child to either parent for  such  time,

 right to the custody of the child in either parent, but the court  shall

 will best promote its welfare and happiness, and make award accordingly.

 VISITATION  WITH  A  CHILD ALLEGES THAT THE OTHER PARTY HAS COMMITTED AN
 ACT OF CHILD ABUSE AGAINST SUCH CHILD, OR COMMITTED AN ACT  OF  DOMESTIC
 VIOLENCE  AGAINST  THE PARTY MAKING THE ALLEGATION OR A FAMILY OR HOUSE-
 HOLD MEMBER OF EITHER PARTY, AS SUCH FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD IS  DEFINED  IN

 HUNDRED FORTY OF THIS CHAPTER.
  (II) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  A
 COURT  MAKING  A  DETERMINATION  THAT  LIMITATIONS  OR RESTRICTIONS OF A
 PARTY'S CUSTODY, VISITATION OR CONTACT WITH THE CHILD ARE  NECESSARY  TO
 AVOID  SIGNIFICANT  RISK  TO  THE  CHILD'S  LIFE OR SAFETY SHALL ISSUE A
 TEMPORARY EMERGENCY ORDER FOR CUSTODY OR VISITATION STATING AS SUCH.
  (III) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION  OF  LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,

 DESCRIBED PURSUANT TO SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FORTY-D  OF  THIS  CHAPTER.
 FURTHER,  THE  COURT  SHALL  NOT  TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHETHER EITHER
 PARTY IS MARRIED, WAS FORMERLY MARRIED OR HAS EVER BEEN MARRIED  TO  THE
