  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
  LBD06231-12-4
 A. 3346--C  2
 
  THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THAT THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IS OF PARAMOUNT
 IMPORTANCE  AND  IS AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF THEIR BEST INTERESTS. TO THAT
 END, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS REGARDING CUSTODY OF,
 AND ACCESS TO, CHILDREN SHALL PROMOTE THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN AS A THRES-
 HOLD ISSUE.
  §  3.  Paragraphs (a) and (a-1) of subdivision 1 of section 240 of the
 domestic relations law, paragraph (a) as amended by chapter 567  of  the
 laws  of  2015 and paragraph (a-1) as amended by chapter 295 of the laws
 of 2009, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) In any action or proceeding brought (1) to annul a marriage or  to
 declare  the nullity of a void marriage, or (2) for a separation, or (3)
 for a divorce, or (4) to obtain, by a writ of habeas corpus or by  peti-
 tion and order to show cause, the custody of or right to visitation with
 any  child  of  a  marriage, the court shall require verification of the
 status of any child of the marriage with respect to such child's custody
 and support, including any prior orders,  and  shall  enter  orders  for
 custody  and  support  as,  in the court's discretion, justice requires,
 having regard to the circumstances of the case  and  of  the  respective
 parties  and  to  the  best  interests  of  the child and subject to the
 provisions of subdivision one-c of this section.  WHEN THE PARTIES FIRST
 APPEAR IN COURT, THE COURT SHALL ADVISE THE PARTIES BEFORE PROCEEDING OF
 THE RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OF THEIR  OWN  CHOOSING,  OF  THE
 RIGHT  TO  HAVE  AN ADJOURNMENT OF NO LONGER THAN FOURTEEN COURT DAYS TO
 CONFER WITH COUNSEL, AND THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN COUNSEL FEES AND  EXPENSES,
 PURSUANT  TO SECTION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE. THE COURT
 SHALL ASSIGN COUNSEL TO THE ELIGIBLE PARTIES AND CHILDREN,  PURSUANT  TO
 ARTICLE  TWO OF THE FAMILY COURT ACT AND SUBDIVISIONS SEVEN AND EIGHT OF
 SECTION THIRTY-FIVE OF THE JUDICIARY  LAW.  Where  either  party  to  an
 action  concerning  custody  of  or  a  right to visitation with a child
 alleges in a sworn petition or complaint or  sworn  answer,  cross-peti-
 tion,  counterclaim  or  other  sworn responsive pleading that the other
 party has committed an act of domestic violence against the party making
 the allegation or a family or household member of either party, as  such
 family  or  household  member  is defined in article eight of the family
 court act, and such allegations are proven by  a  preponderance  of  the
 evidence,  the  court  [must] SHALL consider the effect of such domestic
 violence upon the best interests of the child, together with such  other
 facts  and  circumstances as the court deems relevant in making a direc-
 tion pursuant to this section and state on the record how such findings,
 facts and circumstances factored into the direction. If a parent makes a
 good faith allegation based on a reasonable belief  supported  by  facts
 that  the  child  is  the  victim  of child abuse, child neglect, or the
 effects of domestic violence, and if that parent acts  lawfully  and  in
 good faith in response to that reasonable belief to protect the child or
 seek  treatment for the child, then that parent shall not be deprived of
 custody, visitation or contact with the child, or restricted in custody,
 visitation or contact, based solely on that  belief  or  the  reasonable
 actions  taken  based  on  that belief. If an allegation that a child is
 abused is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, then  the  court
 shall  consider  such  evidence  of  abuse in determining the visitation
 arrangement that is in the best interest of the  child,  and  the  court
 shall  not  place  a  child  in  the  custody of a parent who presents a
 substantial risk of harm to that child, and shall state  on  the  record
 how such findings were factored into the determination. Where a proceed-
 ing  filed  pursuant  to article ten or ten-A of the family court act is
 pending at the same time as a proceeding brought in  the  supreme  court
 A. 3346--C  3
 
 involving  the  custody  of, or right to visitation with, any child of a
 marriage, the court presiding over the proceeding under article  ten  or
 ten-A of the family court act may jointly hear the dispositional hearing
 on  the petition under article ten or the permanency hearing under arti-
 cle ten-A of the family court act and, upon referral  from  the  supreme
 court, the hearing to resolve the matter of custody or visitation in the
 proceeding  pending  in  the  supreme court; provided however, the court
 [must] SHALL determine custody or  visitation  in  accordance  with  the
 terms of this section.
  An  order  directing  the  payment  of child support shall contain the
 social security numbers of the named parties. In all cases  there  shall
 be  no  prima  facie right to the custody of the child in either parent.
 Such direction shall make provision for child support out of the proper-
 ty of either or both parents. The court shall make its award  for  child
 support  pursuant  to  subdivision one-b of this section. Such direction
 may provide for reasonable visitation  rights  to  the  maternal  and/or
 paternal  grandparents of any child of the parties. Such direction as it
 applies to rights of visitation with a child remanded or placed  in  the
 care  of  a  person, official, agency or institution pursuant to article
 ten of the family court act, or pursuant to an instrument approved under
 section three hundred fifty-eight-a of the social services law, shall be
 enforceable pursuant to part eight of article ten of  the  family  court
 act  and  sections three hundred fifty-eight-a and three hundred eighty-
 four-a of the social services law and other applicable provisions of law
 against any person having care and custody, or temporary care and custo-
 dy, of the child. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any  writ-
 ten  application or motion to the court for the establishment, modifica-
 tion or enforcement of a child support obligation  for  persons  not  in
 receipt  of  public  assistance  and  care [must] SHALL contain either a
 request for child support enforcement services which would authorize the
 collection of the support obligation by the  immediate  issuance  of  an
 income  execution  for support enforcement as provided for by this chap-
 ter, completed in the manner specified in section one  hundred  eleven-g
 of  the  social  services  law;  or  a  statement that the applicant has
 applied for or is in receipt of such services; or a statement  that  the
 applicant  knows of the availability of such services, has declined them
 at this time and where support enforcement services pursuant to  section
 one  hundred eleven-g of the social services law have been declined that
 the applicant understands that an income deduction order may  be  issued
 pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of section fifty-two hundred forty-two of
 the civil practice law and rules without other child support enforcement
 services and that payment of an administrative fee may be required.  The
 court  shall  provide  a  copy  of  any  such  request for child support
 enforcement services to the support collection unit of  the  appropriate
 social services district any time it directs payments to be made to such
 support  collection  unit.  Additionally,  the  copy of any such request
 shall be accompanied by the name, address and social security number  of
 the  parties;  the date and place of the parties' marriage; the name and
 date of birth of the child or children; and the name and address of  the
 employers  and  income  payors  of  the party from whom child support is
 sought or from the party ordered to  pay  child  support  to  the  other
 party.  Such direction may require the payment of a sum or sums of money
 either directly to the custodial parent or to third persons for goods or
 services furnished for such child, or for both payments to the custodial
 parent and to such third persons; provided,  however,  that  unless  the
 party seeking or receiving child support has applied for or is receiving
 A. 3346--C  4

 such  services,  the  court shall not direct such payments to be made to
 the support collection unit,  as  established  in  section  one  hundred
 eleven-h  of  the social services law. Every order directing the payment
 of support shall require that if either parent currently, or at any time
 in  the  future,  has  health  insurance  benefits available that may be
 extended or obtained to cover the child,  such  parent  is  required  to
 exercise  the  option  of additional coverage in favor of such child and
 execute and deliver to such person  any  forms,  notices,  documents  or
 instruments  necessary  to assure timely payment of any health insurance
 claims for such child.
  (a-1)(1) [Permanent and initial temporary orders of custody or visita-
 tion. Prior to the issuance of any permanent or initial temporary  order
 of  custody or visitation, the court shall conduct a review of the deci-
 sions and reports listed in subparagraph three of this paragraph.
  (2) Successive temporary orders of custody or visitation. Prior to the
 issuance of any successive temporary order of custody or visitation, the
 court shall conduct a review of the  decisions  and  reports  listed  in
 subparagraph  three  of  this  paragraph,  unless such a review has been
 conducted within ninety days prior to the issuance of such order.
  (3) Decisions and reports for review. The court shall conduct a review
 of] PROMPT EVIDENTIARY HEARING. UPON THE APPLICATION OF ANY PARTY TO  AN
 ACTION CONCERNING CUSTODY OF OR VISITATION WITH A CHILD, OR OF AN ATTOR-
 NEY  FOR  THE  CHILD,  ASSERTING  CREDIBLE  ALLEGATIONS  OF INCIDENTS OR
 THREATS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE  OR  CHILD  NEGLECT  THAT,  IF
 TRUE,  WOULD POSE A SERIOUS OR IMMINENT RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD,
 THE COURT SHALL HOLD A PROMPT EVIDENTIARY HEARING TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER
 TEMPORARY  LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON THE CUSTODY OR VISITATION RIGHTS
 OF THE PARTY WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED OR  THREATENED  TO  COMMIT
 DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE,  CHILD ABUSE OR CHILD NEGLECT ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID
 SERIOUS OR IMMINENT RISK TO THE CHILD'S SAFETY. EXCEPT  FOR  GOOD  CAUSE
 SHOWN,  THE  HEARING FOR SUCH DETERMINATION SHALL COMMENCE WITHIN TWENTY
 COURT DAYS OF THE APPLICATION FOR SUCH HEARING.  THE COURT SHALL  REMIND
 THE  PARTIES  OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL FOR THE PROMPT
 EVIDENTIARY HEARING.  DURING SUCH HEARING, ONLY  MATERIAL  AND  RELEVANT
 EVIDENCE  SHALL  BE  ADMITTED.  IF  A PARTY WAIVES HIS OR HER RIGHT TO A
 HEARING UNDER THIS SECTION, THE COURT SHALL ADVISE SUCH  PARTY  AT  THAT
 TIME  THAT,  NOTWITHSTANDING  SUCH  WAIVER,  AN  APPLICATION  UNDER THIS
 SECTION MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE  PROCEEDINGS.
 AFTER  A  HEARING  HAS BEEN HELD PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION, A PARTY MAY
 REQUEST A SUBSEQUENT PROMPT EVIDENTIARY HEARING DURING THE  PENDENCY  OF
 LITIGATION  FOR  GOOD CAUSE SHOWN.  DURING A PROMPT EVIDENTIARY HEARING,
 THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER the following, IF AVAILABLE:
  (i) related decisions in court proceedings initiated pursuant to arti-
 cle ten of the family court act, and all warrants issued under the fami-
 ly court act; [and]
  (ii) ANY PARTY'S HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, CHILD  ABUSE  OR  CHILD
 NEGLECT,  CHILD  SEXUAL ABUSE OR INCIDENTS INVOLVING HARM TO A CHILD, OR

 REPORTING  OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING CHILD ABUSE, CHILD NEGLECT OR DOMESTIC
 VIOLENCE BY A PARTY;

 conclusions and recommendations not later than January first, two  thou-
 sand  nine,  and a final report of findings, conclusions and recommenda-
 tions not later than June first, two thousand  nine,  and  shall  submit

  § 4. The domestic relations law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 240-e to read as follows:
  § 240-E. CUSTODY AND VISITATION; SAFETY OF THE CHILD.  THE LEGISLATURE
 RECOGNIZES THAT THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND IS
 AN  INTEGRAL  ELEMENT OF THEIR BEST INTERESTS. TO THAT END, THE LEGISLA-
 TURE FINDS THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS REGARDING CUSTODY OF, AND ACCESS  TO,
 CHILDREN  SHALL  PROMOTE THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN AS A THRESHOLD ISSUE. 1.

 ING DIRECT PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL HARM TO SUCH CHILD.  IN  MAKING  SUCH
