 Introduced by M. of A. ANDERSON -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public authorities law, in relation to the Long

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known as the "Long Island
 Rail Road Fare Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The New York state  legislature  has  found
 that  on  the  weekends  the  Long Island Rail Road, a subsidiary of the
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority, provides reduced fare between the
 hours of 12:01 AM Saturday until 11:59  AM  Sunday  at  certain  station
 locations.  Passengers  traveling  to and from locations within New York
 city should not forfeit their enjoyment of  such  reduced  fare  because
 their train happens to pass through Nassau county.
  §  3.  Section 1266 of the public authorities law is amended by adding
 a new subdivision 14-a to read as follows:
  14-A. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW OR THE TERMS OF  ANY
 CONTRACT,  THE  LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD SHALL INCLUDE FAR ROCKAWAY STATION
 IN ITS NEW YORK CITY WEEKEND REDUCED FARE PROGRAM.  SUCH  STATION  SHALL
 ENJOY THE SAME BENEFITS AS ALL OTHER STATIONS INCLUDED IN SUCH PROGRAM.
  §  4. This act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.
