  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to
  the Committee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law and the  executive  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  the  "New  York  state  lead-safe renovation, repair and
  painting act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  labor law is amended by adding a new article 31-A to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 31-A
  NEW YORK STATE LEAD-SAFE
  RENOVATION, REPAIR AND PAINTING ACT
 SECTION 925. SHORT TITLE.
  926. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  927. DEFINITIONS.
  928. RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY RENOVATION.
  § 925. SHORT TITLE. THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY  BE  CITED  AS
 THE "NEW YORK STATE LEAD-SAFE RENOVATION, REPAIR AND PAINTING ACT".
  § 926. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES
 THAT  LEAD  POISONING  OF CHILDREN PERSISTS AS ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT
 AND PREVENTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL DISEASES IN NEW YORK. NEARLY  ONE  HUNDRED
 THOUSAND  CHILDREN  WERE  NEWLY  IDENTIFIED WITH LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR
 BLOOD AT FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER IN NEW  YORK  STATE  BETWEEN  TWO
 THOUSAND  ELEVEN  AND  TWO  THOUSAND FIFTEEN. MEDICAL RESEARCH INDICATES
 THAT CHILDREN CAN SUFFER PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE  AT  BLOOD  LEVELS  EVEN
 LOWER  THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER, AND THAT THERE IS NO LEVEL OF
 LEAD INGESTION WHICH IS WITHOUT ADVERSE IMPACT.
  THE PREDOMINANT CAUSE OF LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN IS  THE  INGESTION
 OF  LEAD  DUST FROM LEAD-BASED PAINT FROM OLDER RESIDENCES. ALTHOUGH NEW
 YORK STATE BANNED THE SALE  OF  LEAD-BASED  PAINT  IN  NINETEEN  HUNDRED
 SEVENTY,  SEVENTY-FOUR  PERCENT  OF  NEW  YORK'S  HOUSING  STOCK  WAS
 CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND  TEN  PERCENT  OF  NEW
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 2191  2
 
 YORK'S  HOUSING  WAS  CONSTRUCTED  BETWEEN  NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND
 NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-NINE WHILE LEAD-BASED PAINT WAS STILL AVAILABLE
 THROUGH NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT. NEW  YORK  STATE  HAS  BOTH  THE
 NATION'S GREATEST NUMBER (OVER FOUR MILLION UNITS), THE HIGHEST PERCENT-
 AGE  (55.08%)  OF  PRE-NINETEEN  HUNDRED  SIXTY AND PRE-NINETEEN HUNDRED
 FIFTY (41.0%) HOUSING, AND THE OLDEST HOUSING INVENTORY AMONG THE  FIFTY
 STATES.  ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, SOME
 LEAD PAINTED SURFACES CAN BE FOUND  IN  EIGHTY-SEVEN  PERCENT  OF  HOMES
 CONSTRUCTED  BEFORE  NINETEEN HUNDRED FORTY, SIXTY-NINE PERCENT OF HOMES
 CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN NINETEEN HUNDRED FORTY AND NINETEEN  HUNDRED  FIFTY-
 NINE,  AND  TWENTY-FOUR  PERCENT  OF  HOMES CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN NINETEEN
 HUNDRED SIXTY AND NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT. NEW YORK STATE'S OLDER
 HOUSING STOCK PLACES  RESIDENTS  AT  GREAT  RISK  OF  EXPOSURE  TO  LEAD
 HAZARDS,  WITH  LOW-INCOME  CHILDREN  LIVING IN OLDER HOUSING HAVING THE
 HIGHEST RISK OF LEAD POISONING.
  A KEY SOURCE OF LEAD DUST IS RENOVATION, REPAIR, AND PAINTING WORK  IN
 HOMES  THAT  CONTAIN  LEAD-BASED PAINT. THESE ACTIVITIES EXACERBATE LEAD
 DUST LEVELS AND LEAVE HARMFUL DUST FOR MANY YEARS.
  RENOVATION WORKERS OFTEN UNWITTINGLY EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO LEAD HAZARDS
 BY USING UNSAFE WORK PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN EXPOSURE FOR  WORKERS  AND
 THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
  THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) HAS DEVELOPED GUIDE-
 LINES  TO  CONDUCT RENOVATIONS IN A LEAD-SAFE MANNER, KNOWN AS THE RENO-
 VATION, REPAIR, AND PAINTING (RRP) RULE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE RRP RULE
 IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CONTRACTORS AND LANDLORDS  WORKING  IN  HOUSING  AND
 CHILDCARE  FACILITIES  BUILT  BEFORE  NINETEEN  HUNDRED  SEVENTY-EIGHT.
 HOWEVER, THE EPA'S ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES OVER  SIX
 MILLION HOMES IN NEW YORK STATE, IS MINIMAL WITH ONLY SEVEN EPA ENFORCE-
 MENT ACTIONS IN NEW YORK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN.
  MULTIPLE  STUDIES  CONDUCTED  PRIOR  TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RRP RULE
 PRESENT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF  LEAD  DUST  PRODUCED  FROM  SPECIFICALLY
 RENOVATION,  REPAIR,  AND  PAINTING  ACTIVITIES IN HOMES WITH LEAD-BASED
 PAINT. ONE STUDY OF CHILDREN IN NEW YORK IN TWO THOUSAND  SIX-TWO  THOU-
 SAND  SEVEN  FOUND  THAT FOURTEEN PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN WITH EXTREMELY
 HIGH EBLLS (TWENTY MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER AND ABOVE) WERE  RELATED  TO
 RENOVATION,  REPAIR  AND  PAINTING  ACTIVITIES;  ALL THE HOMES LINKED TO
 RRP-RELATED LEAD EXPOSURE WERE BUILT BEFORE  NINETEEN  HUNDRED  SEVENTY-
 EIGHT EXCEPT ONE, AND CHILDREN WITH LOWER EBLLS (LESS THAN TWENTY MICRO-
 GRAMS  PER  DECILITER)  WERE ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY EXPOSED TO
 LEAD THROUGH RRP ACTIVITIES IN NEARLY FORTY PERCENT OF CASES. THIS INDI-
 CATES THAT RENOVATION, REPAIR AND PAINTING ACTIVITIES  ARE  ONE  OF  THE
 PRIMARY  SOURCES  OF  LEAD EXPOSURE IN YOUNG CHILDREN. IF THESE RATES OF
 EXPOSURE FROM RRP ARE EXTRAPOLATED TO HOLD FOR THE ENTIRE NEW YORK STATE
 POPULATION OF LEAD-EXPOSED CHILDREN, APPROXIMATELY NINE  THOUSAND  THREE
 HUNDRED  TWENTY-SEVEN  CHILDREN  BECOME  SUBJECT  TO LEAD POISONING AS A
 RESULT OF RENOVATION, REPAIR, AND  PAINTING  ACTIVITIES  EACH  YEAR.  OF
 THOSE,  TWO  THOUSAND  FOUR  HUNDRED  EIGHTEEN CHILDREN WOULD EXPERIENCE
 SEVERELY HIGH EBLLS OF TWENTY MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER  OR  GREATER  AND
 ABOVE.  THE  SAFE  WORK  PRACTICES  IN THE RRP RULE CAN ALSO PROTECT THE
 HEALTH OF RENOVATION WORKERS.
  THE EPA REGULATIONS PROVIDE THAT STATES CAN OBTAIN DELEGATION FROM THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN  LEAD-SAFE  RENOVATION  PROGRAMS,
 AND  AT  LEAST  FOURTEEN  STATES  HAVE  DONE  SO  AND TAILORED THEIR RRP
 PROGRAMS TO MEET THE  IMPLEMENTATION  AND  ENFORCEMENT  NEEDS  OF  THEIR
 STATE.  WITH  THE  OLDEST  HOUSING  STOCK IN THE NATION, NEW YORK HAS AN
 ESPECIALLY SERIOUS LEAD POISONING PROBLEM AND  URGENTLY  NEEDS  TO  SEEK
 S. 2191  3
 
 AUTHORIZATION  FOR  THIS  PROGRAM. DOING SO WILL GIVE STATE AGENCIES THE
 AUTHORITY  TO  ENFORCE  EXISTING  REGULATIONS  AND  THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO
 STRENGTHEN THEM IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER.
  § 927. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS ARTICLE, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL
 HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  1.  "LEAD-BASED  PAINT"  MEANS  PAINT OR OTHER SIMILAR SURFACE COATING
 MATERIAL CONTAINING 1.0 MILLIGRAMS OF  LEAD  PER  SQUARE  CENTIMETER  OR
 GREATER,  AS DETERMINED BY LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF PAINT SAMPLES WITH ALL
 LAYERS OF PAINT PRESENT, OR BY AN X-RAY  FLUORESCENCE  ANALYZER.  IF  AN
 X-RAY  FLUORESCENCE  ANALYZER  IS  USED, READINGS SHALL BE CORRECTED FOR
 SUBSTRATE BIAS WHEN NECESSARY AS SPECIFIED BY THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTER-
 ISTIC SHEETS RELEASED BY  THE  UNITED  STATES  ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION
 AGENCY AND THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
 FOR  THE  SPECIFIC  X-RAY FLUORESCENCE ANALYZER USED. X-RAY FLUORESCENCE
 READINGS SHALL BE CLASSIFIED AS POSITIVE, NEGATIVE  OR  INCONCLUSIVE  IN
 ACCORDANCE  WITH THE MOST RECENT UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND
 URBAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES FOR THE EVALUATION  AND  CONTROL  OF  LEAD-
 BASED PAINT HAZARDS IN HOUSING AND THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTIC SHEETS
 RELEASED  BY  THE  UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND THE
 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT  OF  HOUSING  AND  URBAN  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  THE
 SPECIFIC  X-RAY  FLUORESCENCE ANALYZER USED. X-RAY FLUORESCENCE READINGS
 THAT FALL WITHIN THE INCONCLUSIVE ZONE, AS DETERMINED BY THE PERFORMANCE
 CHARACTERISTIC SHEETS, SHALL BE  CONFIRMED  BY  LABORATORY  ANALYSIS  OF
 PAINT  CHIPS, RESULTS SHALL BE REPORTED IN MILLIGRAMS OF LEAD PER SQUARE
 CENTIMETER AND THE MEASURE OF SUCH LABORATORY ANALYSIS SHALL BE  DEFINI-
 TIVE.  IF LABORATORY ANALYSIS IS USED TO DETERMINE LEAD CONTENT, RESULTS
 SHALL BE REPORTED IN MILLIGRAMS OF LEAD PER SQUARE CENTIMETER. WHERE THE
 SURFACE AREA OF A PAINT CHIP SAMPLE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY MEASURED OR  IF
 AN ACCURATELY MEASURED PAINT CHIP SAMPLE CANNOT BE REMOVED, A LABORATORY
 ANALYSIS  MAY BE REPORTED IN PERCENT BY WEIGHT. IN SUCH CASE, LEAD-BASED
 PAINT SHALL MEAN ANY PAINT OR OTHER  SIMILAR  SURFACE  COATING  MATERIAL
 CONTAINING  MORE THAN 0.009% OF METALLIC LEAD, BASED ON THE NON-VOLATILE
 CONTENT OF THE PAINT OR OTHER SIMILAR SURFACE COATING MATERIAL.  IN  THE
 EVENT  THAT  THE  UNITED  STATES  ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION  AGENCY OR A
 SUCCESSOR AGENCY, OR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING  AND  URBAN
 DEVELOPMENT  OR  A  SUCCESSOR  AGENCY,  OR A DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY OF THE
 STATE OF NEW YORK THAT HAS OBTAINED APPLICABLE AUTHORIZATION PURSUANT TO
 40 CFR PART 745 SUBPART Q OR SUCCESSOR REGULATION, ADOPTS MORE STRINGENT
 DEFINITIONS OF LEAD-BASED PAINT, SUCH DEFINITIONS SHALL  APPLY  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2.  "LEAD  DUST  CLEARANCE" MEANS MASS-PER-AREA CONCENTRATIONS OF LEAD
 LESS THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS OF LEAD PER SQUARE FOOT  ON  FLOORS  AND  LESS
 THAN  FORTY  MICROGRAMS  PER  SQUARE  FOOT  ON  INTERIOR  WINDOW  SILLS,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT:
  (A) THE COMMISSIONER MAY BY REGULATION SET MORE STRINGENT  LEVELS  FOR
 LEAD  DUST  CLEARANCE IN THE EVENT THE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES SUCH MORE
 STRINGENT LEVELS ARE NEEDED  TO  IDENTIFY  POTENTIAL  LEAD  HAZARDS  AND
 PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH; AND
  (B)  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  BY REGULATION ADOPT SUCH MORE STRINGENT
 LEVELS FOR LEAD DUST CLEARANCE AS MAY BE SET BY THE UNITED STATES  ENVI-
 RONMENTAL  PROTECTION  AGENCY OR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING
 AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.
  § 928. RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY  RENOVATION.  1.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
