 OF THE PENAL LAW, RAPE IN THE FIRST  DEGREE  AS  SET  FORTH  IN  SECTION
 130.35  OF  THE  PENAL LAW between spouses or former spouses, or between
 parent and child or between members of  the  same  family  or  household
 except  that  if  the  respondent would not be criminally responsible by
 reason of age pursuant to section 30.00 of the penal law, then the fami-
 ly  court  shall  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  such  proceeding.
 Notwithstanding a complainant's election to proceed in family court, the
 criminal  court  shall  not be divested of jurisdiction to hear a family
 offense proceeding pursuant  to  this  section.  For  purposes  of  this
 section,  "disorderly  conduct"  includes  disorderly  conduct  not in a
 public place.  For purposes of this section, "members of the same family
 or household" with respect to a proceeding in the criminal courts  shall
 mean the following:
  (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;
  (b) persons legally married to one another;
  (c) persons formerly married to one another regardless of whether they
 still reside in the same household;
  (d)  persons  who  have  a child in common, regardless of whether such
 persons have been married or have lived together at any time; and
  (e) persons who are not related by consanguinity or affinity  and  who
 are  or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether such
 persons have lived together at any time. Factors the court may  consider
 in  determining  whether  a  relationship  is an "intimate relationship"
 include but are not limited to: the  nature  or  type  of  relationship,
 regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequen-
 cy of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relation-
 ship.  Neither a casual acquaintance nor ordinary fraternization between
 two individuals in business  or  social  contexts  shall  be  deemed  to
 constitute an "intimate relationship".
  §  2. Subdivision 1 of section 812 of the family court act, as amended
 by chapter 326 of the laws of 2008, and the opening paragraph as amended
 by chapter 109 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:

 law,  RAPE  IN  THE  THIRD  DEGREE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 130.25 OF THE

 pursuant to section 30.00 of the penal law, then the family court  shall
 have  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  such  proceeding. Notwithstanding a
 complainant's election to proceed in family court,  the  criminal  court
 shall  not be divested of jurisdiction to hear a family offense proceed-
 ing pursuant to this section. In any proceeding pursuant to  this  arti-
 cle,  a  court shall not deny an order of protection, or dismiss a peti-
 tion, solely on the basis that  the  acts  or  events  alleged  are  not
 relatively contemporaneous with the date of the petition, the conclusion
 of  the fact-finding or the conclusion of the dispositional hearing. For
 purposes of  this  article,  "disorderly  conduct"  includes  disorderly
 conduct not in a public place. For purposes of this article, "members of
 the same family or household" shall mean the following:
  (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;
  (b) persons legally married to one another;
  (c) persons formerly married to one another regardless of whether they
 still reside in the same household;
  (d)  persons  who  have  a  child in common regardless of whether such
 persons have been married or have lived together at any time; and
  (e) persons who are not related by consanguinity or affinity  and  who
 are  or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether such
 persons have lived together at any time. Factors the court may  consider
 in  determining  whether  a  relationship  is an "intimate relationship"
 include but are not limited to: the  nature  or  type  of  relationship,
 regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequen-
 cy of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relation-
 ship.  Neither a casual acquaintance nor ordinary fraternization between
 two individuals in business  or  social  contexts  shall  be  deemed  to
 constitute an "intimate relationship".
