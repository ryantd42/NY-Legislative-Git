  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2, 2023,  as  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  and
  Prevention Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  violence  is  a pattern of coercive behavior and
tactics used by someone against their intimate partner in an attempt  to
gain  or  maintain  power  and  control,  and types of abuse can include
physical, sexual, psychological, technological and economic abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS, Domestic violence is not limited to specific  groups  based
on race, socioeconomic status, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, age, religious affiliation, or social location, but rather is
perpetrated by abusers from all social groups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  average,  nearly  20  people per minute are physically
abused by an intimate partner in the  United  States  --  more  than  10
million people over the course of a year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  one in three women and one in four men have
experienced some form of domestic violence or interpersonal violence  in
their  lifetime,  and  one  in  ten women have been raped by an intimate
partner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  systemic  racism,  racist  policies,  and  racist
societal  structures, both Black women and Black men experience intimate
partner violence at a disproportionately high rate, with 45.1% of  Black
women  and  40.1%  of  Black  men experiencing intimate partner physical
violence, intimate  partner  sexual  violence  and/or  intimate  partner
stalking in their lifetimes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  violence  affects the LGBTQ+ community at a rate
equal to or  even  greater  than  that  experienced  by  the  cisgender,
heterosexual  community,  with  43.8  percent  of  lesbian  women and 26
percent of gay men experiencing rape, physical violence and/or  stalking
by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime, and more than 54
percent  of  the  transgender  and  gender non-conforming community have
reported experiencing some  form  of  intimate  partner  violence,  with
transgender  women  of color experiencing heightened levels of violence;
and
 
  WHEREAS, According  to  a  study  from  the  National  Institute  of
Justice,  more than half of Native American and Alaska Native women have
experienced physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly 20.9 percent of female high school students and 13.4
percent of male high school students report being physically or sexually
abused by a dating partner, and  43  percent  of  dating  college  women
report experiencing violent or abusive behaviors from their partner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Researchers estimate that one in 15 children in the United
States are exposed  to  intimate  partner  violence,  and  children  who
witness intimate partner violence growing up are three times more likely
as their peers to engage in violent behavior; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  violence survivors experience a host of physical
and mental health-related consequences at far greater rates  than  their
counterparts who have not been abused; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  an  annual survey conducted by the National
Network to End Domestic Violence, New York State  consistently  has  the
greatest demand for domestic violence services in the country with 9,157
survivors  requesting  services  on  just  one  day  in  2022,  and  951
unfulfilled service requests on that same day  because  of  insufficient
resources or staff; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2020,  there  were 165,577 orders of protection issued
that required entry in the New York State Registry; and
 
  WHEREAS, The NYS Office of Children  and  Family  Services  reported
that  nearly  48,000  survivors  of domestic violence and their children
received services from New York residential and non-residential domestic
violence service providers, and more than  252,500  hotline  calls  were
received across the State in 2020; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services,
there were 61 intimate partner homicides in New York State in 2020; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  cost  of  a  single  homicide  is estimated at $17.25
million when considering  medical  care,  lost  future  earnings,  other
related  public  programming and services, and property damage and other
losses; and
 
  WHEREAS, The economic burden of  domestic  violence  in  the  United
States is staggering, with costs to the U.S. economy estimated to exceed
$8.3 billion annually, with 21-60 percent of victims of intimate partner
violence losing their jobs due to reasons stemming from the abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Primary  prevention strategies address the root causes and
conditions that make  domestic  violence  possible,  and  public  health
research  has  shown that implementing prevention activities at multiple
levels  on  the  social  ecology  scale  -  individual,  relationship,
community, and societal - will lead to lasting social change; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Primary  prevention  is  focused  on  establishing  gender
equality, cultivating, and promoting healthy relationship behaviors, and
changing conditions in communities and culture to stop domestic violence
before it starts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  violence  advocates  consistently  provide
comprehensive  and  compassionate  life-saving  services,  advocacy, and
support to survivors of domestic  violence  and  their  children,  while
leading essential primary prevention efforts within their communities to
motivate  the  change needed to stop domestic violence from happening in
the first place; and
 
  WHEREAS, As part of  executing  its  mission,  the  New  York  State
Coalition  Against  Domestic  Violence  seeks  to create and support the
social change necessary to prevent and confront all  forms  of  domestic
violence, to ensure the availability and accessibility of innovative and
effective  supports and services for all domestic violence survivors and
 
their families, and to dismantle oppression,  end  systemic  racism  and
uproot the inequities that foster violence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State  needs  to  continually and significantly
invest in services and supports  for  domestic  violence  survivors  and
their  families in order to meet the rising demand for assistance and to
continue progress toward ending domestic violence once and for all;  now
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2, 2023,  as  Domestic
Violence  Awareness  and Prevention Day in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, and the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
