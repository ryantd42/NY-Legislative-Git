 three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage,  unless  the
 governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or her
 hand  and  the  seal of the state, the facts which in his or her opinion
 necessitate an immediate vote thereon, in which case it  must  neverthe-
 less  be  upon  the  desks of the members in final form, not necessarily
 printed, before its final passage; nor  shall  any  bill  be  passed  or
 become  a law, except by the assent of a majority of the members elected

  Section  1. A. Any amendment or amendments to this constitution may be
 proposed in the senate and assembly whereupon such amendment  or  amend-
 ments  shall  be referred to the attorney-general whose duty it shall be
 within twenty days thereafter to render an opinion  in  writing  to  the
 senate  and  assembly  as  to the effect of such amendment or amendments
 upon other provisions of the constitution. Upon receiving such  opinion,
 if the amendment or amendments as proposed or as amended shall be agreed
 to  by a majority of the members elected to each of the two houses, such
 proposed amendment or amendments shall be entered on their journals, and
 the ayes and noes taken thereon, and referred to the next regular legis-
 lative session  convening  after  the  succeeding  general  election  of
 members  of the assembly, and shall be published for three months previ-
 ous to the time of making  such  choice;  and  if  in  such  legislative
 session,  such  proposed amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a
 majority of all the members elected to each house, then it shall be  the
 duty  of the legislature to submit each proposed amendment or amendments
 to the people for approval in such manner  and  at  such  times  as  the
 legislature  shall prescribe; and if the people shall approve and ratify
 such amendment or amendments by a majority of the electors voting there-
 on, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of the constitution
 on the first day of January next after such approval.  Neither the fail-
 ure of the attorney-general to  render  an  opinion  concerning  such  a
 proposed  amendment  nor his or her failure to do so timely shall affect
 [th] THE validity of such proposed amendment or legislative action ther-
 eon.
  B. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN AMENDMENT BY INITIATIVE  SUBJECT
 TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY OF THIS CONSTITUTION.
  §  4.  Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 16 of article 3
 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 16. A. No act shall be passed which shall provide that any  existing
 law, or any part thereof, shall be made or deemed a part of said act, or
 which  shall  enact  that  any  existing  law, or part thereof, shall be
 applicable, except by inserting it in such act.
  B. THIS SECTION SHALL  NOT  APPLY  TO  ANY  INITIATIVE  OR  REFERENDUM
 SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY OF THIS CONSTITUTION.
  § 5. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 7 of article 4 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  7.  A.  Every  bill which shall have passed the senate and assembly
 shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to  the  governor;  if  the
 governor  approve,  he or she shall sign it; but if not, he or she shall
 return it with his or her objections to the house in which it shall have
 originated, which shall enter the objections at large  on  the  journal,
 and  proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration, two-thirds
 of the members elected to that house shall agree to pass  the  bill,  it
 shall be sent together with the objections, to the other house, by which
 it  shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of the
 members elected to that house, it shall become a law notwithstanding the
 objections of the governor. In all such cases the votes in  both  houses
 shall  be  determined  by  yeas  and  nays, and the names of the members
 voting shall be entered on the journal of each  house  respectively.  If
 any  bill shall not be returned by the governor within ten days (Sundays
 excepted) after it shall have been presented to him  or  her,  the  same
 shall  be a law in like manner as if he or she had signed it, unless the
 legislature shall, by their adjournment, prevent its  return,  in  which
 case  it shall not become a law without the approval of the governor. No
 bill shall become a law after the final adjournment of the  legislature,
 S. 2290  3
 
 unless  approved  by the governor within thirty days after such adjourn-
 ment. If any bill presented to the governor  contain  several  items  of
 appropriation  of  money, the governor may object to one or more of such
 items while approving of the other portion of the bill. In such case the
 governor  shall  append to the bill, at the time of signing it, a state-
 ment of the items to which he or she objects; and the  appropriation  so
 objected  to shall not take effect. If the legislature be in session, he
 or she shall transmit to the house in which the bill originated  a  copy
 of  such statement, and the items objected to shall be separately recon-
 sidered. If on reconsideration one or more of such items be approved  by
 two-thirds  of the members elected to each house, the same shall be part
 of the law, notwithstanding the objections  of  the  governor.  All  the
 provisions  of  this  section,  in relation to bills not approved by the
 governor, shall apply in  cases  in  which  he  or  she  shall  withhold
 approval from any item or items contained in a bill appropriating money.
  B.  THIS  SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY INITIATIVE OR REFERENDUM THAT
 IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY OF THIS CONSTITUTION.

 tution be renumbered article 21 and a new article 20 be added to read as
