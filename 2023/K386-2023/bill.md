  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  is  one  of the fastest growing cancer
diagnoses in the United States, increasing more than 400% in the past 20
years; the cancer kills 1 American every 36 minutes each and every  day;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer is among the deadliest of cancers, with 1
in  5  patients surviving 5 years, and has low survival rates because it
is usually discovered at advanced stages  when  treatment  outcomes  are
poor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  is  more  common  among men than among
women, and the lifetime risk of esophageal cancer in the  United  States
is about 1 in 125 in men and about 1 in 417 in women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2023, the American Cancer Society estimates 17,030 men
and 4,530 women will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer and 12,920  men
and 3,200 women will die from the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  makes  up  about  1%  of  all  cancers
diagnosed in the United States, but it is much more common in some other
parts of the world, such as Iran, northern China,  India,  and  southern
Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  many people with esophageal cancer will go on to
die from this disease, treatment has improved  and  survival  rates  are
getting  better;  during  the 1960s and 1970s, only about 5% of patients
survived at least 5 years after being diagnosed;  today,  about  21%  of
patients survive at least 5 years after diagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer in the United States is most often caused
by  persistent  heartburn or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), yet
many who are at risk are  unaware  of  the  potential  danger  GERD  can
present when it occurs over several weeks or months; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  can  be  a silent killer with patients
often unaware that the cough, hoarse voice, sore throat  or  chest  pain
they  suffer  can  be signs of GERD and are reasons to discuss screening
for esophageal cancer with their health care professional; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer can develop from GERD  when  fluids  from
the  stomach  splash  up  to  create  cellular  change  in the esophagus
resulting in a precancerous condition known as Barrett's Esophagus which
can lead to a 125-fold  increase  in  a  patient's  risk  of  developing
esophageal cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal cancer can be prevented through early detection
of its precursor, Barrett's Esophagus, which can be  treated  with  new,
curative outpatient techniques; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  Cancer  Action  Network  (ECAN)  is working to
improve public awareness of the link between heartburn  and  cancer  and
supports progress in early detection and treatment of esophageal cancer;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  awareness,  along with improvements in
prevention, early detection and treatment strategies, will  enhance  the
health and well-being of all Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as  Esophageal
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
