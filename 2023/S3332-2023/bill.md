  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivisions  3 and 4 of section 376-a of the vehicle and
 traffic law, subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 856 of the laws of 1990
 and subdivision 4 as amended by chapter 302 of the  laws  of  2013,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  3.  If  the  vehicle  is  being driven or operated in violation of any

 equipment, except a violation  described  in  subdivision  two  of  this
 section,  subdivision  THIRTY-ONE, THIRTY-ONE-A, THIRTY-ONE-B, OR forty-
 seven of section three hundred seventy-five of this article, and  except
