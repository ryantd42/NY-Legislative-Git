 Introduced  by M. of A. GOODELL -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Social Services
 
 AN ACT to amend the social  services  law,  in  relation  to  additional
  options  for  local  social  services districts to implement effective
  welfare-to-work programs; and to repeal section 341 of such law relat-
  ing thereto

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent.  The legislature hereby finds that it
 is in the public interest to  assist  public  assistance  recipients  to
 obtain  job  training  or  work experience as a means of enhancing their
 ability to obtain employment, thereby increasing their  financial  inde-
 pendence and self-sufficiency and improving their standard of living. By
 providing  local  social  services districts with additional flexibility
 and more options for the administration of the welfare-to-work  program,
 local  social  services  districts  will  be  able to intervene and seek
 conciliation quickly in the event that  a  public  assistance  recipient
 fails  to  attend  or participate in designated training or work experi-
 ence, thereby maximizing the opportunity for the recipient  to  success-
 fully  participate in these programs. In the event an able-bodied public
 assistance recipient refuses to participate in  these  programs  without
 good  cause,  local  social services districts would have the ability to
 conduct a fair hearing using video conferencing equipment, thus minimiz-
 ing the cost to taxpayers for recipients who are  unwilling  to  partic-
 ipate without good cause.
  §  2.  Section  341  of  the social services law is REPEALED and a new
 section 341 is added to read as follows:
  § 341. CONCILIATION; REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE.  1. NOTICE OF  NONCOMPLI-
 ANCE.  CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS AND THIS TITLE, IF A
 PARTICIPANT HAS FAILED OR REFUSED TO COMPLY  WITH  THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF
 THIS  TITLE,  THE SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT SHALL NOTIFY THE PARTICIPANT,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 VERBALLY OR IN WRITING, IN PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT SUCH FAILURE  OR  REFUSAL
 HAS  TAKEN PLACE, THE SPECIFIC INSTANCE OR INSTANCES OF REFUSAL OR FAIL-
 URE TO COMPLY, AND THE NECESSARY ACTIONS THAT MUST BE TAKEN TO  AVOID  A
 PRO-RATA  REDUCTION IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BENEFITS. THE NOTICE SHALL ALSO
 INCLUDE AN EXPLANATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE OF WHAT WOULD  CONSTITUTE  GOOD
 CAUSE  FOR  NON  COMPLIANCE AND EXAMPLES OF ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF EVIDENCE
 THAT MAY WARRANT AN EXEMPTION FROM WORK ACTIVITIES,  INCLUDING  EVIDENCE
 OF  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE,  AND  PHYSICAL  OR  MENTAL HEALTH LIMITATIONS TO
 DEMONSTRATE SUCH GOOD CAUSE FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE  REQUIREMENTS
 OF  THIS  TITLE.  IF  THE  NOTIFICATION  WAS VERBAL, THE SOCIAL SERVICES
 DISTRICT SHALL PROMPTLY SEND THE PARTICIPANT WRITTEN CONFIRMATION THERE-
 OF.
  2. RIGHT TO CONCILIATION.  (A) AT THE OPTION OF  THE  SOCIAL  SERVICES

 ANCE  IN  AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE REASONS FOR ANY FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF
 THE PARTICIPANT TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF  THIS  TITLE  AND  TO
 ENABLE  THE  PARTICIPANT TO AVOID A PRO-RATA REDUCTION IN PUBLIC ASSIST-
 ANCE BENEFITS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SET FORTH IN  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED
 FORTY-TWO  OF  THIS TITLE.  IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTIC-
 IPANT TO GIVE REASONS FOR SUCH FAILURE OR REFUSAL  TO  COMPLY  WITH  THE
 REQUIREMENTS  OF THIS TITLE.  IF THE SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT DETERMINES
 AS A RESULT OF SUCH CONCILIATION PROCESS THAT SUCH  FAILURE  OR  REFUSAL
 WAS  NOT  WILLFUL  AND  WAS  FOR  GOOD CAUSE, NO FURTHER ACTION SHALL BE
 TAKEN.
  (B) IF THE CONCILIATION EFFORT WAS NOT UNDERTAKEN AT THE SAME TIME  AS
 THE VERBAL NOTICE OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR IN THE EVENT THE NOTICE OF NONCOM-
 PLIANCE  WAS  IN WRITING, THEN THE SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT MUST PROVIDE
 THE PARTICIPANT WITH WRITTEN NOTICE THAT THE PARTICIPANT HAS SEVEN  DAYS
 TO  REQUEST  CONCILIATION  WITH  THE  DISTRICT REGARDING SUCH FAILURE OR
 REFUSAL IN THE CASE OF A SAFETY NET PARTICIPANT AND TEN DAYS IN THE CASE
 OF A FAMILY ASSISTANCE PARTICIPANT. IF  SUCH  PARTICIPANT  CONTACTS  THE
 SOCIAL  SERVICES  DISTRICT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS IN THE CASE OF A SAFETY NET
 PARTICIPANT OR WITHIN TEN DAYS  IN  THE  CASE  OF  A  FAMILY  ASSISTANCE
 PARTICIPANT,  IT  WILL  BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTICIPANT TO GIVE
 REASONS FOR SUCH FAILURE OR REFUSAL. UNLESS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT
 OF THE PARTICIPANT AND THE SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT, CONCILIATION  SHALL
 TERMINATE  AND A DETERMINATION SHALL BE MADE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE

 MINES AS THE RESULT OF SUCH CONCILIATION PROCESS THAT  SUCH  FAILURE  OR
 REFUSAL  WAS  WILLFUL  AND  WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE
 PARTICIPANT DOES NOT CONTACT THE SOCIAL  SERVICES  DISTRICT  WITHIN  THE
 SPECIFIED  NUMBER  OF  DAYS  TO  REQUEST CONCILIATION, THEN THE DISTRICT
