  COMMEMORATING the 25th Anniversary of The Campaign
  Against Hunger in December of 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body that the quality
and character of life in this great Empire State is greatly enriched  by
the  faithful  and  diligent  work of those organizations which serve to
meet the needs of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of The Campaign Against  Hunger  to  be
celebrated in December of 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Campaign  Against  Hunger (TCAH) is a community-based
service organization in Brooklyn,  New  York;  today,  the  organization
provides services to over 300,000 unique individuals each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1998,  Dr. Melony Samuels founded a small, traditional
food pantry located in a church basement; the TCAH  resulted  from  this
effort and it formally became a nonprofit in 2005; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  key  programs  offered  by  TCAH  are the Green Teens
Internship Program, the Weekend Healthy Snack Program  (WHSP),  and  the
SuperChoice Food Pantry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, under the luminous leadership of Dr. Melony Samuels,
founder and executive director, The Campaign Against Hunger continues to
evolve  as  food insecurity, economic inequality, and health disparities
continue to plague our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of The Campaign Against  Hunger  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the  efforts of its Board of Directors and staff, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  institution  and  the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful  care  on behalf of improving the quality and dignity of life
in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary  of  The  Campaign  Against  Hunger  in
December of 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Campaign Against Hunger.
