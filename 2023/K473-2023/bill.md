  WHEREAS, Around the  country,  culinary  schools,  restaurants,  and
kitchens will be honoring chefs for their inventive recipes and creative
dishes;  the month-long celebration spotlights the best in the industry,
the latest trends and what is exciting in the culinary world; and
 
  WHEREAS, From delicate pastries to the freshest seafood  dishes  and
spice  combinations,  chefs and cooks hone their skills daily to stay on
the edge of culinary perfection; and

Century  environment,  the  William  Floyd  Hospitality Services Academy

Brookhaven  on  Long  Island, continues to add new and exciting academic
opportunities for students with the Career and Technical Education (CTE)
academy programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The goal  of  the  CTE  program,  along  with  the  already
thriving Business Education Department, is to give students a variety of
options  to  explore  their  interests  and  get  a  head start on their
secondary education or careers; and
 
  WHEREAS, This offers a two-year course in culinary arts; the  course
of  study includes classroom instruction and practical experience in the
skills and theory needed to be employed in a  variety  of  food  service
professions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Students  will learn in a fully-equipped kitchen, which is
equivalent to those found in restaurants around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Successful completion of the program provides students with
an opportunity to earn up to  seven  advanced  college  credits  through
Suffolk  County Community College's Beacon Program; these credits may be
 
applied to the following SCCC programs of  study:  Culinary,  Baking  or
Hotel Management; and

professionals who create and inspire them should be  recognized  by  all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
