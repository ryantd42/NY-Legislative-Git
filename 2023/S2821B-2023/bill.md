 S. 2821  5
 
 financial services shall consider: (1) the current cost to employees  of
 the  family  leave benefit and any expected change in the cost after the
 benefit increase; (2) the current number of insurers  issuing  insurance

 calendar  years,  the  family leave benefit level that shall take effect
 immediately following the delay shall be the  same  benefit  level  that

 ly  leave  that  occurs on or after January first, two thousand eighteen

 employee's  wages  at the time of family leave are less than one hundred
 dollars per week, the employee shall receive [his  or  her]  THEIR  full
 wages.  Benefits may be payable to employees for paid family leave taken
 intermittently or for less than a full work week in  increments  of  one

 LY  WAGE IN EFFECT; EXCEPT THAT IF THE EMPLOYEE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE IS

 WAGE.  The  weekly  benefit  which  the disabled employee is entitled to
 receive for disability  commencing  on  or  after  May  first,  nineteen
 hundred eighty-nine shall be one-half of the employee's weekly wage, but
 in no case shall such benefit exceed one hundred seventy dollars; except

 weekly wage is less than twenty dollars, the benefit shall be such aver-
 age weekly wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is enti-
 tled  to receive for disability commencing on or after July first, nine-
 teen hundred eighty-three and prior  to  July  first,  nineteen  hundred

 in no case shall such benefit exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars nor
 be less than twenty dollars; except that if the employee's average week-
 ly  wage  is  less than twenty dollars the benefit shall be such average

 three,  shall  be one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but in
 no case shall such benefit exceed ninety-five dollars nor be  less  than
 twenty  dollars;  except  that  if the employee's average weekly wage is

 seventy  and prior to July first, nineteen hundred seventy-four shall be
 one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but  in  no  case  shall
 such  benefit  exceed  seventy-five  dollars  nor  be  less  than twenty
 dollars; except that if the employee's average weekly wage is less  than
 twenty  dollars  the  benefit shall be such average weekly wage. For any
 period of disability less than a full week, the benefits  payable  shall
 be  calculated  by  dividing  the  weekly  benefit  by the number of the
 employee's normal work days per week and multiplying the quotient by the
 number of normal work days in such  period  of  disability.  The  weekly
 benefit  for  a disabled employee who is concurrently eligible for bene-
 fits in the employment of more than one covered employer  shall,  within
 the maximum and minimum herein provided, be (I) one-half of the total of
 the  employee's  average  weekly  wages  received  from all such covered
 employers, OR (II) FOR DISABILITY COMMENCING ON OR AFTER JANUARY  FIRST,

 EMPLOYEE'S  AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE RECEIVED FROM ALL SUCH COVERED EMPLOYERS
 THAT IS MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE NEW  YORK  STATE  AVERAGE  WEEKLY
 WAGE  IN  EFFECT,  and  shall  be  allocated  in the proportion of their
 respective average weekly wage payments.

 wise  eligible  to  receive benefits under this section at the time such
