 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  authorizing  the county of Nassau assessor to
  accept an application for a real property tax exemption from the Mari-
  time Administration, a component of the United  States  Department  of
  Transportation

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the Maritime Administration, a component of the United States Department
 of Transportation, an application for exemption from real property taxes
 pursuant to section 406 of the real property tax law with respect to the
 2021-2022 assessment roll for all of the 2021-2022 school taxes and  all
 of  the  2022 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such organization
 located at 307 Steamboat Road, village of Kings Point, county of Nassau,
 otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 1 block 200 lot 1. If
 accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had  been  received
 on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
