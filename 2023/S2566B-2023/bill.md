 Introduced  by  Sen.  COONEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to medical marihuana;
  and to amend chapter 90 of the  laws  of  2014,  amending  the  public
  health  law  and  other  laws relating to medical use of marihuana, in
  relation to the effectiveness thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The compassionate care act provides
 patients with necessary access to medical marihuana. While  the  program
 has  provided  relief  to  numerous  patients,  several improvements are
 necessary.  Specifically, the program has suffered from overly  restric-
 tive requirements regarding market participation and product regulation.
 Currently,  the  program restricts access by only permitting one dispen-
 sary for every 500,000 New Yorkers - leaving both urban and rural commu-
 nities drastically underserved.  This  act  will  improve  the  existing
 program  by  providing  opportunities  for  social  equity applicants to
 participate in the marketplace in a manner that more accurately  repres-
 ents  the  demographics  of  the  state.  Social  equity applicants will
 include  applicants  from  communities  disproportionately  impacted  by
 cannabis  law enforcement.  This act will also provide necessary flexi-
 bility for market participants to offer products that are more  accessi-
 ble  and  affordable  to  some  of  New York's most vulnerable citizens.
 Specifically, current restrictions on the sale of whole flower result in
 medical products that are cost-prohibitive to many. Moreover,  this  act
 will  provide  greater access to individuals who are unable to enroll in
 the program including those with Alzheimer's disease and who  have  been
 diagnosed  with  autism  spectrum  disorder.  Much  like the addition of
 chronic pain as a qualifying condition, this will allow medical  practi-
 tioners  to recommend an alternative to addictive opiates. These changes
 will give New Yorkers access to quality care they deserve.
