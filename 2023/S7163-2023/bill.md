 AN ACT to authorize Top Community Development  Corporation  to  file  an
  application for a real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the commissioner of the New York city department of  finance  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from  Top  Community  Development Corporation an
 application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to  section
 420-a of the real property tax law for the 2019 assessment roll, for the
 parcel  located  in  the  county of Kings at 1274 Utica Avenue otherwise
 known as section Brooklyn, 03 block 4760 lot 12, 03 block 4761  lot  53,
 03  block 4761 lot 58. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as
 if it had been received on or before the taxable status date established
 for such roll.
  If satisfied that the Top  Community  Development  Corporation:  (i)
 acquired  title  to the property for which it seeks exemption subsequent
 to the taxable status date established for such roll and  prior  to  the
 taxable  status date for the next ensuing assessment roll and (ii) would
 otherwise be entitled to such exemption if  such  entity  had  filed  an
 application  for  exemption  by the appropriate taxable status date, the
 commissioner of the New York city department of finance,  upon  approval
 by  the  city  council of the city of New York, may grant exemption from
 all taxation beginning with the date of acquisition of the  property  by
 such  entity  and  make  appropriate  correction to the subject roll. If
 exemption is granted and such entity therefore shall have paid  any  tax
 with  respect to the subject roll, the department of finance may, in its
 sole discretion, provide for the refund of those  taxes  paid  including
 the  amount  of  any  taxes  held in escrow pursuant to the sale of such
 property and  cancel  taxes,  fines,  penalties  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
