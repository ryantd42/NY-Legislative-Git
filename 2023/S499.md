  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Subdivision 16 of section 103 of the general municipal law,
 as amended by chapter 497 of the laws of 2013, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  16.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions one, two and three
 of this section, and section one hundred four of this article, any offi-
 cer, board or agency of a political subdivision or of any district ther-
 ein authorized to make purchases of apparatus, materials,  equipment  or
 supplies, or to contract for services related to the installation, main-
 tenance  or repair of apparatus, materials, equipment, and supplies, may
 make such purchases, or may contract for [such] services [related to the
 installation, maintenance or repair of apparatus, materials,  equipment,
 and  supplies],  as  may  be  required  by such political subdivision or
 district therein through the use of a contract let by the United  States
 of  America  or  any  agency  thereof,  any state or any other political
 subdivision or district therein if such contract was let to  the  lowest
 responsible  bidder or on the basis of best value in a manner consistent
 with this section and made available for use by other governmental enti-
 ties; provided, however, that no political subdivision or district ther-
 ein, other than a city with a population of one million or more inhabit-
 ants or any district, board  or  agency  with  jurisdiction  exclusively
 therein,  may  make such purchases or contract for such services through
 the use of such a contract let on the basis of best value  in  a  manner
 consistent  with  this  section  unless  the  political  subdivision  or
 district shall first adopt a local law, rule, regulation or  resolution,

 as the case may be, pursuant to subdivision one of this section, author-
 izing the use of best value for awarding purchase contracts.
  The authority provided to political subdivisions and districts therein
 pursuant  to  this  subdivision shall not relieve any obligation of such
 political subdivision or district therein to comply with any  applicable
 minority  and  women-owned  business enterprise program mandates and the
 preferred source requirements of section one hundred  sixty-two  of  the
 state finance law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately; provided, that the amend-
 ments  to  subdivision  16  of section 103 of the general municipal law,
 made by section one of this act, shall not affect  the  repeal  of  such
 subdivision and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
