 RESTRICTIVE  COVENANT  AS  A  CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT OR WITH RESPECT TO
 SEVERANCE PAY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT  SHALL
 BE ENFORCEABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT MEETS THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:
  A.  (I)  WHERE THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IS A CONDITION TO COMMENCEMENT
 OF EMPLOYMENT, THE EMPLOYER SHALL DISCLOSE THE TERMS AND  CONDITIONS  OF

 LY  STATE  THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL PRIOR

 OR CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE COVENANT.
  E.  THE  AGREEMENT  SHALL  NOT  CONTAIN A CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION THAT

 DIATELY PRECEDING THE TERMINATION OF SUCH EMPLOYMENT.
  F. THE AGREEMENT SHALL NOT WAIVE AN EMPLOYEE'S SUBSTANTIVE, PROCEDURAL

 RULE OR REGULATION, OR UNDER THE COMMON LAW.
  G. THE AGREEMENT SHALL NOT  RESTRICT  AN  EMPLOYEE  FROM  PROVIDING  A

 RIOUS TO THE PUBLIC, OR INCONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC POLICY.
  J.  THE  EMPLOYEE IS TERMINATED FOR GOOD CAUSE OR THE EMPLOYEE RESIGNS

 BE ENFORCEABLE IF AN EMPLOYER TERMINATES AN EMPLOYEE WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE.
  3.  EVERY EMPLOYER SHALL PROVIDE ITS EMPLOYEES WITH A WRITTEN DOCUMENT
 REGARDING SUCH EMPLOYER'S POLICY ON GOOD CAUSE WITH  RESPECT  TO  TERMI-
 NATION.

 VIOLATION.

 UNDER SECTION TWO HUNDRED TWO-K OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have  become  a  law  and  shall  apply to agreements entered into on or
 before such date.
