  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the
  Adirondack Balloon Festival
 
  WHEREAS, Fairs and festivals  empower  communities  to  attract  new
visitors while capitalizing on local commercial and cultural value; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
support events of significance which contribute to the entertainment and
vitality of the communities they serve, and which exemplify the  history
and development of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  early 1970s Warren County's tourism and publicity
office was looking for an idea for an event which would  bring  visitors
to  the  region after Labor Day; at that time, there were relatively few
hot air balloons in the nation; one such balloonist, John  Marsden  from
Manchester,  Vermont,  shared  photos of his balloon with some visionary
Glens  Falls  residents,  which  included  Walter  Grishkot,  and  the
Adirondack Balloon Festival was born shortly thereafter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  early  days  of  the Festival were held at Adirondack
Community College, now known as SUNY Adirondack; as the  event  grew,  a
larger site was needed to accommodate the growing number of balloons and
spectators;  that  new  site  was  the Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport in
Queensbury, New York, where it continues to be held today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, this not-for-profit  organization  has
never charged the public to witness this magnificent site; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the  years,  the event has drawn international
exposure for the Glens Falls region with relationships being formed with
cities like Saga, Japan and Gatineau, Quebec;  the  event  traditionally
draws balloonists from across the United States but also internationally
based pilots; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  its  humble  beginnings,  the  event currently draws
upwards of 100,000 people over four days; the Festival  has  been  named
one  of  the  Top 100 events in North America and has received accolades
from the Weather Channel, Food  Network  and  media  coverage  including
numerous Associated Press articles as well as New York Times, Amtrak and
Southwest Airlines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the  death  of  founder  Walter Grishkot in 2011, a
foundation was set up in his memory to raise funds to  promote  interest
in education in the sciences of aviation and aerospace; in the summer of
2021,  his  wife  Joan also passed away, leaving a hole in the hearts of
all those who diligently work each year to make the Festival a  success;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the Adirondack Balloon Festival continues to serve
as an extraordinary attraction, bringing thousands of people  each  year
to see what it has to offer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those organizations that have brought entertainment and cultural
enrichment to the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Adirondack Balloon Festival; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of  the  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Adirondack Balloon Festival.
