 Introduced  by  M.  of A. BICHOTTE HERMELYN -- read once and referred to
  the Committee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to  requiring  state  and
  local law enforcement officers to identify themselves to the public
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The  legis-
 lature  finds that the people of the state of New York are in great debt
 to the hard work and  dedication  of  police  officers  in  their  daily
 duties.  The  legislature further finds that mistrust of law enforcement
 officers based on real or perceived discrimination hinders law  enforce-
 ment efforts and is a threat to public safety.  New York state and local
 police policy already requires that officers wear shields and nameplates
 at  all  times while in uniform, and that they provide their rank, name,
 shield number and command when asked.
  In adopting this act, it is the intent of the legislature to  increase
 transparency in police practices and to build trust between police offi-
 cers  and  members  of the public by providing the public with notice of
 the reasons behind their encounters  with  the  police,  and  a  written
 record  of  their interactions with the police in situations that do not
 result in an arrest or summons.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new section 236 to  read
 as follows:
  §  236. IDENTIFICATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. 1. AS USED IN THIS
 ARTICLE THE FOLLOWING WORDS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A) "LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY" SHALL MEAN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING  ACTIV-
 ITIES WHEN CONDUCTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS:
  (I) NONCUSTODIAL QUESTIONING OF INDIVIDUALS;
  (II) PEDESTRIAN STOPS;
  (III) FRISKS;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 ENFORCEMENT  OFFICER IS NOT IN UNIFORM AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE OFFICER

 remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,
