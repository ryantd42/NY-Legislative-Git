 or when a defendant is convicted of the crime of criminal use of a chem-
 ical  weapon  or  biological  weapon  in  the first degree as defined in
 section 490.55 of this chapter, the court shall sentence  the  defendant
 to  life imprisonment without parole in accordance with subdivision five
 of section 70.00 of this title; provided, however, that nothing in  this
 section shall preclude or prevent a sentence of death when the defendant
 is  also  convicted  of murder in the first degree as defined in section
 125.27 of this chapter. When a  defendant  is  convicted  of  aggravated
 murder  as defined in subdivision two of section 125.26 of this chapter,

  §  2.  Subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 and subdivi-
 sion 5 of section 70.00 of the penal law, subparagraph (i) of  paragraph
 (a)  of  subdivision  3  as  amended by chapter 107 of the laws of 2006,
 subdivision 5 as amended by section 40-a of part WWW of  chapter  59  of
 the laws of 2017, are amended to read as follows:
  (i) For a class A-I felony, such minimum period shall not be less than
 fifteen  years  nor more than twenty-five years; provided, however, that
 (A) where a [sentence, other than a sentence of death or life  imprison-
 ment without parole, is imposed upon a] defendant convicted of murder in
 the  first  degree  as  defined  in  section 125.27 of this chapter such
 [minimum period shall be not less than twenty years nor more than  twen-
 ty-five  years] SENTENCE SHALL BE LIFE IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT PAROLE, and,

 125.26  of this chapter, the sentence shall be life imprisonment without
 parole, and, (C) where a sentence is imposed upon a defendant  convicted
 of  attempted  murder  in  the  first  degree  as defined in article one
 hundred ten of this chapter and subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of para-
 graph (a) of subdivision one and paragraph (b)  of  subdivision  one  of

  5.  Life  imprisonment  without  parole.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of  law,  a  defendant sentenced to life imprisonment without
 parole shall not  be  or  become  eligible  for  parole  or  conditional
 release.  For  purposes of commitment and custody, other than parole and
 conditional release, such sentence shall be deemed to be  an  indetermi-
 nate sentence. A defendant [may] SHALL be sentenced to life imprisonment
 without  parole  upon  conviction  for  the crime of murder in the first
 degree as defined in section 125.27 of this chapter  and  in  accordance
 with  the  procedures  provided  by law for imposing a sentence for such
 crime. A defendant who was eighteen years of age or older at the time of
 the commission of the crime must be sentenced to life imprisonment with-
 out parole upon conviction for the crime  of  terrorism  as  defined  in
 section  490.25 of this chapter, where the specified offense the defend-
 ant committed is a class A-I felony; the crime of criminal possession of
 A. 6885  3
 
 a chemical weapon or biological weapon in the first degree as defined in
 section 490.45 of this chapter; or the crime of criminal use of a chemi-
 cal weapon or biological weapon  in  the  first  degree  as  defined  in
 section  490.55 of this chapter; provided, however, that nothing in this
 subdivision shall preclude or prevent  a  sentence  of  death  when  the
 defendant  is  also convicted of the crime of murder in the first degree
 as defined in section 125.27 of this chapter. A defendant who was seven-
 teen years of age or younger at the time of the commission of the  crime
 may  be  sentenced, in accordance with law, to the applicable indetermi-
 nate sentence with a maximum term of life imprisonment. A defendant must
 be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole upon conviction for the
 crime of murder in the second degree as defined in subdivision  five  of
 section  125.25 of this chapter or for the crime of aggravated murder as
 defined in subdivision one of section 125.26 of this chapter. A  defend-
 ant may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole upon conviction
 for  the  crime  of  aggravated  murder as defined in subdivision two of
 section 125.26 of this chapter.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 400.27 of the criminal procedure law, as
 added by chapter 1 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  1. Upon the conviction of a defendant for the offense of murder in the
 first degree as defined by section 125.27 of the penal  law,  the  court
 shall  promptly  conduct  a  separate sentencing proceeding to determine
 whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or to  life  imprison-
 ment without parole pursuant to subdivision five of section 70.00 of the
 penal  law.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall be deemed to preclude the
 people at any time from determining that the death penalty shall not  be
 sought  in  a  particular  case,  in  which case the separate sentencing
 proceeding shall not be conducted and the  court  [may]  SHALL  sentence
 such  defendant to life imprisonment without parole [or to a sentence of
 imprisonment for the class A-I felony of  murder  in  the  first  degree
 other than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole].
  §  4.  Paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of subdivision 12 of section 400.27
 of the criminal procedure law, as added by chapter  1  of  the  laws  of
 1995, are amended to read as follows:
  (b)  In  the event the defendant is sentenced pursuant to this section
 to life imprisonment without parole [or to a term  of  imprisonment  for
 the class A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence
 of life imprisonment without parole], the court shall not render a find-
 ing  with respect to whether the defendant is [mentally retarded] INTEL-
 LECTUALLY DISABLED.
  (c) In the event the defendant is sentenced pursuant to  this  section
 to  death,  the  court  shall thereupon render a finding with respect to
 whether the defendant is [mentally retarded] INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. If
 the court finds the  defendant  is  [mentally  retarded]  INTELLECTUALLY
 DISABLED,  the  court shall set aside the sentence of death and sentence
 the defendant [either] to life imprisonment without parole [or to a term
 of imprisonment for the class A-I felony of murder in the  first  degree
 other than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole]. If the court
 finds  the defendant is not [mentally retarded] INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED,
 then such sentence of death shall not be  set  aside  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision.
  (e) The foregoing provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding, at a
 reasonable  time  prior  to the commencement of trial the defendant may,
 upon a written motion alleging reasonable cause to believe the defendant
 is mentally  retarded]  INTELLECTUALLY  DISABLED,  apply  for  an  order
 directing that a [mental retardation] INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY hearing be
 A. 6885  4
 
 conducted  prior to trial. If, upon review of the defendant's motion and
 any response thereto, the court finds reasonable cause  to  believe  the
 defendant  is  [mentally  retarded]  INTELLECTUALLY  DISABLED,  it shall
 promptly  conduct  a  hearing  without  a  jury to determine whether the
 defendant is [mentally retarded] INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. In  the  event
 the  court  finds  after the hearing that the defendant is not [mentally
 retarded] INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED, the court must, prior to commencement
 of trial, enter an order so stating, but nothing in this paragraph shall
 preclude a defendant from  presenting  mitigating  evidence  of  [mental
 retardation]  INTELLECTUAL  DISABILITY at a separate sentencing proceed-
 ing. In the event the court finds after the hearing that the  defendant,
 based  upon  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence, is [mentally retarded]
 INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED, the court must, prior to commencement of trial,
 enter an order so stating. Unless the order is reversed on an appeal  by
 the people or unless the provisions of paragraph (d) of this subdivision
 apply,  a separate sentencing proceeding under this section shall not be
 conducted if the defendant is thereafter  convicted  of  murder  in  the
 first  degree.  In  the  event  a  separate sentencing proceeding is not
 conducted, the court, upon conviction of a defendant for  the  crime  of
 murder  in the first degree, shall sentence the defendant to life impri-
 sonment without parole [or to a sentence of imprisonment for  the  class
 A-I  felony  of murder in the first degree other than a sentence of life
 imprisonment without parole].  Whenever a [mental retardation] INTELLEC-
 TUAL DISABILITY hearing is held and a finding is  rendered  pursuant  to
 this  paragraph,  the  court may not conduct a hearing pursuant to para-
 graph (a) of this subdivision. For  purposes  of  this  subdivision  and
 paragraph (b) of subdivision nine of this section,["mental retardation"]
 "INTELLECTUAL  DISABILITY" means significantly subaverage general intel-
 lectual functioning existing  concurrently  with  deficits  in  adaptive
 behavior which were manifested before the age of eighteen.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
