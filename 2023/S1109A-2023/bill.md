 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  general  business  law  and the banking law, in
  relation to prohibiting a consumer reporting  agency  or  lender  from
  using an individual's late payment of cashless tolls to determine such
  individual's credit worthiness
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraphs (vii) and (viii) of paragraph 1  of  subdivi-
 sion (f) of section 380-j of the general business law, as added by chap-
 ter 867 of the laws of 1977, are amended to read as follows:
  (vii) information relating to past confinement in a mental institution
 where  the  date  of  last confinement antedates the report by more than
 seven years; [or]
  (viii) LATE PAYMENTS OF ANY CASHLESS TOLLS AS A  FACTOR  TO  DETERMINE
 THE CONSUMER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS, CREDIT STANDING OR CREDIT CAPACITY; OR
  (IX)  any other adverse information which antedates the report by more
 than seven years.
  § 2. Section 352 of the banking law is amended by adding a  new  ninth
 undesignated paragraph to read as follows:
  NO LICENSEE SHALL COLLECT, EVALUATE, REPORT OR MAINTAIN IN THE FILE ON
 A  BORROWER THE BORROWER'S LATE PAYMENT OF CASHLESS TOLLS AS A FACTOR TO
 DETERMINE THE BORROWER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS, CREDIT  STANDING  OR  CREDIT
 CAPACITY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE ENFORCED CONCURRENT-
 LY  BY  THE  SUPERINTENDENT AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF CONSUMER
 PROTECTION AND EACH SHALL UTILIZE THEIR CONSUMER COMPLAINT  AND  ASSIST-
 ANCE HOTLINES TO DOCUMENT COMPLAINTS BY BORROWERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR
 LATE  PAYMENT  OF  CASHLESS TOLLS IS BEING USED TO DENY THEM CREDIT. THE
 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL ENSURE THAT THE CREDIT SCORING FORMULAS FILED  WITH
 THE  DEPARTMENT  DO NOT CONTAIN VARIABLES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR LATE PAYMENT
 OF CASHLESS TOLLS AS PART OF THAT FORMULA  BY  ASKING  THE  LICENSEE  TO
 CERTIFY TO THAT FACT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
