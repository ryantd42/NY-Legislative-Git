 spend  the  minimum amount necessary to comply with the minimum spending
 standards for resident-facing staffing or direct resident  care,  calcu-

  § 2. Joint labor-management nursing home staffing workgroup. Beginning
 no later than July 1, 2025, the commissioner shall convene an eight-mem-
 ber labor-management nursing home staffing workgroup that  shall  review
 and  assess the impact of the demonstration program. The workgroup shall
 consist of an equal number of nursing home operators and representatives
 of  organized  labor  who represent nursing home staff. The four nursing
 home operator appointees shall consist of a proportionate representation
 of operators, including: (i) both for-profit and  not-for-profit  opera-
 tors;  and  (ii) appointees from various regions of the state. In making
 such nursing home operator appointments,  the  commissioner  shall  seek
 recommendations  from  regional  or  statewide associations representing
 predominantly for-profit and not-for-profit nursing home operators.  The
 commissioner  and  a  representative  of  the  office  of long-term care
 ombudsman shall also be members of the workgroup as ex-officio, non-vot-
 ing members.
  The workgroup shall study, evaluate,  and  make  recommendations  with
 respect  to  the  demonstration  program,  including  whether  or not to
 continue or modify the program. The workgroup shall also assess at least
 the following issues: (i) the impact of  the  demonstration  program  on
 reducing the use of staffing agencies; (ii) the impact of reduced staff-
 ing agencies on continued staffing shortages and meeting required staff-
 ing  levels  in  various  regions  of the state; and (iii) the impact of
 reduced staffing agency employees on quality of care  and  nursing  home
 operations.  In conducting its duties the workgroup shall solicit input
 and recommendations from representatives of consumers, and persons  with
 experience in nursing home data.
  The  workgroup  shall  prepare  a  report reflecting a majority of the
 voting members' recommendations no later than October 1, 2026.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
