  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2023, as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  dedicated  to  raising awareness of serious conditions
impacting the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  October  2023,  as  Spina
Bifida Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Spina Bifida Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spina  bifida,  which occurs when the spinal column of the
baby fails to form or close properly in the  first  month  of  pregnancy
resulting in damage to the spinal column, is the most common permanently
disabling  birth  defect  compatible  with life in the United States; an
average of eight babies every day  are  born  with  spina  bifida  or  a
similar defect of the brain and spine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spina  bifida happens when the spinal column and brain, or
neural tube, is formed; the openings, or lesions, in the  spinal  column
end  up causing damage in the spinal column and result in some degree of
paralysis; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many New Yorkers living  with  spina  bifida  for
whom  health  and  support services are critical to their well-being and
improving their quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children born with spina bifida have  medical  expenditures
that  are  13 times higher than those of the average child without spina
bifida; adults with spina bifida have average medical expenditures  that
are  three  to  six  times  greater  than  those of adults without spina
bifida; and
 
  WHEREAS, The average total lifetime cost to society for many infants
born with spina bifida may well exceed one million dollars; and
 
  WHEREAS, Studies have shown that taking  folic  acid  decreases  the
risk for neural tube defects during pregnancy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Folic  acid  education can help women of child-bearing age
understand the benefits of taking a daily  multivitamin  to  reduce  the
risk  of  neural  tube  defects;  experts  recommend  all  women  of
child-bearing age in the United States consume 400 micrograms  of  folic
acid per day; and
 
  WHEREAS, The prevalence of spina bifida among children from birth to
11  years  of  age  declined  by 1.4% annually from 1991 to 2002, with a
consistent reduction each year due to folic acid  fortification  of  the
food supply; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize Spina
Bifida  Awareness  Month  in  the  State of New York, to raise awareness
regarding the challenges of living with spina bifida;  it  is  the  hope
that  this  month  of  awareness  will  also remind all New Yorkers that
people  with  spina  bifida are not defined by their condition, they are
people with careers, families, and children, just like  so  many  people
without spina bifida; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  October  2023,  as  Spina
Bifida Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the Spina Bifida Association of Northeastern New York.
