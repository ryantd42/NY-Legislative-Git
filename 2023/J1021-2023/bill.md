  HONORING  Firefighter  Angelo  J.  Sposta upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years of dedicated service to Fire Patrol
  and Rescue Co. 1 of the Port Chester Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Angelo  J.  Sposta  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of  dedicated  service  to  Fire  Patrol  and
Rescue  Co.  1 of the Port Chester Fire Department to be celebrated at a
party held in his honor on Saturday, June 3, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Angelo J. Sposta joined Fire Patrol and  Rescue  Co.  1  on
March  6,  1973;  throughout  his  50  years of service, he held several
positions within the Department including: Captain from March  6,  1979,
to  March  3,  1981,  and  several  terms  as  both  Vice  President and
President; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1990, Angelo J. Sposta  was  hired  as  a  Port  Chester
Career  Firefighter,  the  position  from which he officially retired in
2014; and
 
  WHEREAS, With him throughout has been his wife, Kathleen, and  their
three  children,  Angelo, Andrew, and Moira, all of whom feel privileged
to be a part of his life and rejoice in his achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Angelo J. Sposta is one such firefighter; throughout 50 years of devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Angelo J. Sposta upon the occasion of his  designation
for  special  recognition  after  50  years of dedicated service to Fire
 
Patrol and Rescue Co. 1 of the Port Chester Fire Department; and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Angelo J. Sposta.
