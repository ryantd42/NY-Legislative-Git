 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Congregation RSK to  receive  retroac-
  tive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Rockland is hereby  authorized  to  accept
 from  Congregation  RSK  an application for exemption from real property
 taxes pursuant to section 420-a  of  the  real  property  tax  law  with
 respect to the 2021-2022 assessment rolls with such parcel being located
 at  68  Highview Road, in the hamlet of Monsey, town of Ramapo otherwise
 known as Rockland county tax map section 56.06,  block  1,  lot  15.  If
 accepted,  the  application shall be reviewed as if it had been received
 on or before the taxable status dates established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the  Rockland  county  legislature,
 may  grant  exemption from all taxation and make appropriate corrections
 to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organization
 therefore shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the
 governing body or tax department may, in its  sole  discretion,  provide
 for  the  refund of those taxes paid and cancel any taxes, fines, penal-
 ties, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
