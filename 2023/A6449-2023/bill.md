 ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYER AS IS APPROPRIATE TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  3. A PUBLIC EMPLOYER SHALL CONTRIBUTE THREE PERCENT OF  SUCH  AFFECTED
 EMPLOYEE'S  ANNUAL  SALARY  TOWARDS  SUCH DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. ALL
 NON-CIVIL SERVICE APPOINTED EMPLOYEES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE REQUIRED
 TO CONTRIBUTE THREE PERCENT OF THEIR SALARY TOWARDS THE DEFINED CONTRIB-
 UTION PLAN.  SUCH EMPLOYEES MAY CONTRIBUTE UP TO  ONE  HUNDRED  PERCENT,

 OF THIS SECTION. NON-CIVIL SERVICE APPOINTED EMPLOYEES AND ELECTED OFFI-
 CIALS SHALL NO LONGER  CONTRIBUTE  TO  THEIR  CURRENT  RETIREMENT  PLAN,
 HOWEVER, SUCH PERSONS SHALL RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE ACCRUED UP TO
 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION UPON RETIREMENT.  THE MEMBERSHIP OF A
 NON-CIVIL  SERVICE  APPOINTED  EMPLOYEE OR ELECTED OFFICIAL IN ANY STATE
 RETIREMENT SYSTEM SHALL REMAIN OPEN IF HE OR SHE BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE
 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of the fiscal  year  next
 succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law. Effective imme-
 diately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation
 necessary  for  the implementation of this act on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would change the retirement plan coverage for certain exist-
 ing and future elected officials and non-civil  service  appointees  who
 are  employed  by  the  State  of  New York or any public employer which
 participates in the New  York  State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  (NYSLERS).  Affected  employees  and  their  employers  would be
 REQUIRED to contribute 3% of annual compensation to a  defined  contrib-
 ution plan. The Comptroller shall select one or more financial organiza-
 tions  to  administer  the plan and to invest the funds held pursuant to
 such plan.  Pursuant to Chapter 18 of the Laws of 2012, participation is
 currently OPTIONAL in a defined contribution plan for non-union  employ-
 ees hired on or after July 1, 2013 whose salary is $75,000 or higher.
 A. 6449  3

  This legislation would freeze the benefit accruals of current affected
 members  in  the  NYSLERS as of the effective date. If enacted into law,
 this bill is likely to face a constitutional challenge  based  upon  the
 guarantee that a member's benefits may not be diminished.
  In addition, if enacted there will be an administrative cost to imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
