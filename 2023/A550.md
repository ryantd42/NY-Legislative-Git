 Introduced  by  M.  of A. BICHOTTE HERMELYN -- read once and referred to

 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation  to  designating  January
  sixth as "Democracy Day"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative findings. The Legislature finds  and  declares
 the following:
  1. On Wednesday, January 6th, 2021, the President of the United States
 at  the  time, Donald J. Trump, members of his administration and presi-
 dential campaign, and several Republican Members of  Congress,  directly
 incited  and  encouraged  an  armed and violent insurrection against the
 government of the United States, with the express purpose of  preventing
 the peaceful transfer of power and overturning the results of a free and
 fair election.
  2.  In  the  months  leading  up to January 6th, the former President,
 members of his administration,  and  numerous  elected  members  of  his
 party,  intentionally spread false and inflammatory claims regarding the
 legitimacy of the election, and both implicitly and explicitly  promised
 violent or armed opposition to prevent the election from being certified
 and the President-Elect from taking office.
  3.  In  the course of their attack, the insurrectionists trespassed on
 and destroyed Federal property, including flagrantly looting  the  Capi-
 tol,  and  openly  bragged  about  their  exploits  on social media. The
 attackers carried white supremacist symbols including the flag known  as
 the  "Confederate  battle  flag,"  as well as anti-Semitic, fascist, and
 neo-nazi ideology. At the same time as many were carrying these  symbols
 of the enemies of the United States, some of the attackers were observed
 removing  the  flag of the United States, throwing it to the ground, and
 replacing it with a flag bearing the name of President Donald J. Trump.
  4. One hundred thirty-eight police officers were injured defending the
 Capitol, and four insurrectionists and a Capitol Police officer died. In
 the months that followed the  attack,  four  additional  Capitol  Police
 officers  died  by  suicide.  More  than  seven hundred people have been

 arrested in connection with the attack, however those  most  responsible
 have avoided accountability.
  5.  It  is the intent of the legislature to establish an annual day of
 commemoration to be known as Democracy Day,  to  honor  those  who  were
 wounded or died as a result of defending the Capitol, reiterate the need
 to protect and strengthen our democratic institutions, and recognize the
 ongoing  threat of anti-democratic, white nationalist, and authoritarian
 movements in the United States.
