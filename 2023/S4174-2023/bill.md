 of  section  50  of  the  internal revenue code, a portion of the credit
 allowed under this subsection must be added back  in  the  same  taxable
 year and in the same proportion as the federal recapture.

 shall  be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
 accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
 article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
  (5) Except in the case  of  (A)  a  qualified  rehabilitation  project
