 ANY OTHER RIGHTS THE SUBSCRIBER MAY HAVE RELATED TO AN  ELECTRIC  CORPO-
 RATION'S  PROVISION OF ELECTRIC SERVICE OR OTHER MATTERS AS PROVIDED BY,
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TARIFF, DECISION OF THE COMMISSION, OR STATUTE.
  (D) THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS MAY APPLY TO A  SHARED  RENEWABLE  ENERGY
 FACILITY  THAT  HAS A RATED CAPACITY OF NOT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND KILO-

 A. 3266  4
 
 MINED BY A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THROUGH A PROCEEDING TO BE ESTABLISHED BY
 THE COMMISSION:

 THE APPROPRIATE METHOD OF ALLOCATING THOSE COSTS.
  5. CALCULATION OF BILL CREDITS. (A) FOR SUBSCRIBERS TO A SHARED RENEW-
 ABLE ENERGY FACILITY THAT ARE LOCATED ON THE SAME DISTRIBUTION FEEDER AS
 THE SHARED RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITY, THE VALUE OF THE BILL CREDIT SHALL
 BE  CALCULATED  BY MULTIPLYING THE SUBSCRIBER'S PORTION OF THE KILOWATT-
 HOUR ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION FROM THE SHARED RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITY BY
 THE RETAIL RATE AS CHARGED TO THE  SUBSCRIBER  BY  THE  ELECTRIC  CORPO-
 RATION;
  (B)  THE  COMMISSION,  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  NEW  YORK  STATE ENERGY
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, MAY REVISE THE  BILL  CREDIT  CALCU-
 LATION METHODOLOGY AT ANY TIME THAT IT CONCLUDES THAT THE EXISTING METH-
 ODOLOGY  DOES NOT PROVIDE SUBSCRIBERS WITH THE FAIR VALUE OF ELECTRICITY
 AND OTHER BENEFITS PRODUCED BY SHARED RENEWABLE  ENERGY  FACILITIES  AND
 THAT  SUCH  A  REVISION  IS  IN  THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AS DETERMINED BY A
 STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THROUGH  A  PROCEEDING  TO  BE  ESTABLISHED  BY  THE
 COMMISSION.  ANY  REVISION  TO  THE  BILL CREDIT CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
 SHALL APPLY TO NEW SHARED  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  FACILITIES  INTERCONNECTED
 AFTER THE COMMISSION ADOPTS A NEW METHODOLOGY. 
  6.  CONDITIONS  OF  SERVICE. (A) AN ELECTRIC CORPORATION SHALL PROVIDE

 SERVICE  LINE  AND APPURTENANT FACILITIES THAT EXCEEDS THE PORTION WHICH
 THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION IS REQUIRED TO  PROVIDE  WITHOUT  CONTRIBUTION,
 WHICH  COSTS  SHALL BE DEFINED IN THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S TARIFF, AND

 REQUIREMENTS  OF  THIS  SECTION.  THE COMMISSION SHALL RENDER A DECISION
 WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE SCHEDULE IS FILED.
  (C) IN THE EVENT THAT THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION DETERMINES THAT  IT  IS
 NECESSARY  TO  INSTALL A DEDICATED TRANSFORMER OR TRANSFORMERS, OR OTHER
 EQUIPMENT TO  PROTECT  THE  SAFETY  AND  ADEQUACY  OF  ELECTRIC  SERVICE
