 AN  ACT  in  relation to authorizing the Jamesport Fire District to file
  an application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the  town  of  Riverhead, county  of  Suffolk,  is here-
 by authorized to accept from the Jamesport Fire District, an application
 for  exemption  from  real property taxes pursuant to section 464 of the
 real  property tax law with respect  to  the  2021-2022  and  2022-2023
 assessment  rolls, for  the  parcels  owned  by such organization, with
 such parcels being located at 41 Manor Lane, in the  village  of  James-
 port, town of Riverhead, county of Suffolk, otherwise known  as  Suffolk
 county  tax  map  district  0600, section  068.00,  block 02.00, lot
 010.006.
  If accepted, the application shall be  reviewed  as  if  it  had  been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If  satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption if such organization had filed an application for exemption by
 the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval by  the
 town  of  Riverhead  board, may grant exemption from  all  taxation  and
 make  appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such exemption is
 granted and such organization therefore shall have  paid  any  tax  with
 respect  to  the  subject  roll,  the applicable governing body or tax
 department  may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  the
 taxes  paid, along  with  any  fines  or penalties paid, and cancel any
 taxes, fines,  penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
