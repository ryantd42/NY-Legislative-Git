 Introduced  by  Sen.  WEIK  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT relating to publishing data on the effects of bail reform
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  timing  of the recent surge in
 shootings and violent  crime  corresponds  with  the  implementation  of
 changes to the bail laws passed by the majorities in the legislature and
 signed  by the governor as part of the 2019-2020 State Budget. Since the
 start of 2020, shootings, murders, assaults  and  other  violent  crimes
 have  dramatically increased all across the state. Shootings in New York
 City increased nearly one hundred percent from 2019  to  2020  and  this
 year  shootings  are up another fifty percent through July. Shootings in
 the metropolitan areas across the state outside of New York City were up
 seventy-five percent from 2019 to 2020  and  another  forty-one  percent
 this year through July.
  It is imperative that the state fully understands the ramifications of
 the  changes  to the bail reform act.  The data collected by this legis-
 lation will help with that endeavor.
  § 2. The Office of Court Administration in collaboration with the  New
 York  State  Division of Criminal Justice Services shall collect data on
 the following information:
  (a) The number of individuals that were charged with  crimes  that  no
 longer qualify for bail, and a breakdown of those charges;
  (b)  The  number  of  individuals  released  pending trial because the
 offense no longer qualifies for bail and then re-offended while awaiting
 trial; and
  (c) The types of crimes committed by re-offenders awaiting trial.
  The data shall be published on the Office  of  Court  Administration's
 website  and  the  New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services'
 website in a searchable format.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 data,  required to be collected and published pursuant to section two of
 this act, shall be published within thirty days of the effective date of
 this act.
