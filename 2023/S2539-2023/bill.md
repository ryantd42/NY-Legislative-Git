 AN ACT relating to the  Long  Island  Rail  Road  weekend  reduced  fare

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative findings. The New York state  legislature  has
 found  that  on  the weekends the Long Island Rail Road, a subsidiary of
 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, provides reduced fare between
 the hours of 12:01 AM Saturday until 11:59 AM Sunday at certain  station
 locations.  Passengers  traveling  to and from locations within New York
 city should not forfeit their enjoyment of  such  reduced  fare  because
 their train happens to pass through Nassau county.
  §  2.  Definitions. The term "fare" shall mean a person or persons who
 tender money to participate in the transportation services  provided  by
 the Long Island Rail Road.
  §  3.  It  shall  be unlawful for the Long Island Rail Road to exclude
 from its weekend reduced fare programs individuals traveling  from  East
 New  York  station  to another location within New York city and to East
 New York station from another location within New York city.
  § 4. All trips included in such weekend  reduced  fare  program  shall
 receive the same reduced fare regardless of starting and ending points.
  §  5. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date upon which it shall have become a law.
