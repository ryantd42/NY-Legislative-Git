 Introduced  by  Sens.  PARKER,  KAVANAGH,  SEPULVEDA  --  read twice and
  ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on
  Finance
 
 AN  ACT to amend the education law, in relation to directing the commis-
  sioner of education to  establish  an  incentive  program  for  school
  districts  wishing  to  implement  programs of foreign language in the
  elementary schools and directing  the  commissioner  of  education  to
  establish  an incentive program for college students wishing to become
  foreign language teachers; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The education law is amended by adding a new section 817 to
 read as follows:
  §  817. FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM. 1. LEGISLA-
 TIVE INTENT. THE STUDENTS OF NEW YORK STATE NEED TO HAVE  SKILLS  IN  AT
 LEAST ONE LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH (LOTE) AND UNDERSTANDING OF ANOTH-
 ER CULTURE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF THE WORLD
 OF  TODAY AND TOMORROW. THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY;
 WORK WITH PEOPLE OF DIVERSE CULTURES ABROAD AND AT HOME, AND ENSURE  OUR
 NATIONAL SECURITY.
  ONE  GOAL  OF  THIS  SECTION  IS  TO  PROVIDE FUNDING TO START FOREIGN
 LANGUAGE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (FLES) PROGRAMS FOR A  LIMITED  NUMBER
 OF  SCHOOLS  IN  HIGH-NEED DISTRICTS.  PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM IS
 VOLUNTARY. RELATIVELY FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS OFFER FLES NATION-WIDE,  ONLY
 SIX  PERCENT  OF  STUDENTS  STUDY FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
 THESE DISTRICTS TEND TO BE AMONG THE MORE  AFFLUENT.  BY  CHOOSING  FIVE
 SCHOOLS  IN  HIGH-NEED  DISTRICTS,  WE  HOPE  TO  DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE
 SCHOOLS WHO CANNOT OTHERWISE AFFORD TO HAVE FLES PROGRAMS  CAN  SUCCEED.
 CHILDREN  OF  LOW-INCOME DISTRICTS DESERVE TO HAVE THE SKILLS TO SUCCEED
 IN THE GLOBAL WORLD AS WELL AS THOSE OF MORE AFFLUENT AREAS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6768  2
 
  ACCORDING TO RESEARCH AND THE GUIDELINES OF THE  AMERICAN  COUNCIL  ON
 THE  TEACHING  OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES (ACTFL), STUDENTS WHO BEGIN STUDY OF
 LOTE AT AN EARLY AGE AND WHO CONTINUE THAT STUDY FOR A LONG SEQUENCE  OF
 YEARS  HAVE  THE  BEST  CHANCES OF ATTAINING INTERMEDIATE PROFICIENCY IN
 THAT LANGUAGE.
  IT IS HOPED THAT THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS, WHICH WILL BE CAREFUL-
 LY  MONITORED  BY  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE ASSOCIATION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE
 TEACHERS (NYSAFLT), WILL NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE THE DISTRICTS  TO  FIND  THE
 FUNDS  TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE FLES PROGRAMS ONCE FUNDING FROM THE BILL
 HAS ENDED, BUT ALSO WILL GENERATE INTEREST IN THE NEIGHBORING  DISTRICTS
 WHICH  WILL  INSPIRE  THEM  TO  IMPLEMENT FLES PROGRAMS, THUS CREATING A
 GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT IN FAVOR OF FLES.
  THE SECOND GOAL OF THIS SECTION IS TO  PROVIDE  FUNDING  TO  ENCOURAGE
 COLLEGE  STUDENTS  WISHING  TO BECOME LOTE TEACHERS.  THERE IS A CURRENT
 SEVERE SHORTAGE OF LOTE TEACHERS IN NEW YORK STATE.  THIS  SHORTAGE  CAN
 PREVENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM OFFERING A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES AS WELL AS
 FROM ADDING CLASSES WITH THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING LOTE STUDY. THE FUND-
 ING PROVIDED WOULD COVER THE COST OF TUITION FOR EDUCATION COURSES LEAD-
 ING TO CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHING LOTE IN NEW YORK STATE.
  2.  FOREIGN  LANGUAGE  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (FLES) PILOT PROGRAM. PARTIC-
 IPATION IN THIS PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION  OF
 LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY, PURSUANT TO RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY
 THE COMMISSIONER, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A  TWO  YEAR  FOREIGN
 LANGUAGE  ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL  (FLES)  PILOT  PROGRAM  IN FIVE ELEMENTARY
 SCHOOLS LOCATED IN HIGH-NEED DISTRICTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT  WITH  MODELS
 PROVIDED  BY  THE ELEMENTARY FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OF THE
 NEW YORK STATE ASSOCIATION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHERS.
  (A) THE LANGUAGE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM SHALL:
  (1) CONSIST OF AT LEAST THREE TO FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK;
  (2) BE IN DURATION OF AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES PER SESSION  FOR  GRADES
 KINDERGARTEN  THROUGH  SECOND  AND THIRTY MINUTES IN DURATION FOR GRADES
 THREE THROUGH SIX; AND
  (3) ATTEMPT TO UTILIZE FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL  CERTIFIED
 TEACHERS AND TO REQUIRE ONGOING AND AGE-APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENTS.
  (B)  THE CURRICULUM SHOULD BE CONTENT COORDINATED WITH OVERALL COORDI-
 NATION WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROGRAM.
  (C) FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM SHALL BE PROVIDED TO:
  (1) HIRE FOREIGN LANGUAGE ELEMENTARY CERTIFIED TEACHERS;
  (2) PURCHASE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS; AND
  (3) INCORPORATE OTHER FORMS OF SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THE  PROGRAM  IS
 SUSTAINABLE AND SUCCESSFUL.
  3.  STUDENT  INCENTIVE AWARD FOR CERTIFICATION IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN
 ENGLISH (LOTE) TEACHING. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION  OF  LAW  TO  THE
 CONTRARY,  PURSUANT  TO REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE COMMISSIONER, THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A STUDENT INCENTIVE  AWARD  FOR  ATTRACTING
 AND  RETAINING  COLLEGE STUDENTS WISHING TO BECOME TEACHERS OF LANGUAGES
 OTHER THAN ENGLISH.
  (A) THESE INCENTIVES SHOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR  TUITION  IN  EDUCATION
 COURSES, UNDERGRADUATE OR GRADUATE, LEADING TO CERTIFICATION IN NEW YORK
 STATE.
  (B)  A PROVISION OF SUCH TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD BE A COMMITMENT ON
 THE PART OF THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHER TO TEACH FOREIGN  LANGUAGES  IN  NEW
 YORK  STATE  FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS AFTER GRADUATION. SUCH PROGRAM
 SHALL INCLUDE AN INCENTIVE AWARD OF TEN  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  PER  STUDENT
 UPON  THE  COMPLETION  OF COURSES FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENT FOR CERTIF-
 S. 6768  3
 
 ICATION IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH  (LOTE)  TEACHING  IN  NEW  YORK
 STATE.

 chair of the assembly ways and means committee.
  § 3. This act shall  take  effect  on  the  first  of  September  next
 succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.
