 AND PROVIDED THAT SAFETY IS PROTECTED, (A) THE LEGALIZATION OF SPECIFIED
 INHABITED BASEMENTS AND CELLARS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE
 OF THIS ARTICLE THROUGH CONVERSION TO LEGAL DWELLING UNITS, OR  (B)  THE
 CONVERSION  OF  OTHER SPECIFIED BASEMENTS AND CELLARS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR
 TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE TO LEGAL DWELLING UNITS. THE LOCAL
 LAW AUTHORIZED BY THIS SECTION, AND ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS PROMULGATED
 THEREUNDER, SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.
  2. THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY SUCH LOCAL LAW MAY PROVIDE TO  AN  OWNER
 WHO  CONVERTS AN INHABITED BASEMENT OR CELLAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A LOCAL
 LAW AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE OR WHO OTHERWISE ABATES THE ILLEGAL OCCU-
 PANCY OF A BASEMENT OR CELLAR AMNESTY FROM PROSECUTION,  AS  APPLICABLE,
 FOR  VIOLATIONS  OF THIS CHAPTER OR OTHER STATE LAW OR LOCAL LAW, RULES,
 AND THE ZONING RESOLUTION OF SUCH CITY, AND RESOLUTION OF ANY  OUTSTAND-
 ING  JUDGMENTS  ISSUED  IN  CONNECTION  WITH ANY VIOLATION OF SUCH LAWS,
 RULES OR ZONING RESOLUTION ISSUED BEFORE  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE.
  3.  SUCH  LOCAL  LAW MAY PROVIDE THAT ANY PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER OR
 ANY OTHER STATE LAW OR LOCAL LAW,  RULE  OR  REGULATION,  SHALL  NOT  BE
 APPLICABLE,  AS  NECESSARY, TO PROVIDE FOR THE ALTERATIONS NECESSARY FOR
 THE CONVERSION OF A SPECIFIED INHABITED  BASEMENT  OR  CELLAR  OR  OTHER
 SPECIFIED  BASEMENT OR CELLAR INTO A LAWFUL DWELLING UNIT. ANY AMENDMENT
 OF THE ZONING RESOLUTION  NECESSARY  TO  ENACT  SUCH  PROGRAM  SHALL  BE
 SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION OF SUCH LOCALITY,
 AND  APPROVAL  BY SUCH COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF SUCH LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT, BUT SHALL NOT REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OR ANY ADDITIONAL
 LAND USE REVIEW.
  § 290. TENANT PROTECTIONS IN INHABITED BASEMENTS OR CELLARS.  1.  THE
 PROGRAM  AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE SHALL REQUIRE AN APPLICATION TO MAKE
 ALTERATIONS TO LEGALIZE AN INHABITED BASEMENT OR CELLAR  BE  ACCOMPANIED
 BY  A  CERTIFICATION INDICATING WHETHER SUCH UNIT WAS RENTED TO A TENANT
 ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE, NOTWITHSTANDING WHETHER THE OCCU-
 PANCY OF SUCH UNIT WAS AUTHORIZED BY  LAW.  A  CITY  MAY  NOT  USE  SUCH
 CERTIFICATION  AS  THE BASIS FOR AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION FOR ILLEGAL OCCU-
 PANCY OF SUCH UNIT, PROVIDED THAT  NOTHING  CONTAINED  IN  THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO LIMIT SUCH CITY FROM ISSUING A VACATE ORDER FOR
 HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS, WHEN APPROPRIATE.
  2. THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY  THIS  ARTICLE  SHALL  PROVIDE  THAT  A
 TENANT  IN  OCCUPANCY AT THE TIME OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE,
 WHO IS EVICTED OR OTHERWISE REMOVED FROM SUCH UNIT AS  A  RESULT  OF  AN
 ALTERATION  NECESSARY  TO  BRING  AN  INHABITED  BASEMENT OR CELLAR INTO
 COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY
 THIS ARTICLE, SHALL HAVE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO RETURN TO SUCH UNIT
 AS A TENANT UPON ITS FIRST LAWFUL OCCUPANCY AS A  LEGAL  DWELLING  UNIT,
 NOTWITHSTANDING  WHETHER THE OCCUPANCY AT THE TIME OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE
 OF THIS ARTICLE WAS AUTHORIZED BY LAW. SUCH LOCAL LAW SHALL SPECIFY  HOW
 TO DETERMINE PRIORITY WHEN MULTIPLE TENANTS MAY CLAIM SUCH RIGHT.
  3.  A TENANT UNLAWFULLY DENIED A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO RETURN TO A
 LEGAL DWELLING UNIT, AS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY
 THIS ARTICLE, SHALL HAVE A CAUSE OF ACTION IN  ANY  COURT  OF  COMPETENT
 JURISDICTION  FOR  COMPENSATORY  DAMAGES  OR  DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
 RELIEF AS THE  COURT  DEEMS  NECESSARY  IN  THE  INTERESTS  OF  JUSTICE,
 PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH  COMPENSATORY  RELIEF  SHALL  NOT EXCEED THE ANNUAL
 RENTAL CHARGES FOR SUCH LEGAL DWELLING UNIT.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 472 of the private housing finance  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  479 of the laws of 2005, is amended to read as
 follows:
 S. 2276  3
 
  1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any  general,  special  or  local
 law,  a  municipality,  acting  through an agency, is authorized: (A) to
 make, or contract to make, loans to low and moderate income  owner-occu-
 pants  of one to four unit existing private or multiple dwellings within
 its  territorial  limits,  subject to the limitation of subdivisions two
 through seven of this section, in such amounts as shall be required  for
 the rehabilitation of such dwellings, provided, however, that such loans
 shall  not  exceed sixty thousand dollars per dwelling unit, EXCEPT THAT
 THE LIMITATION ON THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF A LOAN,  AS  DESCRIBED  IN  THIS
 PARAGRAPH,  SHALL  NOT  APPLY TO ANY SUCH LOAN FOR, IN WHOLE OR IN PART,
 REHABILITATION OF A SPECIFIED INHABITED  BASEMENT  OR  CELLAR  OR  OTHER
 SPECIFIED  BASEMENT  OR  CELLAR FOR WHICH SUCH OWNER HAS SOUGHT A PERMIT
 PURSUANT TO THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED
 EIGHTY-NINE  OF  THE  MULTIPLE DWELLING LAW. Such loans may also include
 the refinancing of the outstanding indebtedness of such  dwellings,  and
 the  municipality may make temporary loans or advances to such owner-oc-
 cupants in anticipation of permanent loans for such purposes; AND
  (B) TO MAKE OR CONTRACT TO MAKE GRANTS TO ANY OWNER DESCRIBED IN PARA-
 GRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, ON THE SAME TERMS AS PERMITTED UNDER SUCH
 PARAGRAPH FOR A LOAN.
  § 3. Section 472 of the private housing  finance  law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 1-a to read as follows:
  1-A.  AS USED IN THIS ARTICLE, THE TERM "LOAN" SHALL INCLUDE ANY GRANT
 MADE BY A MUNICIPALITY PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE CONCERNING THE REPAYMENT OR  FORGIVENESS  OF,
 OR  SECURITY  FOR,  A LOAN SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY GRANT MADE PURSUANT TO
 THIS ARTICLE.
  § 4. Subdivision 2 of section 473 of the private housing finance  law,
 as  added  by  chapter  786  of  the laws of 1987, is amended to read as
 follows:
  2. A municipality shall neither make nor participate in a loan  to  an
 owner-occupant  of  an existing private or multiple dwelling pursuant to
 this article unless the agency finds that the area in which such  dwell-
 ing is situated is a blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area or has
 a blighting influence on the surrounding area, or is in danger of becom-
 ing  a  slum or a blighted area because of the existence of substandard,
 unsanitary, deteriorating or deteriorated conditions,  an  aged  housing
 stock, or other factors indicating an inability of the private sector to
 cause such rehabilitation to be made, EXCEPT THAT ANY SUCH FINDING SHALL
 NOT  BE  REQUIRED  FOR ANY SUCH LOAN FOR, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REHABILI-
 TATION OF A SPECIFIED INHABITED BASEMENT OR CELLAR  OR  OTHER  SPECIFIED
 BASEMENT  OR CELLAR FOR WHICH SUCH OWNER HAS SOUGHT A PERMIT PURSUANT TO
 THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO SECTION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE  OF
 THE MULTIPLE DWELLING LAW.
