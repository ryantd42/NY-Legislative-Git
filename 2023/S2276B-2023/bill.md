  2. THE TERM "RENTED" MEANS LEASED, LET, OR HIRED OUT, WITH OR  WITHOUT
 A WRITTEN AGREEMENT; AND
  3. THE TERM "TENANT" MEANS AN INDIVIDUAL TO WHOM AN INHABITED BASEMENT
 OR CELLAR DWELLING UNIT IS RENTED.
  § 289. BASEMENT  AND  CELLAR  LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  1. NOTWITH-
 STANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF STATE OR LOCAL LAW TO THE CONTRARY, IN A
 CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR  MORE,  THE  LOCAL  LEGISLATIVE
 BODY  MAY,  BY LOCAL LAW, PROVIDED THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE PROTECTED,
 ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO ADDRESS (A) THE LEGALIZATION OF SPECIFIED  INHAB-
 ITED  BASEMENTS  AND CELLARS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
 THIS ARTICLE THROUGH CONVERSION TO LEGAL DWELLING  UNITS,  AND  (B)  THE
 CONVERSION  OF  OTHER SPECIFIED BASEMENTS AND CELLARS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR
 TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE TO LEGAL DWELLING UNITS. THE LOCAL
 LAW AUTHORIZED BY THIS SECTION, AND ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS PROMULGATED
 THEREUNDER, SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE EIGHT
 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW AND  ANY  STATE  AND  LOCAL  REGU-
 LATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER.
  2.  THE  PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY SUCH LOCAL LAW MAY PROVIDE TO AN OWNER
 WHO CONVERTS A BASEMENT OR CELLAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A LOCAL LAW AUTHOR-
 IZED BY THIS ARTICLE OR WHO OTHERWISE ABATES THE ILLEGAL OCCUPANCY OF  A
 BASEMENT  OR  CELLAR: (A) AMNESTY FROM PROSECUTION FOR ANY VIOLATIONS OF
 THIS CHAPTER, OTHER STATE LAW OR LOCAL LAW  OR  RULES,  AND  THE  ZONING
 RESOLUTION  OF  SUCH CITY RELATING TO THE PREMISES PRIOR TO SUCH CONVER-
 SION, AND (B) RELIEF FROM ANY  OUTSTANDING  CIVIL  JUDGMENTS  ISSUED  IN
 CONNECTION  WITH ANY SUCH VIOLATION OF SUCH LAWS, RULES OR ZONING RESOL-
 UTION ISSUED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE RELATING  TO  THE
 PREMISES  PRIOR  TO  SUCH CONVERSION; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH LOCAL
 LAW SHALL REQUIRE THAT SUCH AMNESTY OR RELIEF SHALL BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO
 AN OWNER THAT HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR A CONVERSION  BY  A  DATE
 CERTAIN SUBSEQUENT TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH LOCAL LAW AND THAT SUCH
 DATE  SHALL NOT BE LATER THAN TEN YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH
 LOCAL LAW.
  3. (A) SUCH LOCAL LAW MAY SUPERSEDE ANY PROVISION OF LOCAL LAW OR RULE
 TO FACILITATE THE CONVERSION OF A SPECIFIED INHABITED BASEMENT OR CELLAR
 OR OTHER SPECIFIED BASEMENT OR CELLAR IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO  THE  EFFEC-
 TIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE INTO A LAWFUL DWELLING UNIT.  FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF  THIS  PROGRAM, THE LOCAL LAW ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF SUCH
 MUNICIPALITY SHALL BE NO LESS STRINGENT THAN THE RELEVANT  STANDARDS  OR
 SPECIFICATIONS  OF  THE  UNIFORM  FIRE  PREVENTION AND BUILDING CODE AND
 STATE ENERGY CONSERVATION CONSTRUCTION CODE APPLICABLE TO THE CONVERSION
 OF BASEMENTS AND CELLARS TO HABITABLE DWELLING UNITS  IN  MUNICIPALITIES
 OTHER  THAN A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, UNLESS SUCH
 LEGISLATIVE BODY DETERMINES THAT THE APPLICATION OF  SUCH  STANDARDS  OR
 SPECIFICATIONS  WOULD  PRESENT  PRACTICAL  DIFFICULTIES  THAT IMPEDE THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE AND INCLUDES IN SUCH LOCAL LAW  AN  ALTERNATIVE
 STANDARD  OR  SPECIFICATION  THAT SUCH LEGISLATIVE BODY DETERMINES TO BE
 SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY.
  (B) SUCH LOCAL LAW MAY SUPERSEDE  THE  FOLLOWING  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 CHAPTER:  SECTIONS TWENTY-SIX, TWENTY-EIGHT, THIRTY, THIRTY-ONE, THIRTY-

 FIFTY,  FIFTY-A, FIFTY-ONE, FIFTY-TWO, FIFTY-FOUR, FIFTY-SIX, SIXTY-ONE,
 SIXTY-TWO, SIXTY-THREE, SIXTY-FOUR, SIXTY-FIVE, SIXTY-EIGHT, AND  SEVEN-
 TY-SIX, AND ARTICLES FOUR, FIVE AND SIX.
  (C)  ANY  AMENDMENT  OF  THE ZONING RESOLUTION NECESSARY TO ENACT SUCH
 PROGRAM SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE PLANNING  COMMISSION
 S. 2276--B  3
 
 OF  SUCH  LOCALITY,  AND APPROVAL BY SUCH COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATIVE
 BODY OF SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  IT  SHALL  NOT
 REQUIRE  ENVIRONMENTAL  REVIEW, INCLUDING, NOT LIMITED TO, ENVIRONMENTAL
 REVIEW  CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSER-
 VATION LAW AND ANY STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS  PROMULGATED  THEREUNDER,
 OR ANY ADDITIONAL LAND USE REVIEW.
  § 290. TENANT  PROTECTIONS IN INHABITED BASEMENTS AND CELLARS.  1. THE
 PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE SHALL REQUIRE AN APPLICATION TO  MAKE
 ALTERATIONS  TO  LEGALIZE AN INHABITED BASEMENT OR CELLAR BE ACCOMPANIED
 BY A CERTIFICATION INDICATING WHETHER SUCH UNIT WAS RENTED TO  A  TENANT
 ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE, NOTWITHSTANDING WHETHER THE OCCU-
 PANCY  OF SUCH UNIT WAS AUTHORIZED BY LAW. AN AGENCY OR OFFICE OF A CITY
 WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED MAY NOT USE SUCH CERTIFICATION AS
 THE BASIS FOR AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION FOR ILLEGAL OCCUPANCY OF SUCH  UNIT,
 PROVIDED  THAT  NOTHING  CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO
 LIMIT ANY AGENCY OR OFFICE FROM ISSUING A  VACATE  ORDER  FOR  HAZARDOUS
 CONDITIONS.
  2.  THE  LOCAL  LAW  AUTHORIZED  BY  THIS ARTICLE SHALL PROVIDE THAT A
 TENANT IN OCCUPANCY AT THE TIME OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE  OF  THIS  ARTICLE
 WHO  IS  EVICTED  OR  OTHERWISE REMOVED FROM SUCH UNIT AS A RESULT OF AN
 ALTERATION NECESSARY TO BRING  AN  INHABITED  BASEMENT  OR  CELLAR  INTO
 COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY
 THIS ARTICLE, SHALL HAVE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO RETURN TO SUCH UNIT
 AS  A  TENANT  UPON ITS FIRST LAWFUL OCCUPANCY AS A LEGAL DWELLING UNIT,
 NOTWITHSTANDING WHETHER THE OCCUPANCY AT THE TIME OF THE EFFECTIVE  DATE
 OF  THIS ARTICLE WAS AUTHORIZED BY LAW. SUCH LOCAL LAW SHALL SPECIFY HOW
 TO DETERMINE PRIORITY WHEN MULTIPLE TENANTS MAY CLAIM SUCH RIGHT.
  3. A TENANT UNLAWFULLY DENIED A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO RETURN TO  A
 LEGAL DWELLING UNIT, AS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY
 THIS  ARTICLE,  SHALL  HAVE  A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE OWNER OF SUCH
 DWELLING UNIT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT  JURISDICTION  FOR  COMPENSATORY
 DAMAGES  OR  DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS THE COURT DEEMS NECES-
 SARY IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH COMPENSATORY RELIEF
 SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ANNUAL RENTAL CHARGES FOR SUCH LEGAL DWELLING UNIT.
  4. NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOCAL EMERGENCY HOUSING  RENT  CONTROL  ACT  OF
 1962  AS AMENDED, THE LOCAL LAW AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE SHALL INCLUDE
 PROTECTIONS AGAINST EVICTION AND LIMITATIONS ON RENT INCREASES FOR BASE-
 MENT OR CELLAR DWELLING UNITS THAT UNDERGO LEGALIZATION, INCLUDING LIMI-
 TATIONS ON RENT INCREASES FOR TENANTS RETURNING TO SUCH  UNITS  PURSUANT
 TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
