  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023, as Gun Violence Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Gun Violence
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Gun Violence Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to  the  latest  available  statistics  from  the
Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48,830 Americans died
of gun-related injuries in 2021, more than in any other year on  record;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  figure includes gun murders and suicides, along with
three less common types of gun-related deaths tracked by the CDC,  those
that  were  accidental,  those  that involved law enforcement, and those
whose circumstances could not be determined; and
 
  WHEREAS; In 2021, about eight-in-ten murders  in  the  United  States,
20,958  out  of  26,031, or 81%, involved a firearm, marking the highest
percentage since 1968; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gun murders, in particular, have climbed sharply during the
COVID-19 pandemic, increasing 45%  between  2019  and  2021,  while  the
number of gun suicides rose 10% during that span; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gun  violence  continues  to  be  a  devastating  crisis
throughout the state with an increase of shootings and murders typically
occurring in the summer months; and
 
  WHEREAS, The damage caused by gun violence is not limited by gender,
race, sexual orientation or ethnicity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The effects of gun violence extend far beyond those  struck
by a bullet; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue including  prevention,  intervention,  education  and
outreach; and
 
  WHEREAS, Increased awareness and coordination among all stakeholders
is  critical  to the prevention of gun violence, the equal protection of
our citizens, and to ensure our  state's  safety  for  our  youth;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Gun Violence
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
