 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  enacting the monarch preservation plan
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "monarch preservation plan".
  §  2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that over the
 past several decades, the number of monarch butterflies in North America
 has steeply declined. The great migration of the  eastern  monarchs  has
 been  named  a  "threatened  phenomenon"  by the International Union for
 Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).  As  of  2014,  the
 monarch  population has declined from approximately one billion butterf-
 lies to 35 million, around 90% since 1990.
  Major threat to  monarchs  include  habitat  loss  and  fragmentation,
 changes  in  climate  and  extreme  weather, pesticides, herbicides, and
 genetically modified crops, invasive species, disease and natural preda-
 tors.
  Actively restoring native milkweed and nectar plants, and other polli-
 nator habitat,  and  ensuring  that  key  habitats  are  protected  from
 destruction,  are  critical to ensuring the survival of monarch butterf-
 lies and can also help facilitate conservation of other essential polli-
 nators.  Enhancing pollinator populations can result in  improved  poll-
 ination  services  for  neighboring  land,  including  agriculture  and
 wildlife ecosystems.

  § 3. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 11-0541 to read as follows:
 § 11-0541. MONARCH PRESERVATION PLAN.
  BEGINNING  WITHIN  ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL TAKE FEASIBLE ACTIONS TO CONSERVE  MONARCH  BUTTERFLIES
 AND THE UNIQUE HABITATS THEY DEPEND UPON FOR SUCCESSFUL MIGRATION. THESE
 ACTIONS  MAY  INCLUDE,  BUT  ARE  NOT LIMITED TO, HABITAT RESTORATION ON
 DEPARTMENT AND STATE OWNED  LANDS,  EDUCATION  PROGRAMS,  AND  VOLUNTARY
 AGREEMENTS  WITH  PRIVATE  LANDOWNERS.  THE  DEPARTMENT MAY PARTNER WITH
 FEDERAL AGENCIES,  STATE  AGENCIES,  NONPROFIT  ORGANIZATIONS,  ACADEMIC
 PROGRAMS,  PRIVATE LANDOWNERS, AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT UNDERTAKE ACTIONS
 TO CONSERVE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES AND AID THEIR SUCCESSFUL MIGRATION. WHEN
 UNDERTAKING ACTIONS TO CONSERVE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES AND  THEIR  HABITATS
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL USE THE BEST AVAILABLE
 SCIENCE AND CONSIDER, AS APPROPRIATE AND FEASIBLE, ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
  1.  RESTORING  OR  REVEGETATING  MONARCH  CATERPILLAR  HABITAT  USING
 REGIONALLY  OR  LOCALLY  APPROPRIATE  NATIVE MILKWEED SPECIES AND NATIVE
 NECTAR PLANT SPECIES;
  2. CONTROLLING NONNATIVE WEED SPECIES THAT  THREATEN  NATIVE  MILKWEED
 SPECIES,  AND  CONTROLLING PESTS AND DISEASE, USING CURRENT BEST MANAGE-
 MENT PRACTICES CONSISTENT WITH  INTEGRATED  PEST  MANAGEMENT  PRINCIPLES
 THAT POSE LOW RISK TO MONARCH BUTTERFLIES AND THEIR HABITAT;
  3.  CONTROLLING  PEST  MANAGEMENT  PRACTICES  THAT  MAY  BE HARMFUL TO
 MONARCH BUTTERFLIES, THEIR FOOD OR THEIR HABITAT;
  4. INCORPORATING DIVERSE TREE SPECIES,  STRUCTURES,  AND  ARRANGEMENTS
 WHEN  RESTORING  OR  ESTABLISHING  WINTER HABITAT SITES TO MATCH MONARCH
 BUTTERFLY PREFERENCES FOR TEMPERATURE, LIGHT, MOISTURE, WIND, AND  OTHER
 MICROCLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS; AND
  5.  INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIPS AND MAKING THE MOST OF PART-
 NERSHIPS TO USE RESIDENTIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPED AREAS, AGRICUL-
 TURAL NON-CROPPED  LANDS,  TRANSPORTATION  CORRIDORS,  AND  CONSERVATION
 EASEMENTS TO CREATE, RESTORE, OR ENHANCE MONARCH BUTTERFLY HABITAT.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
