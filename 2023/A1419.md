  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 2 of section 491 of the vehi-
 cle and traffic law, as added by chapter 295 of the  laws  of  1983,  is
 amended to read as follows:

 of  this  subdivision for an amended identification card. THERE SHALL BE
 NO FEE, INCLUDING THE FEE PRESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF  THIS  SUBDIVI-
