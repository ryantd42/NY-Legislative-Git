  § 29-a. Suspension of other laws. 1. A. Subject to the state constitu-
 tion, the federal constitution and federal statutes and regulations, the
 governor may by executive order temporarily suspend specific  provisions
 of  any  statute, local law, ordinance, or orders, rules or regulations,
 or parts thereof, of any agency during a state  disaster  emergency,  if
 compliance  with  such provisions would prevent, hinder, or delay action
 necessary to cope with the disaster.
  B. EVERY ORDER DIRECTING THE  TEMPORARY  SUSPENSION  OF  ANY  STATUTE,
 LOCAL  LAW,  ORDINANCE,  OR ORDER, RULE OR REGULATION, SHALL SPECIFY THE
 INDIVIDUAL COUNTY OR COUNTIES TO BE AFFECTED BY  SUCH  ORDER  AND  SHALL
 PROVIDE  A  DETAILED EXPLANATION AND RATIONALE THAT STATES WITH PARTICU-

 subject to the following standards and limits:
  a. no suspension shall be made for a period in excess of thirty  days,

 ordinance, order, rule or regulation or part thereof to be suspended and
 the terms and conditions of the suspension;
  d.  the  order  may  provide for such suspension only under particular
 circumstances, and may provide for the alteration or modification of the
 requirements of such statute, local law, ordinance, order, rule or regu-
 lation suspended, and may include other terms and conditions;
  e. any such suspension order shall provide for the  minimum  deviation
 from  the requirements of the statute, local law, ordinance, order, rule
 or regulation suspended  consistent  with  the  disaster  action  deemed
 necessary; and
  f.  when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to assist with the
 related emergency actions to avoid needless  adverse  effects  resulting
 from such suspension.
  3. Such suspensions shall be effective from the time and in the manner
 prescribed  in such orders and shall be published as soon as practicable

 PARTICULARITY THE CIRCUMSTANCES, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND  CONDITIONS  OF  SUCH
 COUNTY  OR  CITY THAT JUSTIFIES THE CONTINUANCE OF SUCH AN ORDER RELATED
 TO SUCH POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.  IF THE GOVERNOR FAILS TO RESPOND  WITHIN
 SUCH  FIFTEEN-DAY  PERIOD,  THE STATE DISASTER EMERGENCY AND ALL RELATED
 EXECUTIVE ORDERS SHALL CEASE AND BE OF NO FURTHER  FORCE  OR  EFFECT  AS
 APPLIED TO THE REQUESTING COUNTY OR CITY.
  C.  IF THE GOVERNOR DENIES A REQUEST TO TERMINATE ANY DECLARATION OF A
