  COMMEMORATING the 15th anniversary of Comunilife's
  Life is Precious program
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body that the quality
and character of life in this great Empire State is greatly enriched  by
the  faithful  and  diligent  work of those organizations which serve to
meet the needs of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the  15th  anniversary  of  Comunilife's  Life  is  Precious
program; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 2008, Comunilife's Life is Precious (LIP) program has
provided suicide prevention activities to New York City Latina teens who
have  seriously  considered or attempted suicide; the teens ranging from
ages 12 to 18 are immigrants or first generation  Americans  and  mostly
live  in  some  of  New  York  City's lowest income neighborhoods in the
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Washington Heights; as well as Poughkeepsie and
Yonkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, LIP's program philosophy of "Survive,  Strive  and  Thrive"
means  that  the  program  serves  as  a safe place in which individuals
living with depression, suicide ideation, or other mental illnesses  can
receive  support, engage in activities that allow teens to develop their
unique voice, and access tools that help the teens envision and  achieve
their goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latina adolescent suicide has reached epidemic proportions
in New York State, having become the leading cause of death  for  Latina
teens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hispanic teens face a unique set of challenges with regard
to mental health; Hispanic  culture  can  sometimes  stigmatize  talking
about  mental  health  and issues outside the family, limiting access to
mental health providers; and
 
  WHEREAS, COVID-19 exacerbated these issues, adding an extra level of
stress due to social isolation, overcrowding, unemployment, housing  and
food  insecurity, inadequate remote learning opportunities, inability to
access financial relief due to immigration status, COVID related illness
and fatalities, and increased lack of outpatient mental health capacity;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  LIP  offers  program  activities  that  include  academic
support,  wellness  activities,  expressive  arts  therapy  and  family
services; and
 
  WHEREAS, To date, more than 600 Latina teens  have  participated  in
LIP  and  their  mental health has improved; research studying girls and
their success with the program discovered that for every month a  Latina
teen  participates  in the LIP program her level of suicide ideation and
depression decreases; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Comunilife's  goal  is  to  show  that  LIP is a community
informed, evidence based model of care; the program  directly  addresses
the  risk  factors  associated  with Latina adolescent suicide, provides
culturally competent services that integrate  cultural  norms  into  all
program development, and incorporates the entire family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  under the luminous leadership of Dr. Rosa M.  Gil,
President and CEO of Comunilife, the Life is Precious program  continues
to  evolve  and  successfully  address the needs of the Latina community
that struggle with mental health; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Comunilife's Life is Precious program is  in
direct  correlation  to the efforts of its Board of Directors and staff,
whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the institution and
the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful care on behalf of improving the quality and dignity  of  life
in  the  community,  are  worthy and due full praise and recognition for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  15th  anniversary  of  Comunilife's  Life  is Precious
program; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Comunilife and Dr. Rosa M. Gil.
