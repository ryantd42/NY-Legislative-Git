 AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to granting the legisla-
  ture the authority to direct  the  attorney-general  to  inquire  into
  matters concerning the public peace, public safety and public justice
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 8 of  section  63  of  the  executive  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  451  of  the  laws  of 1977, is amended to read as
 follows:
  8. (A) Whenever in his OR HER judgment the  public  interest  requires
 it,  the  attorney-general  may,  with the approval of the governor, and
 when directed by the governor, shall, inquire  into  matters  concerning
 the  public peace, public safety and public justice. For such purpose he
 OR SHE may, in his OR HER discretion, and without civil service examina-
 tion, appoint and employ, and at pleasure remove, such  deputies,  offi-
 cers  and  other  persons  as he OR SHE deems necessary, determine their
 duties and, with the approval of the governor, fix  their  compensation.
 All  appointments made pursuant to this [subdivision] PARAGRAPH shall be
 immediately reported to the governor, and shall not be reported  to  any
 other state officer or department. Payments of salaries and compensation
 of  officers  and  employees and of the expenses of the inquiry shall be
 made out of funds provided by the legislature for such  purposes,  which
 shall be deposited in a bank or trust company in the names of the gover-
 nor  and the attorney-general, payable only on the draft or check of the
 attorney-general, countersigned by the governor, and such  disbursements
 shall  be  subject  to no audit except by the governor and the attorney-
 general. The attorney-general, his OR  HER  deputy,  or  other  officer,

 OR  ELECTRONIC  COMMUNICATIONS  OR  RECORDS  relevant or material to the

 nates,  clerks  and  employees,  and  all  other  persons, to render and

 one copy of which shall be forthwith, upon its receipt by the  attorney-
 general,  transmitted by him OR HER to the governor. Any officer partic-
 ipating in such inquiry and any person examined as a witness  upon  such
 inquiry  who shall disclose to any person other than the governor or the
 attorney-general the name of any witness  examined  or  any  information
 obtained  upon  such  inquiry, except as directed by the governor or the
 attorney-general, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
  (B) PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT THE  LEGISLATURE  SHALL  BE  EMPOWERED  TO
 DIRECT  THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL  BY  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO INQUIRE INTO
 MATTERS CONCERNING THE PUBLIC PEACE, PUBLIC SAFETY AND  PUBLIC  JUSTICE.

 OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, COUNTERSIGNED BY THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE
 SENATE  AND THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, AND SUCH DISBURSEMENTS SHALL BE

 THAT ANY BOOKS, RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, PAPERS, OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
 OR RECORDS RELEVANT OR MATERIAL TO THE INQUIRY BE TURNED OVER TO HIM  OR
 HER FOR INSPECTION, EXAMINATION OR AUDIT, PURSUANT TO THE CIVIL PRACTICE
 LAW  AND RULES. IF A PERSON SUBPOENAED TO ATTEND UPON SUCH INQUIRY FAILS
 TO OBEY THE COMMAND OF A SUBPOENA WITHOUT  REASONABLE  CAUSE,  OR  IF  A
