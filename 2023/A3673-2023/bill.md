 Furthermore, the legislature finds that New York is trailing behind  the
 rest  of the country in the sale of term life insurance products. There-
 fore, it is the intent of the legislature to help to create more  oppor-
 tunities  for  the  availability  of term life insurance policies in New
 York.

 ING  ANY  REGULATION, RULE, ADVISORY OR OTHERWISE IMPOSING ANY SUITABIL-
 ITY, BEST INTEREST OR FIDUCIARY STANDARD, OR ENFORCING  ANY  SUCH  REGU-

 CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE PURCHASE OF A TERM LIFE INSURANCE POLICY, AS THAT
 TERM IS DEFINED IN THIS CHAPTER, OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXERCISE  OF
 ANY  RIGHT OR CONTRACTUAL OPTION OR AMENDMENT PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS
