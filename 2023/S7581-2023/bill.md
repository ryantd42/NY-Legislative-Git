  (b) The weekly benefit which the  disabled  employee  is  entitled  to

 hundred  eighty-three  and prior to July first, nineteen hundred eighty-
 four shall be one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but in  no
 case  shall  such  benefit exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars nor be
 less  than  twenty dollars; except that if the employee's average weekly
 wage is less than twenty dollars the benefit shall be such average week-
 ly wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is  entitled  to
 receive  for  disability  commencing  on  or  after July first, nineteen
 hundred seventy-four, and prior to July first, nineteen hundred  eighty-
 three,  shall  be one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but in
 no case shall such benefit exceed ninety-five dollars nor be  less  than
 twenty  dollars;  except  that  if the employee's average weekly wage is
 less than twenty dollars, the benefit shall be such average weekly wage.
 The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is  entitled  to  receive
 for  disability  commencing  on  or  after  July first, nineteen hundred
 seventy and prior to July first, nineteen hundred seventy-four shall  be
 one-half  of  the  employee's  average weekly wage, but in no case shall
 such benefit  exceed  seventy-five  dollars  nor  be  less  than  twenty
 dollars;  except that if the employee's average weekly wage is less than

 employee's normal work days per week and multiplying the quotient by the
 number  of  normal  work  days  in such period of disability. The weekly
 benefit for a disabled employee who is concurrently eligible  for  bene-
 fits  in  the employment of more than one covered employer shall, within
 the maximum and minimum herein provided, be one-half of the total of the
 employee's average weekly wages received from all such  covered  employ-
 ers,  and shall be allocated in the proportion of their respective aver-
 age weekly wage payments.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of January following  the
 first  of  September  next  succeeding  the  date on which it shall have
 become a law and shall  apply  to  all  policies  or  contracts  issued,
 renewed, modified, altered or amended on or after such date.
