  4.  STATE  BOARD  HEARINGS.  (A)  A HEARING BY THE STATE BOARD UNDER
 SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION SHALL  BE  LIMITED  TO  THE  ISSUE  OF
 WHETHER,  IN  THE  CASE OF THE DENIAL OF AN APPLICATION, THE DECISION OF
 THE LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS WAS CONSISTENT WITH REGIONAL NEEDS, OR
 WHETHER SUCH APPLICATION WAS IMPROPERLY  DENIED  BY  SUCH  LOCAL  ZONING
 BOARD  OF  APPEALS  PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (B) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS
 SECTION; AND, IN THE CASE OF AN APPROVAL OF AN APPLICATION  WITH  CONDI-
 TIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED, WHETHER SUCH CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
 MAKE THE CONSTRUCTION OR OPERATION OF SUCH HOUSING UNECONOMIC AND WHETH-
 ER THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH REGIONAL NEEDS.  THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN SUCH
 STATE  BOARD  HEARINGS  SHALL BE UPON THE RESPONDENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT
 A. 3111  5
 
 THE DECISION OF THE LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS WAS PERMISSIBLE PURSU-
 ANT TO THIS SECTION.  IF THE STATE BOARD FINDS, IN THE CASE OF A DENIAL,
 THAT THE DECISION OF THE LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS WAS NOT  CONSIST-
 ENT  WITH REGIONAL NEEDS, IT SHALL VACATE SUCH DECISION AND SHALL DIRECT
 SUCH LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO ISSUE A  COMPREHENSIVE  PERMIT  OR
 APPROVAL  TO  THE APPLICANT. IF THE STATE BOARD FINDS, IN THE CASE OF AN
 APPROVAL WITH CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED, THAT THE DECISION  OF
 THE  LOCAL  ZONING  BOARD  OF APPEALS MAKES THE BUILDING OR OPERATION OF
 SUCH HOUSING UNECONOMIC AND IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH  REGIONAL  NEEDS,  IT
 SHALL  ORDER  SUCH LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO MODIFY OR REMOVE ANY
 SUCH CONDITION OR REQUIREMENT SO AS  TO  MAKE  THE  PROPOSAL  NO  LONGER
 UNECONOMIC  AND  TO  ISSUE  ANY  NECESSARY PERMIT OR APPROVAL; PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THAT THE STATE BOARD SHALL  NOT  ISSUE  ANY  ORDER  THAT  WOULD
 PERMIT  THE  BUILDING  OR  OPERATION  OF SUCH HOUSING IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 STANDARDS LESS SAFE THAN THE APPLICABLE BUILDING AND SITE PLAN  REQUIRE-
 MENTS  OF  THE  FEDERAL  HOUSING  ADMINISTRATION OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE
 REQUIREMENTS, WHICHEVER AGENCY IS FINANCIALLY  ASSISTING  SUCH  HOUSING.
 DECISIONS OR CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY A LOCAL ZONING BOARD
 OF APPEALS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH REGIONAL NEEDS SHALL NOT BE VACATED,
 MODIFIED  OR  REMOVED BY THE STATE BOARD NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SUCH DECI-
 SIONS OR CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS  HAVE  THE  EFFECT  OF  MAKING  THE
 APPLICANT'S PROPOSAL UNECONOMIC.
  (B)  THE STATE BOARD OR THE PETITIONER SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ENFORCE
 THE ORDERS OF THE STATE BOARD AT LAW OR IN EQUITY IN  COURT.  THE  LOCAL
 ZONING  BOARD  OF  APPEALS  SHALL CARRY OUT THE ORDER OF THE STATE BOARD
 WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF ITS ENTRY AND, UPON FAILURE TO DO SO, THE ORDER OF
 THE STATE BOARD SHALL, FOR ALL PURPOSES, BE DEEMED TO BE THE  ACTION  OF
 SUCH  LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, UNLESS THE PETITIONER CONSENTS TO A
 DIFFERENT DECISION OR ORDER BY SUCH LOCAL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
  (C) IF A MUNICIPALITY APPEALS A DECISION OF THE  STATE  BOARD  TO  THE
 COURT  UNDER  ARTICLE SEVENTY-EIGHT OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES,
 AND THE COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF THE APPLICANT  FOR  A  LOW  OR  MODERATE
 INCOME  HOUSING  DEVELOPMENT IN SUCH PROCEEDING, SUCH MUNICIPALITY SHALL
 BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ANY LEGAL COSTS INCURRED BY SUCH APPLICANT  AS  A
 RESULT OF SUCH APPEAL.

 ESTABLISHED, WITHIN THE DIVISION, A STATE ZONING BOARD  OF  APPEALS,  TO

  (C)  THE  STATE BOARD SHALL HAVE THE POWER AND DUTIES TO CONDUCT HEAR-
 INGS, ISSUE ORDERS, AND OTHERWISE  PERFORM  ANY  FUNCTION  NECESSARY  TO
 OPERATE  IN  CONFORMITY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. IN ADDITION
 TO THE FUNCTIONS OR DUTIES SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED OR AUTHORIZED  PURSUANT

 section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Such  study  shall  consider
 whether  and how to revise the qualified allocation plan in light of the
 processes for building low or moderate income housing under section 14-a
 of the public housing law, such that the state's  policies  for  funding
 and  permitting  low  and moderate income housing can best be aligned to
 most effectively produce  affordable  housing.  Such  study  shall  also
 consider  whether such an alignment can support the state's fair housing
 goals.  The commissioner shall submit a report of the  division's  find-
 ings  of such study and any recommendations to the governor, the speaker
