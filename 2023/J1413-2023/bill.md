  an individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
recognize  and  acknowledge  those  within  our  midst  who  have  made
significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
caring concern and heroic acts of exemplary citizens who take prompt and
appropriate action in emergency situations, and in doing so, help others
to avert life-threatening danger; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend  Elizabeth
Mae  Maxwell and Viviana Bravo upon the occasion of their designation as
recipients of a Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, At approximately 5:45 pm, on Wednesday, May 25, 2022,  then
17-year-old  Viviana  Bravo  and  then 18-year-old Elizabeth Mae Maxwell
were traveling on the Adirondack State Northway between exits 15 and  16
when  they  noticed  a  truck  swerving in between the lanes in front of
them; and
 
  WHEREAS, A man was driving along the road  with  his  wife  when  he
suddenly  lost  consciousness;  after  she  was  able to safely pull the
vehicle over to the side of the road, Viviana Bravo  and  Elizabeth  Mae
Maxwell  also pulled over and immediately called 911 before running over
to help the couple; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon their arrival, Viviana Bravo and Elizabeth Mae Maxwell
quickly  noticed  the  woman  was  panicking  because  her  husband  was
unconscious  and had stopped breathing; without regard for their safety,
the two teenagers opened the  car  door,  pulled  the  man  out  of  the
driver's  seat, carefully placed him on the ground, and began to perform
CPR on him, the first time they had done so on a human being; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shortly thereafter, the Wilton EMS arrived on the scene and
took over with an AED to continue life-saving  measures;  Viviana  Bravo
and  Elizabeth  Mae Maxwell stayed with the wife to comfort her and pray
with her while EMS was working on her husband; and
 
  WHEREAS, Praised for their swift actions, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell  and
Viviana  Bravo  demonstrated their true character and genuine compassion
for the welfare of others, personifying, by virtue of their actions, the
collective concern of ordinary citizens  across  the  community  of  the
State of New York who voluntarily respond when others are in need; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  First  generation  Mexican-American  Viviana Bravo studied
culinary arts and hospitality at BOCES where she was an award winner  at
the  SkillsUSA  competition;  today,  she is a sophomore at the Culinary
Institute of America  pursuing  her  bachelor's  degree  in  Hospitality
Management; and

of 2022, Elizabeth Mae Maxwell is majoring  in  Culinary  Arts  at  SUNY
Adirondack; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Justly  recognized  as  heroes,  Elizabeth Mae Maxwell and
Viviana Bravo richly merit the admiration of this Legislative  Body  and
their  community  for  their consummate courage and heroic actions; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Elizabeth  Mae  Maxwell  and Viviana Bravo upon the occasion of
their designation as recipients of a Liberty Medal,  the  highest  honor
bestowed  upon  an  individual  by  the New York State Senate; and be it
further
