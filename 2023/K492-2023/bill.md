  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 8, 2023, as STEAM Day in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to highlight the significance of strong
science, technology, engineering, art and mathmatics skills; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 8, 2023, as STEAM
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
National STEAM Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebrated  annually  on  November 8th, National STEAM Day
focuses on helping students advance in STEAM fields as  we  continue  to
push the boundaries of exploration and soar into the future; and
 
  WHEREAS, STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and
Math and is a common acronym in the education world to refer to the ways
in  which  these  important  subjects and skills can be used in schools,
future careers, and educational activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, STEAM takes STEM one step further by emphasizing the  arts,
taking  inspiration  from  the  field  and  applying  its  concepts  in
cross-discipline  learning  that  supports  creativity  in  science,
mathematics and more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  STEAM  education programs are a vital component to pushing
society forward, and more must be done at a local,  State  and  National
level  to  find  fun  and  engaging  ways  to  teach  our students; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 8, 2023, as STEAM
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
