 AN ACT to amend the town law, the village law, the county  law  and  the
  election law, in relation to moving certain elections to even-numbered
  years

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 80 of the town law is amended to read as follows:
  § 80. Biennial town elections. [Except as otherwise provided  in  this
 chapter,  a]  A biennial town election for the election of town officers
 and for the consideration of such questions as may be  proposed  by  the
 town board or the duly qualified electors, pursuant to the provisions of
 this  chapter,  shall  be  held on the Tuesday next succeeding the first
 Monday in November of every [odd-numbered] EVEN-NUMBERED year. All other
 town elections are special elections. A town election  or  special  town
 election  held pursuant to this chapter, shall be construed as a substi-
 tute, for a town meeting or a special town meeting  heretofore  provided
 to  be  held  by  law,  and  a reference in any law to a town meeting or
 special town meeting shall be construed as referring to a town  election
 or special town election.
  § 2. Subdivision 4 of section 17-1703-a of the village law, as amended
 by chapter 513 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  4.  In  any  case in which the proposition provided for in subdivision
 one of this section shall have resulted in favor of the local government
 operating principally as a town, then, at the regular  village  election
 next ensuing, all offices to be filled thereat shall be filled for terms
 to  end at the conclusion of the then current calendar year. The term of
 office of each other elected  village  office  shall  also  end  at  the
 conclusion  of said then current calendar year, notwithstanding that any
 such term of office originally extended beyond such date. The offices of
 supervisor, four town council members and two  town  justices  shall  be

 filled  by  election  as  hereinafter  provided  at the November general
 election next following the effective date of the creation of such  town
 or annexation of such territory; all other town offices shall be appoin-
 tive. The election of the supervisor, council members and justices shall
 be for terms of office as follows:
  (a)  If such election is held in an [odd-numbered] EVEN-NUMBERED year,
 then the term of office for  supervisor  shall  be  the  term  regularly
 provided  by  law;  the terms of office for two council members shall be
 the terms regularly provided by law and the  terms  for  the  other  two
 council members shall be two years each; the term for each justice shall
 be  the  term  regularly provided by law. Upon the expiration of the two
 year term for council members as above  provided,  the  terms  for  such
 offices shall be as regularly provided by law.
  (b)  If such election is held in an [even-numbered] ODD-NUMBERED year,
 then the term of office for supervisor shall be one year; the  terms  of
 office for council members shall be one year for two council members and
 three  years  for  the other two council members and the terms of office
 for each justice shall be for the remainder of the then unexpired terms.
 Thereafter, each office shall be filled for the term regularly  provided
 by law.
  §  3. Subdivision 11 of section 7-104 of the election law, as added by
 chapter 411 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  11. [The offices appearing on all  ballots  shall  be  listed  in  the

 YORK  STATE  COMPTROLLER, NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES
 SENATOR, MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR,

  (B)  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE OFFICES IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION, ALL OTHER OFFICES SHALL BE PLACED UPON THE BALLOT IN THE CUSTOM-
 ARY ORDER; PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT PARTISAN OFFICES  REGARDLESS  OF  THE

 OFFICES AND ALL CANDIDATES FOR JUDICIAL OFFICES SHALL FOLLOW  ALL  OTHER
 PARTISAN OFFICES.
  § 4. Section 400 of the county law is amended by adding a new subdivi-
 sion 8 to read as follows:
  8.  ALL  ELECTIONS FOR ANY POSITION OF A COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIAL SHALL
 OCCUR ON THE TUESDAY NEXT SUCCEEDING THE FIRST MONDAY  IN  NOVEMBER  AND
 SHALL OCCUR IN AN EVEN-NUMBERED YEAR; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  NOT APPLY TO AN ELECTION FOR THE OFFICE OF SHERIFF, COUNTY CLERK,
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY, FAMILY COURT JUDGE,  COUNTY  COURT  JUDGE,  SURROGATE
 COURT  JUDGE,  TOWN JUSTICE, OR ANY OFFICES WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM AS OF

  § 5. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law or of any other
 general, special, or local law,  a  county  elected  official,  or  town
 elected  official  elected  and serving their term as of January 1, 2025
 shall complete their full term  as  established  in  local  law.  This
 section shall not apply to an election for the office of sheriff, county
 clerk, district attorney, family court judge, county court judge, surro-
 gate court judge, and town justice.
  §  6.  Any county or town official that is elected in an odd-numbered
 year after January 1, 2025, shall have their  term  expire  as  if  such
 S. 3505  3
 
 official  were elected at the previous general election held in an even-
 numbered year; provided however in no event shall such expiration  occur
 later than December 31 of such following year. Such term shall be appli-
 cable  to  any general, special, or local law pertaining to term limits.
 Nothing in this section shall prohibit a county or town from enacting  a
 local  law  to  alter  or permit alteration of an official's term limit.
 This section shall not apply to an election for the office  of  sheriff,
 county clerk, district attorney, family court judge, county court judge,
 surrogate court judge, and town justice.
  §  7.  Severability.  If  any provision of this act is held invalid or
 ineffective in whole or in part or inapplicable to any person  or  situ-
 ation, such invalidity or holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate
 other  provisions  or  applications of this act that can be given effect
 without the invalid provision or application, and all  other  provisions
 thereof  shall  nevertheless  be  separately and fully effective, and to
 this end the provisions of this act are declared to be severable.
  § 8. This act shall take effect  immediately;  provided  however  that
 sections  one, two, three and four of this act shall take effect January
 1, 2025.
