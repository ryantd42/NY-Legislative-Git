  even-numbered years
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 80 of the town law is amended to read as follows:
  § 80. Biennial town elections. [Except as otherwise provided  in  this
 chapter,  a]  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION OF ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL OR

 the duly qualified electors, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,

 ber of every [odd-numbered] EVEN-NUMBERED year. All other town elections

 pursuant to this chapter, shall be construed as a substitute, for a town
 meeting or a special town meeting heretofore provided to be held by law,

 shall be construed as referring to  a  town  election  or  special  town
 election. ANY TOWN COMPLETELY COTERMINOUS WITH A VILLAGE SHALL  CONTINUE
 TO ELECT ITS OFFICERS, INCLUDING TOWN JUSTICES, IN ODD-NUMBERED YEARS IF
 BOTH  SUCH  VILLAGE AND TOWN LAST HELD SUCH ELECTIONS IN AN ODD-NUMBERED
 YEAR PRIOR TO JANUARY  FIRST,  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.

  § 2. Subdivision 4 of section 17-1703-a of the village law, as amended
 by chapter 513 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  4.  In  any  case in which the proposition provided for in subdivision
 one of this section shall have resulted in favor of the local government
 operating principally as a town, then, at the regular  village  election
 next ensuing, all offices to be filled thereat shall be filled for terms
 to  end at the conclusion of the then current calendar year. The term of
 office of each other elected  village  office  shall  also  end  at  the
 conclusion  of said then current calendar year, notwithstanding that any
 such term of office originally extended beyond such date. The offices of
 supervisor, four town council members and two  town  justices  shall  be
 filled  by  election  as  hereinafter  provided  at the November general
 election next following the effective date of the creation of such  town
 or annexation of such territory; all other town offices shall be appoin-
 tive. The election of the supervisor, council members and justices shall
 be for terms of office as follows:
  (a)  If such election is held in an [odd-numbered] EVEN-NUMBERED year,
 then the term of office for  supervisor  shall  be  the  term  regularly
 provided  by  law;  the terms of office for two council members shall be
 the terms regularly provided by law and the  terms  for  the  other  two
 council members shall be two years each; the term for each justice shall
 be  the  term  regularly provided by law. Upon the expiration of the two
 year term for council members as above  provided,  the  terms  for  such
 offices shall be as regularly provided by law.
  (b)  If such election is held in an [even-numbered] ODD-NUMBERED year,
 then the term of office for supervisor shall be one year; the  terms  of
 office for council members shall be one year for two council members and
 three  years  for  the other two council members and the terms of office
 for each justice shall be for the remainder of the then unexpired terms.
 Thereafter, each office shall be filled for the term regularly  provided
 by law.
  § 3. Section 400 of the county law is amended by adding a new subdivi-
 sion 8 to read as follows:
  8.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION  OF  ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL
 LAW, CHARTER, CODE, ORDINANCE, RESOLUTION, RULE  OR  REGULATION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY,  ALL  ELECTIONS  FOR ANY POSITION OF A COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIAL
 SHALL OCCUR ON THE TUESDAY NEXT SUCCEEDING THE FIRST MONDAY IN  NOVEMBER
 AND  SHALL OCCUR IN AN EVEN-NUMBERED YEAR; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THIS SUBDI-
 VISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN ELECTION FOR THE OFFICE OF SHERIFF,  COUNTY
 CLERK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, FAMILY COURT JUDGE, COUNTY COURT JUDGE, SURRO-
 GATE COURT JUDGE, OR ANY OFFICES WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM PRIOR TO JANUARY
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.
  §  4. Paragraph g of subdivision 3 of section 34 of the municipal home
 rule law, as amended by chapter 24 of the laws of 1988, is amended and a
 new paragraph h is added to read as follows:
  g. In this chapter or in the civil service law, eminent domain  proce-
 dure  law,  environmental conservation law, election law, executive law,
 judiciary law, labor law, local  finance  law,  multiple  dwelling  law,
 multiple  residence  law,  public  authorities  law, public housing law,
 public service law, railroad law, retirement and  social  security  law,
 state  finance law, volunteer firefighters' benefit law, volunteer ambu-
 lance workers' benefit law, or workers' compensation law[.]; AND
  H. INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  COUNTIES,  OTHER  THAN
 COUNTIES  IN  THE  CITY  OF NEW YORK, TO HOLD ELECTIONS IN EVEN-NUMBERED
 YEARS FOR ANY POSITION OF A COUNTY  ELECTED  OFFICIAL,  OTHER  THAN  THE
 OFFICE  OF SHERIFF, COUNTY CLERK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, FAMILY COURT JUDGE,
 S. 3505--B  3
 
 COUNTY COURT JUDGE, SURROGATE COURT JUDGE, OR ANY COUNTY OFFICES WITH  A
 THREE-YEAR TERM PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.
  §  5.  Notwithstanding  any provision of any general, special or local
 law, charter, code, ordinance, resolution, rule  or  regulation  to  the
 contrary,  a  county elected official, or town elected official, subject
 to the requirements of sections one, two, three, or four  of  this  act,
 elected  and  serving  their  term  as of January 1, 2025 shall complete
 their full term as established by law.  Provided, however, that  if  the
 completion  of  such full term results in the need for an election in an
 odd-numbered year after January 1, 2025, the  county  or  town  official
 elected  at  such election shall have their term expire as if such offi-
 cial were elected at the previous general election held in an  even-num-
 bered year. Provided, further, that such term shall not be applicable to
 any general, special, or local law pertaining to term limits. Nothing in
 this  act shall prohibit a county, town, or any village subject to arti-
 cle seventeen of the village law, from enacting a local law to alter  or
 permit alteration of an official's term limit.
  §  6.  Severability.  If  any provision of this act is held invalid or
 ineffective in whole or in part or inapplicable to any person  or  situ-
 ation, such invalidity or holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate
 other  provisions  or  applications of this act that can be given effect
 without the invalid provision or application, and all  other  provisions
 thereof  shall  nevertheless  be  separately and fully effective, and to
 this end the provisions of this act are declared to be severable.
  § 7. This act shall take effect  immediately;  provided  however  that
 sections  one, two, three and four of this act shall take effect January
 1, 2025.
