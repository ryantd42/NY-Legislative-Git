 AN ACT to amend the family court act, the domestic relations law and the
  criminal  procedure  law, in relation to orders of protection in cases
  involving domestic violence
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  opening paragraph of section 842 of the family court
 act, as amended by chapter 335 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  An  order  of protection under section eight hundred forty-one of this
 part shall set forth reasonable conditions of behavior  to  be  observed
 for  a period not in excess of two years by the petitioner or respondent
 or for a period not in excess of five years upon (i) a  finding  by  the
 court  on  the  record  of the existence of aggravating circumstances as
 defined in paragraph (vii) of subdivision (a) of section  eight  hundred
 twenty-seven  of  this  article;  or  (ii) a finding by the court on the
 record that the conduct alleged in the petition is  in  violation  of  a
 valid  order  of  protection.  IN CASES INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AN
 ORDER OF PROTECTION SHALL BE OBSERVED BY THE  PETITIONER  OR  RESPONDENT
 FOR  A  PERIOD  OF  NO  LESS THAN FIVE YEARS. Any finding of aggravating
 circumstances pursuant to this section shall be stated on the record and
 upon the order of protection. The court may also,  upon  motion,  extend
 the  order  of protection for a reasonable period of time upon a showing
 of good cause or consent of the parties. The fact  that  abuse  has  not
 occurred  during  the pendency of an order shall not, in itself, consti-
 tute sufficient ground for denying or failing to extend the  order.  The
 court  must articulate a basis for its decision on the record. The dura-
 tion of any temporary order shall not by itself be a factor in determin-
 ing the length or issuance of any final order.  Any order of  protection

 tion  of  any other order made under this part. Such order of protection
 shall remain in effect concurrently with, shall expire no later than the

 order  made  under  this part, except as provided in subdivision four of
 this section. The order of protection may set  forth  reasonable  condi-
 tions of behavior to be observed for a specified time by a person who is

 mining the duration of an order of protection entered pursuant  to  this

 has been replaced by a youthful offender adjudication.  In  addition  to
 any other conditions, such an order may require the defendant:
