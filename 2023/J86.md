  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Osteoporosis Awareness  and  Prevention
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Osteoporosis
Awareness and Prevention Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction
with  the  observance  of National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Osteoporosis Awareness and  Prevention  Month  was
developed  to promote good bone health through prevention, detection and
treatment of osteoporosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone density
and weakness which heightens the risk of a broken bone; it is  the  most
common reason for a broken bone among the elderly and frail; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bones  that  commonly  break  include the vertebrae in the
spine, the bones of the forearm, and the  hip;  unfortunately,  until  a
broken  bone occurs there are typically no symptoms; bones may weaken to
such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2010, eight million women and one  to  two  million  men
were diagnosed with osteoporosis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Osteoporosis  becomes  more  common with age; about 15% of
white people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected, and  it
is  more  common  in  women  than men; approximately 80% of osteoporosis
cases are women; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals are encouraged to understand the  risk  factors
associated  with  this  condition,  and  take preventative measures that
promote healthy bones such as sufficient calcium intake, adequate levels
of vitamin D, and performing bone healthy exercises; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the  local, State and national levels to support the patients as well as
their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Osteoporosis
Awareness and Prevention Month in the State  of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
