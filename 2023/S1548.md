  (c) [consider where  practicable,  the  severability  of  construction
 projects and other bundled contracts; and
  (d)]  consider  compliance  with  the  requirements of any federal law

 prises  which  effectuates  the purpose of this section. The contracting
 agency shall determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any
 such law duplicate or conflict with the provisions hereof  and  if  such
 duplication  or  conflict exists, the contracting agency shall waive the

 conflict.
