 Introduced  by  Sen.  RIVERA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation  to  requiring  chain
  restaurants  to  label  menu  items  that have a high content of added
  sugars

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings. The legislature hereby finds added
 sugars include sugars that are added to foods and beverages during proc-
 essing. They include foods packaged as sweeteners, syrups and honey, and
 sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices. They do not  include
 naturally  occurring  sugars that are found in milk, fruits, and vegeta-
 bles. The daily value for added sugars established by the  federal  Food
 and  Drug  Administration  is  50 grams per day based on a 2,000-calorie
 daily diet, equivalent to approximately  12  teaspoons.  Healthy  eating
 patterns  that  are relatively lower in added sugars, less than 50 grams
 per day, are associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular  disease,
 type  2  diabetes, and certain types of cancers. Unfortunately, American
 adults consume an average of 17 teaspoons of added sugars per day, about
 40 percent more than currently recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for
 Americans.
  The leading source of added sugars in the  American  diet,  accounting
 for  24  percent  of our intake, is sugar-sweetened beverages-like soda,
 fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, flavored milk, and sweetened
 coffee. These are followed closely by desserts and sweet  snacks,  which
 account  for  19  percent  of  our  added  sugars  intake. Sugary drinks
 contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, in
 part by leading to weight gain, and are  linked  to  a  higher  risk  of
 dental  cavities. Regularly consuming sugary drinks, seven or more serv-
 ings per week, is associated with a statistically significant 29 percent
 increase in risk of  dying  from  cardiovascular  disease,  compared  to

 consuming one serving per week or less. Consuming one or more 12-oz cans
 of  soda  per  day  significantly increases the risk of dying from heart
 disease.
  Healthy  eating  patterns  that are low in added sugars are associated
 with a reduced risk of cardiovascular  disease,  type  2  diabetes,  and
 certain  types of cancers. Warning icons are an effective tool to reduce
 added sugars consumption. Research from randomized controlled trials has
 shown that warnings on sugary drinks  can  significantly  reduce  sugary
 drink  purchases.  Sugary drink consumption dropped by nearly 25 percent
 in the 18 months after the country of  Chile  adopted  "high  in  sugar"
 nutrient  warnings  on  food  and  drink  packaging nationwide. This act
 implements added sugar warnings on menu items at chain restaurants.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 1357  to
 read as follows:
