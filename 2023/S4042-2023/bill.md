 project.

 manager of the project and generally describe the  financial  assistance
 OR  PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAXES contemplated by the agency with respect to
 the project.
  4. Each agency shall develop a standard application form, which  shall
 be  used  by  the  agency to accept requests for financial assistance OR
 PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAXES from all individuals, firms, companies, devel-
 opers or other entities or organizations. The standard application  form
 shall  be submitted by or on behalf of the applicant, and subscribed and
 affirmed under the penalties of perjury by the applicant, or  on  behalf
 of the applicant by the chief executive officer or such other individual

 the facility or plant was located.
  6.  Each  agency shall develop a uniform agency project agreement that
 sets forth terms and conditions  under  which  financial  assistance  OR
 PAYMENTS  IN LIEU OF TAXES shall be provided. The uniform agency project
 agreement shall be used by the agency and  no  financial  assistance  OR
 PAYMENTS  IN  LIEU  OF  TAXES  shall  be  provided in the absence of the
