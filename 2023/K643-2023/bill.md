  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 14, 2023, as Chess Day in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body takes great pleasure in celebrating
those board games of  historic  and  artistic  significance  which  have
contributed  to  the  cultural enrichment of our communities and Nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 14, 2023, as Chess
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
National Chess Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Held every second Saturday in October, Chess Day recognizes
the  complex  art  form  that  has captivated players and viewers alike;
chess sharpens the mind, tests human faculties, and  encourages  healthy
competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chess  is  a  two-player  board  game in which each player
formulates a strategy and defense to capture the King; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Chess Association (NYSCA) is the  oldest
continuously-run  chess  organization  in the United States, having been
formed in Auburn, New York in 1878; it is the official  New  York  State
affiliate  of the United States Chess Federation (USCF), and its history
pre-dates the establishment of USCF; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  association  organizes  a  variety  of
State-sanctioned  championship  tournaments  across  the  Empire  State,
including the Annual New York State Chess Championship, which  has  been
held in Albany on Labor Day weekend since 2006; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Renowned  New  York  State  champions  have included Bobby
Fischer, Joel Benjamin, Jose Capablanca, and Frank Marshall; the current
Scholastic champion is New York City player FM Gus Huston; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since  the  early  Crusades,  chess  has  been  enjoyed  by
millions  of people in various parts of the world; the earliest versions
of the game differ, but from the 15th century onwards, the design became
standardized and the modern chess that we know today is adapted from old
Indian and Persian games; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having had a  significant  impact  on  social  development,
Benjamin  Franklin  elevated the status of American chess with his essay
titled "The Morals of Chess"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Though there are many well-versed players, Paul  Morphy  is
considered  to  be  the  first American chess legend and is known as the
best chess player of his time; in 1857, he was  the  first  American  to
beat the best European chess player, Adolph Anderssen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1976,  President  Gerald Ford initiated National Chess
Day, as he considered chess a kings' game and was an avid follower;  the
day  is  meant to inspire beginners and experts to delve into the unique
world of chess; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chess  Day's purpose is to invoke people to read about the
history of the royal game of chess that has been  played  for  centuries
and to take part in the board game; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 14, 2023, as Chess
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the New York State Chess Association.
