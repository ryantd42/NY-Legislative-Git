  division of research and analysis to assist the legislature
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature seeks to create  a  new
 nonpartisan  division  which shall provide assistance to the legislature
 with analysis of issues and policies in order to facilitate the  lawmak-
 ing  process.  This division shall serve all members of both house cham-
 bers equally and without bias. The legislature further intends to create
 a division that shall empower the legislature by  providing  independent
 and  trustworthy  information  to  the  legislature,  and  will maintain
 adequate staffing to allow the legislature to consider the  best  inter-
 ests of the state.
  §  2. Section 7-a of the legislative law, as amended by chapter 746 of
 the laws of 1974, and the third undesignated paragraph as added by chap-
 ter 867 of the laws of 1984, is amended to read as follows:
  § 7-a. Legislative library, librarian and assistants.  1.  (A)  There
 shall  be  a  legislative  library to be located in the state capitol in
 rooms assigned by the commissioner  of  general  services,  conveniently
 accessible  to  the  members  of  both  houses  of legislature, and such
 library shall be open throughout the year.
  (B) Such library shall be suitably furnished, equipped and  maintained
 under  the  direction of the legislative librarian, within the amount of
 any moneys available therefor by appropriation, subject to joint  rules,
 if any, that may be adopted by the senate and assembly in relation ther-
 eto.  There shall be, for such library, a legislative librarian and such
 assistant librarians and other employees as may be provided for  in  the
 legislative appropriation bill. Such librarian, assistant librarians and
 other employees shall be chosen by the temporary president of the senate

 assigned by the legislative librarian to have charge of the  legislative
 correspondents'  room  in  the  capitol.  The  legislative librarian and
 assistant  librarians  heretofore  chosen by the president of the senate
 and speaker of the assembly, and in office when this section  as  hereby
 amended  takes  effect,  shall  continue to serve until their successors
 shall be chosen.  The  salaries  and  compensation  of  the  legislative
 librarian,  assistant  librarians  and  other employees shall be payable
 from moneys appropriated in the legislative appropriation bill. During a
 vacancy in the office of legislative librarian, the assistant  librarian
 who shall have been longest in the service of the state as a legislative
 employee,  shall  be  employed  as acting legislative librarian with the
 powers and duties of such librarian, and shall receive during such peri-
 od the compensation herein prescribed  for  the  legislative  librarian.
 Such librarian shall have charge of the legislative library, but the two
 houses  of  the legislature may, by joint rules, regulate the use of the
 library and prescribe the powers and duties of the legislative librarian
 and the assistant librarians.
