  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that the distrib-
 ution  of state highway funding has not been equitable across regions in
 New York. It is the intent of this  legislation  to  ensure  that  state
 highway funding is distributed fairly and efficiently across all regions
 of the state.
  § 2. Report on the distribution of state highway funding by region. 1.
 Within  six  months of the effective date of this act, the department of
 transportation shall issue a report breaking out state  highway  funding
 by  region  for the previous 20 years. The report shall include a break-
 down of the funding by project, region, and type of funding. The  report
 shall  also  include an analysis of how the funding has been distributed
 across regions and an assessment of the equity  and  efficiency  of  the
 current distribution system.
  2. Such regions shall be delineated by:
  (a)  Counties of Albany, Essex, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenec-
 tady, Warren, Washington;
  (b) Counties of Herkimer, Fulton, Hamilton, Madison, Montgomery, Onei-
 da;

 van;

  §  3.  Program  evaluation.  The  commissioner of transportation shall
 cause to be performed an evaluation of the preventative  maintenance  of
 state  highways and bridges in each department of transportation region.
 Such evaluation shall include, but not be limited to:
  (a) an assessment of the adequacy of the preventative  maintenance  of
 state highways and bridges;
  (b)  an  assessment  of  the adequacy of the department of transporta-
 tion's pavement management  system  and  bridge  management  system  and
 recommendations to those systems;
  (c)  recommendations for any improvements to any improvements or tech-
 nological advances in the way by which the state should  maintain  state
 highways and bridges; and
  (d) an assessment as to whether the level or allocation of funding for
 the preventative maintenance of state highways and bridges is sufficient
 considering  the  goals  for  the  condition of the state's highways and
 bridges for the next five fiscal years.
  § 4.  Development  of  formula  for  future  distribution.  After  the
 completion of the report and program evaluation required by sections two
 and  three of this act, the department of transportation shall develop a
 formula for distributing state highway funding across regions in a  fair
 and  efficient  manner. The formula shall take into account factors such
 as population density,  traffic  volume,  road  conditions,  state  lane
 miles,  and  economic  activity.  The formula shall also ensure that all
 department of transportation regions of the state receive  an  equitable
 share  of  state  highway  funding.  The  formula shall be completed and
 proposed at the time the report is due.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
