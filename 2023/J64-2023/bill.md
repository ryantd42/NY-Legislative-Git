  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 1-7, 2023, as CPR-AED  Awareness  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
serious  health  concerns,  proclaiming  official  weeks  to  increase
awareness of such concerns, which affect thousands of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  1-7,  2023, as
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator
(AED) Awareness Week in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  the
observance of National CPR-AED Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart disease affects men, women, and children of every age
and  race  in  the  United  States, and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a
leading cause of death in the  United  States,  affecting  approximately
356,000 people of all ages outside hospitals annually; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  week alone, about 6,800 unsuspecting victims
will suffer SCA, most of them at home (about 70 percent);  their  hearts
will  unexpectedly  stop  beating  and  blood will no longer flow to the
brain and throughout  the  body;  they  will  collapse,  stop  breathing
normally, and may appear to be having seizures; in essence, they will be
dead  and  they  will stay this way unless bystanders act immediately to
restore their heartbeats with CPR and defibrillation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Unfortunately, only 46 percent of SCA victims receives  the
help that they need from bystanders before EMS arrives at the scene; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  every  minute  that  passes  without  CPR  and
defibrillation, the chances of survival decrease by 7-10 percent;  as  a
result,  only  10  percent  of victims typically survive; survival rates
could double or triple if more people knew what to do when SCA  strikes;
in  fact,  as  many as 50,000 additional lives could be saved each year;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2007, the United States Federal Government passed a bill
that recognized CPR and AED Awareness Week on a  yearly  basis;  CPR-AED
Awareness  Week helps to spread information and encourage more people to
learn how to properly perform CPR and use AED machines to save  people's
lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes the critical importance of
increasing  the  survival  rate from cardiac arrest and of incorporating
the tools of CPR and AED into  aggressive  programs  in  order  to  save
thousands of lives each year; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 1-7, 2023, as CPR-AED
Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
