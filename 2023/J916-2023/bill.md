  COMMENDING  the  West Indian American Day Carnival
  Association upon the occasion of hosting its  Annual
  West  Indian  Labor  Day  Carnival  and  Parade  on
  September 4, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize  and  pay tribute to those
organizations which foster ethnic  pride  and  enhance  the  profile  of
cultural  diversity  which  strengthens the fabric of the communities of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend  the  West
Indian  American  Day  Carnival Association upon the occasion of hosting
its Annual West Indian Labor Day Carnival and  Parade  on  September  4,
2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year  marks  the 56th Anniversary of the West Indian
American Day Carnival and Parade; the centerpiece of the Carnival is the
extraordinary  colorful  Parade  consisting  of  many  vibrant  floats,
exquisite costumes, a cacophony of music, Caribbean entertainment stars,
and various food vendors selling West Indian delicacies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  West  Indian  American  Day Carnival Association is a
historic community organization dedicated to promoting, developing,  and
celebrating  Caribbean  culture,  arts,  food,  history, traditions, and
people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1967 and headquartered in  New  York  City,  the
West  Indian  American  Day  Carnival  Association collaborates with the
community on programming and throughout the year which culminates with a
week-long display of festivities and a grand finale Carnival Parade; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its mission, the West Indian American Day
Carnival Association (WIADCA) promotes,  develops,  and  celebrates  the
West Indian/Caribbean culture, arts history, and tradition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  History of Carnival is as colorful as the present-day
festival; its roots lie in the festivities of the original  civilization
in  Ancient Kemet (Egypt); the many tribes that gathered around the Nile
Delta practiced similar ceremonies to praise their deities; these tribes
were nomads and settled near and far; many Yoruba, Ibo and Hausa  tribes
settled  in  the  western region of Africa, and some of them ended up in
the Caribbean in the 1700s and 1800s because of slavery; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this early period, the French, Spanish  and  British
aristocracy  held  grand  and  lavish  costume  balls, feasts, and small
street parades; after the  abolishment  of  slavery,  the  character  of
Carnival  changed,  becoming  more  colorful  and  spectacular  with
magnificent and elaborately designed costumes; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of the Caribbean have  exported  their  carnival
traditions  to  Canada,  England,  and  several  United  States  cities;
 
however, the New York  version  of  this  celebration  far  exceeds  any
similar celebration in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The earliest known Carnival street activity was held during
the 1940s, when Ms. Wardell secured the first street permit for a parade
event  on  the streets of Harlem; during the 1960s, another Trinidadian,
Rufus Goring, brought Carnival to Brooklyn; and
 
  WHEREAS, The "Labor Day Carnival Parade" has grown  over  the  years
from  thousands  of participants and tourists to over 3.5 million people
in attendance since the mid-1990s; the influx of tourists from all  over
the world has benefited New York on an economic level, most recognizably
with  large  corporations,  small  businesses,  and  the tourist/service
industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, they served  over
75,000  hot  meals  to  the  elderly,  proving  to  truly care about the
community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  cultural  events  which  symbolize  the historical, social, and
cultural development of this great State and embody the  spirit  of  the
principles upon which this Nation was founded; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the West Indian  American  Day  Carnival  Association  upon  the
occasion of hosting its Annual West Indian Labor Day Carnival and Parade
on September 4, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the West Indian American Day Carnival Association.
