 AN  ACT  authorizing  the  assessor of the city of Long Beach, county of
  Nassau, to accept from New Beth El, Inc. an application for  exemption
  from real property taxes

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the city of Long Beach,  county  of  Nassau,  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from  New  Beth  El, Inc., an application for an
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real
 property tax law, with respect to the 2019-2020 assessment roll, for the
 parcel owned by such organization, with such parcel being located at  70
 West  Beech  Street,  city  of  Long  Beach, county of Nassau, parcel ID
 59-25-11. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as  if  it  had
 been  received on or before the taxable status date established for such
 rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the city council of Long Beach, county of Nassau, may make
 appropriate correction to the subject roll. If such exemption is  grant-
 ed,  and  such  organization,  therefore,  shall  have paid any tax with
 respect to the subject rolls,  the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax
 department  may, at its sole discretion, provide for the refund of those
 taxes paid and cancel those taxes, fines, penalties, liens  or  interest
 remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
