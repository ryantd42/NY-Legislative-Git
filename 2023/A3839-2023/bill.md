 try,  state,  territory or federal district of his residence relative to

 may  be,  and  the display of registration numbers thereof, and provided

 by a non-resident if so used or operated with his permission, express or
 implied, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such  non-resi-
 dent  of  the secretary of state to be his true and lawful attorney upon
 A. 3839  4
 
 whom may be served the summons in any action against him, growing out of
 any [accident] CRASH or collision in  which  such  non-resident  may  be
 involved while using or operating such vehicle in this state or in which
 such  vehicle may be involved while being used or operated in this state
 in the business of such non-resident or with the permission, express  or
 implied,  of such non-resident owner; and such use or operation shall be
 deemed a signification of his agreement that any  such  summons  against
 him  which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as
 if served on him personally within the state and within the  territorial
 jurisdiction  of  the court from which the summons issues, and that such
 appointment of the secretary of state shall be irrevocable  and  binding
 upon  his  executor  or  administrator. Where such non-resident has died
 prior to the commencement of an action brought pursuant to this section,
 service of process shall be made on the  executor  or  administrator  of
 such  non-resident  in  the  same  manner  and  on the same notice as is
 provided in the case of the non-resident himself. Where  an  action  has
 been  duly commenced under the provisions of this section against a non-

 ter 418 of the laws of 1964, is amended to read as follows:

 state subsequent to the [accident] CRASH or collision and remains absent
 therefrom for thirty days continuously, whether such absence is intended
 to be temporary or permanent, and to any executor  or  administrator  of
 such  resident, and (b) to an executor or administrator of a resident if
 such executor or administrator is a nonresident or if, being a resident,
 he departs from the state and remains absent therefrom for  thirty  days
 continuously, whether such absence is intended to be temporary or perma-
 nent.
  §  12. Section 301-a of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by chap-
 ter 634 of the laws of 1973, and subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 608
 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  § 301-a. Re-inspection of motor vehicles involved  in  certain  [acci-
 dents]  CRASHES.  1. The commissioner may require that a motor vehicle
 registered in this state or elsewhere which is required to be inspected,
 be re-inspected after it is involved in  a  property  damage  [accident]
 CRASH  which is required to be reported to the motor vehicle department.
 Such re-inspection shall be made within sixty days of the  date  of  the
 [accident] CRASH if the motor vehicle is driven away from the [accident]
 CRASH site. Such re-inspection shall be made before the vehicle is oper-
 ated on the public highways if the motor vehicle is towed or transported
 from the [accident] CRASH site, except that a motor vehicle may be driv-
 en  from a repair shop to an inspection station for the purpose of being
 re-inspected.
  2. The owner of a car so damaged shall be required to  submit  to  the
 department  within the same time limit as provided in subdivision one of
 this section satisfactory proof of re-inspection pursuant to  rules  and
 regulations to be promulgated by the commissioner.
  3.  Failure  to  submit such proof of re-inspection as herein provided
 shall constitute ground for suspension or revocation of  his  privileges
 A. 3839  5
 
 of  operating  a motor vehicle in this state and of the operation within
 this state of any motor vehicle owned by him.
  §  13.  Subdivision 2 of section 310 of the vehicle and traffic law is
 amended to read as follows:
  (2) Declaration of purpose. The  legislature  is  concerned  over  the
 rising  toll  of motor vehicle [accidents] CRASHES and the suffering and
 loss thereby inflicted. The legislature determines that it is  a  matter
 of  grave concern that motorists shall be financially able to respond in
 damages for their negligent acts, so  that  innocent  victims  of  motor
 vehicle [accidents] CRASHES may be recompensed for the injury and finan-
 cial  loss inflicted upon them.  The legislature finds and declares that
 the public interest can best  be  served  in  satisfying  the  insurance
 requirements  of  this  article  by  private  enterprise  operating in a
 competitive market to provide proof of financial  security  through  the
 methods prescribed herein.
  § 14. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 311 of the vehicle and
 traffic  law,  as amended by chapter 305 of the laws of 1995, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (a) Affording coverage as defined in the minimum provisions prescribed
 in a regulation which shall be  promulgated  by  the  superintendent  at
 least  ninety  days prior to effective date of this act. The superinten-
 dent before promulgating such  regulations  or  any  amendment  thereof,
 shall  consult  with all insurers licensed to write automobile liability
 insurance in this state and shall not prescribe minimum provisions which
 fail to reflect the provisions of automobile liability  insurance  poli-
 cies,  other than motor vehicle liability policies as defined in section
 three hundred forty-five of this chapter, issued within  this  state  at
 the  date of such regulation or amendment thereof.  Nothing contained in
 such regulation or in this  article  shall  prohibit  any  insurer  from
 affording  coverage  under an owner's policy of liability insurance more
 liberal than that required by  said  minimum  provisions.  Every  such
 owner's policy of liability insurance shall provide insurance subject to
 said  regulation  against  loss  from  the  liability imposed by law for
 damages, including damages for care and loss  of  services,  because  of
 bodily  injury to or death of any person and injury to or destruction of
 property arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or operation of
 a specific motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the state of New York,
 or elsewhere in the United States in North America or  the  Dominion  of
 Canada,  subject  to  a  limit,  exclusive  of  interest and costs, with
 respect to each such motor vehicle except a tow  truck,  of  twenty-five
 thousand  dollars  because  of  bodily  injuries  to  and fifty thousand
 dollars because of death of one person in any one [accident] CRASH  and,
 subject  to  said  limit  for  one  person, to a limit of fifty thousand
 dollars because of bodily injury to and  one  hundred  thousand  dollars
 because of death of two or more persons in any one [accident] CRASH, and
 to  a  limit of ten thousand dollars because of injury to or destruction
 of property of others in any one  [accident]  CRASH  provided,  however,
 that such policy need not be for a period coterminous with the registra-
 tion period of the vehicle insured. The limit, exclusive of interest and
 costs,  with  respect to a tow truck shall be a combined single limit of
 at least three hundred thousand dollars  because  of  bodily  injury  or
 death  to  one  or  more  persons or because of injury or destruction of
 property of others in any one [accident] CRASH, and to a limit of  twen-
 ty-five  thousand  dollars  because  of damage to a vehicle in the care,
 custody and control of the insured. Any insurer authorized to  issue  an
 owner's  policy  of  liability insurance as provided for in this article
 A. 3839  6
 
 may, pending the issue of such a policy, make an agreement, to be  known
 as  a binder, or may, in lieu of such a policy, issue a renewal endorse-
 ment or evidence of renewal of an existing policy; each of  which  shall
 be  construed  to  provide indemnity or protection in like manner and to
 the same extent as such a policy. The provisions of this  article  shall
 apply  to  such  binders,  renewal endorsements or evidences of renewal.
 Every such policy issued insuring private passenger vehicles  and  every
 renewal policy, renewal endorsement, or other evidence of renewal issued
 shall  have  attached  thereto  a  rating information form which clearly
 specifies  and  defines  the  rating  classification  assigned  thereto,
 including any applicable merit rating plan; and
  §  15.  Subdivision 1 of section 315 of the vehicle and traffic law is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. The commissioner, upon the surrender of the registration and number
 plates for a motor vehicle for which a financial security bond or depos-
 it was accepted by the commissioner, shall permit  the  cancellation  of
 any  such  bond or shall direct that any such deposit be returned by the
 commissioner of taxation and finance. The commissioner shall not release
 such bond or deposit in the event any action for damages upon a  liabil-
 ity referred to in this article is then pending or any judgment upon any
 such  liability  then  outstanding  and unsatisfied, or in the event the
 commissioner has received notice that such person has within the  period
 of  three  months immediately preceding been involved as a driver in any
 motor vehicle [accident] CRASH.  An affidavit of the applicant  of  non-
 existence  of  such  facts  shall  be sufficient evidence thereof in the
 absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the bureau.
  § 16. Section 316 of the vehicle and traffic law, the  third  undesig-
 nated  paragraph  as amended by chapter 511 of the laws of 1999, and the
 fourth undesignated paragraph as added by chapter 316  of  the  laws  of
 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  § 316. Self-insurers.  The  commissioner,  in his discretion, may upon
 the application of a person having registered in his name in this  state
 more  than twenty-five motor vehicles, issue a certificate of self-insu-
 rance when he is reasonably satisfied that such person is possessed  and
 will  continue  to be possessed of financial ability to respond to judg-
 ments obtained against such person, arising out of the ownership,  main-
 tenance,  use or operation of any such person's motor vehicles. Upon due
 notice and hearing, the commissioner may, in  his  discretion  and  upon
 reasonable grounds, cancel a certificate of self-insurance.
  As a condition to the issuance of a certificate of self-insurance, the
 registrant shall pay annually in addition to any other fee prescribed by
 this chapter, a fee of one dollar and fifty cents for each motor vehicle
 registered  in  his  name and the aggregate amount of such fees shall be
 applied in reduction of the assessment levied pursuant to section  three
 hundred seventeen OF THIS ARTICLE.
  As  a further condition to the issuance of a certificate of self-insu-
 rance, the registrant shall pay annually in addition to  any  other  fee
 prescribed  by  this  chapter, an amount per vehicle to be determined by
 the Motor Vehicle [Accident] CRASH Indemnification Corporation  pursuant
 to section five thousand two hundred seven of the insurance law for each
 motor  vehicle  registered  in his name and the aggregate amount of such
 fees shall be transmitted by  the  commissioner  to  the  Motor  Vehicle
 [Accident]  CRASH  Indemnification  Corporation  continued  pursuant  to
 section five thousand two hundred three  of  the  insurance  law  to  be
 applied  in reduction of assessments levied by said corporation pursuant
 to section five thousand two hundred seven of the insurance law.

 amended by chapter 1025 of the laws of  1971,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  9.  (a) If a motor vehicle has been involved in [an accident] A CRASH,
 and its registration or the driver's license of its operator,  or  both,
 have  been  revoked  pursuant to this section, then neither such vehicle
 nor any other motor vehicle shall be registered or reregistered  in  the
 name  of  its  owner  or of any other person legally responsible for its
 use, nor shall any driver's license be issued to such owner,  person  or
 operator  until  one  year  has passed since the date of such revocation
 and, as the case may be, the commissioner has received the payments  and
 evidence required by paragraph (c) [below] OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (b) If a motor vehicle not registered in this state is involved in [an
 accident] A CRASH in this state and the privilege of its operation with-
 in  this  state  has  been  revoked,  then neither its owner, any person
 legally responsible for its use nor  its  operator  shall  exercise  the
 privilege  of  the  operation  of  such vehicle within this state or the
 privilege of operation within this state of any motor vehicle, until one
 year has passed since the date of revocation and, as the  case  may  be,
 the  commissioner  has received the payments and evidence as required in
 PARAGRAPH (c) [below] OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (c) The payments and evidence referred to in paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)
 [above]  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  shall  be  evidence, satisfactory to the
 commissioner,

 such  owner,  person  legally responsible or operator has been commenced
 within a period of one year from the date of the [accident] CRASH  or  a
 release thereof has been given to such owner, person or operator, or
  (2)  That  no judgment arising out of such cause of action for amounts
 within the limits stated in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of section

 ator remains unsatisfied, except that such  registration  and  licensing
 privileges  may be restored on compliance with the procedures permitting
 the payment of a judgment in  installments  provided  in  section  three
 hundred thirty-four OF THIS TITLE, and
  (3)  That  all  civil  penalties required to be paid to the department
 pursuant to the provisions of subdivision five of section three  hundred
 nineteen of this [chapter] ARTICLE have been paid.

 dent] CRASH indemnification corporation  or  an  insurer  has  paid  any
 amount  towards  satisfaction  of a judgment against such person, or has
 obtained a judgment against such person as a result of payments made  to
 third  parties  such  license,  privileges  or  registration  shall  be
 suspended, or the suspension or revocation thereof shall  be  continued,
 as provided in this subdivision.
  §  19.  Paragraphs (a) and (c) of subdivision 12 of section 318 of the

 A. 3839  8
 
 laws of 1980, and paragraph (c) as amended by chapter 805 of the laws of

 in  [an  accident] A CRASH occurring in this state resulting in death or
 bodily injuries to any person fails to produce satisfactory evidence  as
 proof  of  financial  security within forty-eight hours after the [acci-
 dent] CRASH, the motor vehicle shall be subject to impoundment  and  any
 peace  officer,  acting  pursuant  to  his special duties, or any police
 officer is authorized to impound and store such motor vehicle.  If  said
 motor  vehicle  is  subject  to impoundment and is not so impounded, the
 owner or his representative shall cause said motor vehicle to be  stored
 in  a  public  garage  or storage place in this state as selected by the
 owner or representative and shall continue such storage for  the  period
 of  time  provided  in  this  section.  The aforementioned storage shall
 constitute "impoundment" within the meaning of this section. The cost of
 storage of any such impounded motor vehicle shall be borne by the owner.
 So long as the impoundment is  in  force  no  person  shall  remove  the
 impounded  vehicle or permit it to be removed from its place of impound-
 ment except upon the order of the commissioner.
  (c) The impoundment shall continue until (1) there is a final disposi-
 tion of the claim for death or bodily injury of  the  person,  resulting
 from  the  [accident] CRASH in which said motor vehicle was involved, by
 payment of a judgment or settlement by the owner, or by a final judgment
 in his favor, or (2) one year has elapsed since the date of  the  [acci-
 dent]  CRASH  and no filing has been made pursuant to section five thou-
 sand two hundred eight of the insurance law, or (3)  a  release  of  the

 sioner of taxation and finance of security or a bond in  such  form  and
 amount  as may be approved by the commissioner. If said motor vehicle is
 not released from impoundment after the lapse of one year,  the  commis-
 sioner  may dispose of it by public sale and remit the proceeds from the
 sale to the commissioner of taxation and finance to be held pending  the
 final disposition of the claim.

 amended to read as follows:
  (d)  Any  person whose license, registration or non-resident's driving

 provided  for in this article was in force and effect at the time of the

  §  22.  Section 335 of the vehicle and traffic law, subdivision (a) as
 amended by chapter 305 of the laws of 1995, and paragraph 1 of  subdivi-
 sion  (a)  as  further amended by section 104 of part A of chapter 62 of
 the laws of 2011, is amended to read as follows:
  § 335. Security and proof required following [accident] CRASH. (a) Not
 less than ten days nor more than sixty days after receipt by him of  the
 report  or  notice of [an accident] A CRASH which has resulted in bodily
 injury or death, or in damage to the  property  of  any  one  person  in
 excess of one thousand dollars, the commissioner shall forthwith suspend
 the  license  of any person operating, and the registration certificates
 and registration plates of any person owning, a  motor  vehicle  in  any
 manner  involved in such [accident] CRASH unless and until such operator
 (or chauffeur) or owner or both shall have previously furnished or imme-
 diately furnishes security sufficient in the judgment of the commission-
 er to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from  such
 [accident]  CRASH as may be recovered against such owner or operator (or
 chauffeur) by or on behalf of any aggrieved person or his  legal  repre-
 sentative, and unless and until such owner or operator (or chauffeur) or
 both  shall  immediately furnish and thereafter maintain proof of finan-
 cial responsibility in the  future.  Where  erroneous  information  with
 respect to insurance coverage of the owner or operator (or chauffeur) of
 any  such vehicle is furnished to the commissioner, he shall take appro-
 priate action as above provided within sixty days after the  receipt  by
 him  of  correct information with respect to such coverage. This section
 shall not apply: (1) to such owner or operator (or  chauffeur)  if  such
 owner had in effect at the time of such [accident] CRASH with respect to
 such  motor vehicle a standard provisions automobile liability policy in
 form approved by the superintendent of financial services and issued  by
 an insurance company authorized to do business in this state or, if such
 motor  vehicle  was  not registered in this state or was a motor vehicle
 which was registered elsewhere than in this state at the effective  date
 of the policy, or the most recent renewal thereof, an automobile liabil-
 ity  policy  acceptable  to  the superintendent of financial services as
 substantially the equivalent  of  such  standard  provisions  automobile
 liability  policy; (2) to such operator (or chauffeur), if not the owner
 of such motor vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of such [acci-
 dent] CRASH such a policy with respect to his operation of  motor  vehi-
 cles  not owned by him or, if such motor vehicle was a private passenger
 motor vehicle, with respect to his operation of private passenger  motor
 vehicles  not  owned  by him or (3) to such owner or operator (or chauf-
 A. 3839  10
 
 feur) if the liability of such owner  or  operator  (or  chauffeur)  for
 damages  resulting from such [accident] CRASH is, in the judgment of the
 commissioner, covered by any other form of  liability  insurance  policy
 issued  by  an insurance company authorized to do business in this state
 or by a bond, provided every such policy or  bond  mentioned  herein  is
 subject,  if  the  [accident]  CRASH has resulted in bodily injury, to a
 limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of twenty-five thousand  dollars
 or  death to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of fifty thousand
 dollars, because of bodily injury to or death of one person in  any  one
 [accident]  CRASH  and, subject to said limit for one person, to a limit
 of fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury  to  or  one  hundred
 thousand  dollars  because  of  death  of two or more persons in any one
 [accident] CRASH, and, if the [accident] CRASH has resulted in injury to
 or destruction of property, to a limit of ten thousand  dollars  because
 of  injury to or destruction of property of others in any one [accident]
 CRASH or (4) to such owner or operator if the commissioner shall  deter-
 mine  that the failure to have liability coverage as described above was
 caused solely by the negligence or malfeasance of a  person  other  than
 the  person  whose  license  or  registration  has  been suspended or is
 subject to suspension, and that the person seeking to avoid such suspen-
 sion was not aware of the lack of such liability coverage. However, with
 respect to the provisions of (4) above, the burden  of  proof  shall  be
 upon  the  person  seeking  to  avoid  such  suspension action. Provided
 further, that such facts shall be established by  clear  and  convincing
 evidence,  either by the submission of affidavits or at a hearing called
 in the discretion of the commissioner.
  Upon receipt of notice of such [accident] CRASH, the insurance carrier
 or surety company which issued such policy or  bond  shall  furnish  for
 filing  with  the commissioner a written notice that such policy or bond
 was in effect at the time of such [accident] CRASH or shall  notify  the
 commissioner  in  such  manner  as he may require in case such policy or
 bond was not in effect at the time of such [accident] CRASH.
  In case any such operator (or chauffeur) or owner has  no  license  to
 operate  issued under this chapter or no motor vehicle registered in his
 name in this state, he shall not be allowed a  license  or  registration
 until  he  has complied with this article to the same extent as would be
 necessary if he had held an operator's  or  chauffeur's  license  and  a
 motor  vehicle registration issued under this chapter at the time of the
 [accident] CRASH.
  (b) Such security, where ordered, shall be in such form  and  in  such
 amount  as the commissioner may require, but in no case in excess of the
 amount of proof required by section  three  hundred  forty-one  of  this
 article.  The  commissioner may reduce the amount of security ordered in
 any case within six months after the date of the [accident]  CRASH,  if,
 in  his  judgment, the amount ordered is too large. In case the security
 originally ordered has been deposited, the  excess  deposited  over  the
 reduced  amount  ordered  shall  be  returned  to  the  depositor or his
 personal representative forthwith,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
 subdivision (c) of this section.
  (c)  Security  furnished  in  compliance with the requirements of this
 section shall be placed by  the  commissioner  in  the  custody  of  the
 commissioner of taxation and finance and shall be applicable only to the
 payment  of  a judgment against the depositor for damages arising out of
 the [accident] CRASH in question in an action at  law  begun  not  later
 than  one  year after the date of such [accident] CRASH or, upon assign-
 ment of the depositor, made not later than one year after  the  date  of
 A. 3839  11
 
 such  [accident] CRASH, to the settlement of a claim arising out of such
 [accident] CRASH, or upon assignment of the depositor,  made  after  the
 expiration  of  one year after the date of such [accident] CRASH, to the
 settlement  of  an action at law begun not later than one year after the
 date of such [accident] CRASH. All of such  payments  made  out  of  the
 deposited  security  shall  be made as follows:  Payment shall first be
 made to each of the judgment creditors and to each of the claimants  who
 have  agreed to settle their claims, whose damages were evaluated by the
 commissioner, in an amount not greater than the amount  fixed  in  their
 respective  evaluations.  Whenever  the  commissioner  shall  be  given
 evidence, satisfactory to him,  that  the  amounts  of  all  claims  for
 damages  against  the depositor arising out of such [accident] CRASH are
 fixed, either by judgment or settlement agreement, payment shall be made
 out of any balance remaining after the first  distribution  to  each  of
 those  persons whose judgments or settlement amounts have not been fully
 paid but whose damages were evaluated by the commissioner, in proportion
 to the amounts of their respective evaluations unless  there  is  suffi-
 cient to make payment in full; and any balance remaining after the first
 and  second  distributions are completed shall be paid to those judgment
 creditors and those claimants who have agreed to settle their claims but
 whose damages were not evaluated, in proportion to the amounts of  their
 respective judgments or settlement amounts unless there is sufficient to
 make  payment  in  full.  Such deposit, or any balance thereof, shall be
 returned to the depositor or his personal representative whenever  after
 the  expiration  of such year, the commissioner shall be given evidence,
 satisfactory to him, that there is no such action pending  and  no  such
 judgment  unsatisfied  or  whenever, before the expiration of such year,
 the commissioner shall be given  evidence,  satisfactory  to  him,  that
 there  is  no  such  judgment  unsatisfied and that there is no existing
 cause of action against the depositor for damages arising  out  of  such
 [accident] CRASH.
  (c-1) After security, furnished in compliance with the requirements of
 this  section,  has remained on deposit for five years, the commissioner
 shall make a determination as to whether the  deposit,  or  any  balance
 thereof,  is returnable to the depositor or the person entitled thereto.
 In the event that such deposit, or any balance thereof, is determined to
 be returnable, but remains unclaimed by  the  depositor  or  the  person
 entitled  thereto  for  a  period of one year following the date of such
 determination, such unclaimed deposit, or any balance thereof, shall  be
 deemed  abandoned  property  subject  to the provisions of the abandoned
 property law.
  (d) The provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall not  apply
 to  the  owner  of  a  motor  vehicle  operated  by  one having obtained
 possession or control thereof without the expressed or  implied  consent
 of  such owner, to a police officer or member of the state police who is
 compelled to assume the custody and operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  of
 another  because  such  motor vehicle was (1) stolen from or lost by the
 owner, (2) abandoned, either by the owner or any other  person  with  or
 without  the owner's consent, (3) is being operated by a person disabled
 so as not to be able to operate it properly, or (4) is being operated by
 an intoxicated person; or to either the owner or  operator  of  a  motor
 vehicle  involved in an [accident] CRASH wherein no damage or injury was
 caused to other than the person or property of such owner or operator.
  (e) In lieu of deposit of  security  when  required  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of this section the commissioner may accept a written agree-
 ment, executed and acknowledged by the person required to deposit  secu-
 A. 3839  12
 
 rity and any person who has sustained bodily injury, including death, or
 damage  to  his property, or his legal representative, providing for the
 payment of an agreed amount in installments, with respect to the  claims
 of  such  person  for  injuries or damages resulting from the [accident]
 CRASH.  In the event of default in payment of any installment under such
 agreement, then upon notice  of  such  default  the  commissioner  shall
 forthwith  suspend  the license and registration certificates and regis-
 tration plates of the person in default until  release  has  been  filed
 with  the commissioner indicating that the entire agreed amount has been
 paid. But in no case shall such agreement be used in lieu  of  proof  of
 maintenance  of financial responsibility in the future required pursuant
 to the provisions of this section.
  § 23. Section 337 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by  chap-
 ter 176 of the laws of 1990, is amended to read as follows:
  § 337. Suspension,  duration.  (a) The suspension required in sections
 three hundred thirty-two, three hundred thirty-four and SUBDIVISION  (E)
 OF  SECTION three hundred thirty-five [(e)] OF THIS ARTICLE shall remain
 in effect, the motor vehicle in any manner involved in  such  [accident]
 CRASH  shall  not  be registered in the name of the person whose license
 and/or registration certificate was so suspended, or in any  other  name
 where  the  commissioner  has  reasonable  grounds  to believe that such
 registration will have the effect of  defeating  the  purposes  of  this
 article,  and  no other motor vehicle shall be registered in the name of
 such person nor any new licenses issued to such person unless and  until
 such  judgment is satisfied or stayed or is discharged in bankruptcy and
 the judgment debtor gives  proof  of  financial  responsibility  in  the
 future as required pursuant to section three hundred thirty-five OF THIS
 ARTICLE  except under the conditions as stated in sections three hundred
 thirty-three and three hundred thirty-four OF THIS ARTICLE.
  (b) The suspension required in section three  hundred  thirty-five  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  shall  remain  in effect, the motor vehicle in any manner
 involved in such [accident] CRASH shall not be registered in the name of
 the  person  whose  license  and/or  registration  certificate  was  so
 suspended,  or  in  any other name where the commissioner has reasonable
 grounds to believe that  such  registration  will  have  the  effect  of
 defeating the purposes of this article, and no other motor vehicle shall
 be  registered in the name of such person nor any new licenses issued to
 such person, unless and until such person complies with the  requirement
 with respect to furnishing security, or unless and until such person has
 obtained  a  release,  or  a  favorable  judgment in an action at law to
 recover damages resulting from such  [accident]  CRASH  or  unless  such
 person  shall  have satisfied in the manner herein provided any judgment
 rendered against such person in such an action, or unless such  judgment
 rendered  against  such  person  is discharged in bankruptcy, and at all
 events until such person gives and thereafter  maintains  proof  of  his
 financial responsibility.
  Provided,  however,  that  any  person  whose  license or registration
 became subject to suspension or has been suspended pursuant to  subdivi-
 sion  (a)  of section three hundred thirty-five OF THIS ARTICLE, whether
 or not such person has furnished security and proof of financial respon-
 sibility, shall be relieved from  furnishing  or  maintaining  proof  of
 financial  responsibility  if (1) one year has elapsed since the date of
 the [accident] CRASH, (2) nine months have elapsed  since  the  date  of
 compliance with any suspension order made against such person because of
 such  [accident]  CRASH,  (3) such person has neither paid nor agreed in
 writing to pay anything  for  damages  resulting  from  such  [accident]
 A. 3839  13
 
 CRASH,  (4) no suit for damages because thereof has been brought against
 such person and (5) such person is not required to furnish  or  maintain
 proof  of financial responsibility for some reason other than for having
 been  involved in such [accident] CRASH.  If a suit or suits for damages
 resulting from such [accident] CRASH shall have been  brought  and  such
 suit  or  suits  shall  have  resulted  in  a judgment or judgments, the
 successful person in such suit or suits shall be relieved from  furnish-
 ing  or maintaining proof of financial responsibility forthwith provided
 such person is not required  to  furnish  or  maintain  such  proof  for
 reasons  other  than  for  having been involved in such [accident] CRASH
 and, in case such person has furnished security because of  having  been
 involved  in  such [accident] CRASH, it shall be returned to such person
 or the personal representative of such person forthwith  notwithstanding
 the  provisions  of subdivision (c) of section three hundred thirty-five
 OF THIS ARTICLE. The fact of having been  involved  in  such  [accident]
 CRASH shall not bar the issuance of license and registration to a person
 who  has been relieved from furnishing or maintaining proof of financial
 responsibility pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
  (c) A discharge in bankruptcy following  the  rendering  of  any  such
 judgment  shall not relieve the judgment debtor from any of the require-
 ments of this article unless otherwise provided in subdivisions (a)  and
 (b) of this section.
  §  24.  Subdivision (d) of section 338 of the vehicle and traffic law,
 the opening paragraph as amended by chapter 838 of the laws of 1970,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (d)  The  commissioner  shall take action as required anywhere in this
 article, upon receiving proper evidence that any resident of this state,
 has in any other state had his driving privileges suspended  and/or  the
 operation of any motor vehicle owned by him prohibited pursuant to a law
 of such other state providing for such suspension or prohibition because
 of  a  conviction  or  because  of  an  unsatisfied judgment which would
 require the commissioner to suspend a non-resident's driving  privileges
 had  such a conviction or judgment been rendered in this state against a
 non-resident, provided, however, that no suspension or prohibition shall
 be effective until twenty days have elapsed from  the  date  upon  which
 notice  of  suspension  shall  have been mailed to the operator or owner
 during which period such operator or owner shall be permitted to  submit
 evidence  of  satisfaction  of  the  judgment or other evidence relating
 thereto.
  Upon receipt of a certification that  the  operating  privilege  of  a
 resident  of  this state has been suspended, revoked or cancelled in any
 such other state pursuant to a law providing for its suspension, revoca-
 tion or cancellation for failure to deposit security for the payment  of
 a  judgment  as  may arise out of a motor vehicle [accident] CRASH under
 circumstances which would require the commissioner  to  suspend  a  non-
 resident's operating privilege had the [accident] CRASH occurred in this
 state, the commissioner shall suspend the license of such resident if he
 was  the operator, and all of his registrations if he was the owner of a
 motor vehicle involved in such [accident] CRASH.  Such suspension  shall
 continue  until  such resident furnishes evidence of his compliance with
 the law of such other state relating to the deposit of such security.
  § 25. Section 341 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by  chap-
 ter 305 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  § 341. Amount  of  proof  required.  Proof of financial responsibility
 shall mean proof of ability to respond in damages for  liability  there-
 after  incurred,  arising  out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
 A. 3839  14
 
 motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars because  of
 bodily  injury  to or fifty thousand dollars because of death of any one
 person, and subject to said limit respecting one person, in  the  amount
 of  fifty  thousand  dollars  because of bodily injury to or one hundred
 thousand dollars because of death of two or  more  persons  in  any  one
 [accident]  CRASH,  and in the amount of ten thousand dollars because of
 injury to or destruction of property in any one [accident] CRASH.  Such
 proof  in  such amounts shall be furnished for each motor vehicle regis-
 tered by such person.
  § 26. Subdivision (c) of section 343 of the vehicle and  traffic  law,
 as amended by chapter 300 of the laws of 1960, and as further amended by
 section  104  of part A of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (c) When a person has been required to furnish proof  of  a  financial
 responsibility  and  there  has been in effect a motor vehicle liability
 policy for his benefit for a period of three years, during which  period
 such  person or any vehicle registered in his name has not been involved
 in any [accident] CRASH upon which a  report  is  required  pursuant  to
 section  six hundred five [hereof] OF THIS CHAPTER, such person may file
 in lieu thereof, the written certificate of any insurance  carrier  duly
 authorized  to  do  business  in this state, certifying that there is in
 effect  a  standard  provisions  automobile  liability  policy  in  form
 approved  by  the  [superintendant] SUPERINTENDENT of financial services
 with a limit of liability no less than provided in  subdivision  (a)  of
 section three hundred thirty-five of this [law] ARTICLE.
  §  27.  Paragraphs  1  and  3 of subdivision (a) of section 344 of the
 vehicle and traffic law are amended to read as follows:
  (1) Said insurance carrier shall execute a power of attorney authoriz-
 ing the commissioner to accept service on its behalf of notice or  proc-
 ess  in  any  action  arising out of a motor vehicle [accident] CRASH in
 this state.
  (3) Said insurance carrier shall also agree to  accept  as  final  and
 binding  any  judgment  of  any  court of competent jurisdiction in this
 state duly rendered in any action arising out of a motor vehicle  [acci-
 dent] CRASH.
  § 28. Paragraph 3 of subdivision (b) of section 345 of the vehicle and
 traffic  law,  as amended by chapter 305 of the laws of 1995, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (3) Shall insure the insured or such other person  against  loss  from
 the liability imposed by law for damages, including damages for care and
 loss  of services because of bodily injury to or death of any person and
 injury to or destruction of property arising out of the ownership, main-
 tenance, use, or operation of such motor vehicle or motor vehicles with-
 in the state of New York, or elsewhere in the  United  States  in  North
 America  or  the  Dominion  of  Canada, subject to a limit, exclusive of
 interest and cost, with respect to each such motor vehicle, except a tow
 truck, of twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily  injury  to  or
 fifty  thousand dollars because of death of one person in any one [acci-
 dent] CRASH and, subject to said limit for one person,  to  a  limit  of
 fifty  thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or one hundred thou-
 sand dollars because of death of two or more persons in any  one  [acci-
 dent] CRASH, and to a limit of ten thousand dollars because of injury to
 or  destruction  of  property of others in any one [accident] CRASH. The
 limit, exclusive of interest and costs, with  respect  to  a  tow  truck
 shall  be  a  combined  single  limit  of three hundred thousand dollars
 because of bodily injury [of] OR death to one or more persons or because
 A. 3839  15
 
 of injury or destruction of property of others  in  any  one  [accident]
 CRASH,  and to a limit of twenty-five thousand dollars because of damage
 to a vehicle in the care, custody and control of the insured.
  § 29. Paragraph 1 of subdivision (i) of section 345 of the vehicle and
 traffic law is amended to read as follows:
  (1) The liability of any company under a motor vehicle liability poli-
 cy  shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by said policy
 occurs, and the satisfaction by the insured of a final judgment for such
 loss or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right  or  duty
 of  the  carrier  to  make payment on account of such loss or damage. No
 such policy shall be cancelled or  annulled  as  respects  any  loss  or
 damage  by  any  agreement between the carrier and the insured after the
 said insured has become responsible for such loss  or  damage,  and  any
 such  cancellation or [annullment] ANNULMENT shall be void. If the death
 of the insured shall occur after the insured has  become  liable  during
 the  policy  period for loss or damage covered by the policy, the policy
 shall not be deemed terminated  by  such  death  with  respect  to  such
 liability  and the company shall be liable thereunder in the same manner
 and to the same extent as though death had not occurred. Upon the recov-
 ery of a final judgment against any person for any such loss or  damage,
 if  the  judgment  debtor  or the decedent whom he represents was at the
 accrual of the cause of action insured against liability therefor  under
 a  motor  vehicle liability policy, the judgment creditor shall be enti-
 tled to have the insurance money applied  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
 judgment.  But  the  policy may provide that the insured, or any other
 person covered by the policy, shall reimburse the company  for  payments
 made  on  account  of  any  [accident]  CRASH, claim or suit involving a
 breach of the  terms,  provisions  or  conditions  of  the  policy;  and
 further,  if the policy shall provide for limits in excess of the limits
 designated in this section, the insurance carrier may plead against such
 judgment creditor, with respect to the amount of such excess  limits  of
 liability,  any  defenses  which it may be entitled to plead against the
 insured. Any such policy may further provide for the  prorating  of  the
 insurance  thereunder with other applicable valid and collectible insur-
 ance. If the death, insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured shall  occur
 within  the  policy  period,  the policy during the unexpired portion of
 such period shall cover the legal representatives  of  the  insured.  No
 statement  made by the insured or on his behalf, and no violation of the
 terms of the policy, shall operate to defeat or avoid the policy  so  as
 to  bar  recovery  within the limits provided in subdivision (b) of this
 section.
  § 30. Subdivision 2 of section 353 of the vehicle and traffic  law  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (2) In the event the person who has given proof of financial responsi-
 bility  surrenders  his  operator's or chauffeur's license, registration
 certificates and  registration  plates  to  the  commissioner,  but  the
 commissioner  shall  not  release such proof in the event any action for
 damages upon a liability referred to in this article is then pending, or
 any judgment upon any such liability then outstanding  and  unsatisfied,
 or  in  the  event the commissioner has received notice that such person
 has within  the  period  of  three  months  immediately  preceding  been
 involved  as a driver in any motor vehicle [accident] CRASH.  An affida-
 vit of the applicant of the non-existence of such facts shall be  suffi-
 cient evidence thereof in the absence of evidence to the contrary in the
 records of the bureau.
 A. 3839  16
 
  §  31. Section 354 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by chap-
 ter 61 of the laws of 1989, is amended to read as follows:
  § 354. Commissioner  to  furnish  operating  record.  The commissioner
 shall upon request furnish  any  insurance  carrier  or  any  person  an
 abstract of the operating record of any person subject to the provisions
 of  this  article,  which  abstract  shall  include  enumeration  of any
 convictions of such person of a violation of any provision of any  stat-
 ute  relating  to  the  operation  of a motor vehicle or any [accidents]
 CRASHES in which a motor vehicle driven by such person has been involved
 during the current calendar year and the three calendar years  preceding
 that  in  which  the request for the operating record is received and if
 specifically requested shall also fully designate the motor vehicles, if
 any, registered in the name of such person and the name of  the  insurer
 insuring  such  motor  vehicle,  for  the registration year in which the
 request for the operating record is received. A request for an  abstract
 of an operating record shall be subject to the provisions of section two
 hundred two of this chapter.
  § 32. Section 366 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 366. Past application of article. This article, except section three
 hundred  thirty-nine  [thereof]  OF THIS ARTICLE, shall not apply to any
 judgment in a civil action or cause of action arising out of  [an  acci-
 dent] A CRASH occurring prior to the effective date of this article.

  Indemnity bonds or insurance policies; notice of [accident] CRASH.
  Every person, firm, association or corporation engaged in the business
 of carrying or transporting passengers for hire in any motor vehicle  or

 corporate surety bond or a policy of insurance, approved as to  form  by
 the  superintendent  of financial services in a company authorized to do
 business in the state, approved by the superintendent as to solvency and
 responsibility, conditioned for the payment of a minimum sum, hereinaft-
 er called minimum liability, on a judgment  or  judgments  for  damages,
 including damages for care and loss of services, because of bodily inju-
 ry  to,  or  death  of  any  one person in any one [accident] CRASH, and
 subject to such minimum liability  a  maximum  sum,  hereinafter  called
 maximum  liability  on  a  judgment  or judgments for damages, including
 damages for care and loss of services because of bodily  injury  to,  or

 ratably  among  the  judgment creditors according to the amount of their
 A. 3839  17
 
 respective judgments for damage or injury caused in the operation, main-
 tenance, use or the defective construction  of  such  motor  vehicle  or
 motorcycle as follows:
  3.  A person, firm, association or corporation engaged in the business
 of renting or leasing rental vehicles to be  operated  upon  the  public
 highways  for  carrying passengers shall be subject to the provisions of
 this section in the same manner and  to  the  same  extent  as  if  such
 person,  firm,  association  or corporation were actually engaged in the
 business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this  section,  a
 person,  firm,  association  or  corporation  engaged in the business of
 renting or leasing motor vehicles, having registered in this state  more
 than  twenty-five  motor  vehicles  subject  to  the  provisions of this
 section and who qualifies as hereinafter provided, may  file  a  certif-
 icate  of  self-insurance.  The  commissioner  of  motor vehicles in his
 discretion may, upon the application of such a person, firm, association

 ordinance making it unlawful to leave the scene of [an accident] A CRASH
 without reporting;
  § 59. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 510-a of  the  vehicle
 and  traffic law, as amended by section 1 of part C of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  (a) A serious traffic violation  shall  mean  operating  a  commercial
 motor  vehicle in violation of any provision of this chapter or the laws
 or ordinances of any other state or locality outside of this state  that
 restricts  or  prohibits  the  use  of a hand-held mobile telephone or a
 portable electronic device while operating a commercial motor vehicle or
 in violation of any provision of this chapter or the laws of  any  other
 state,  the  District  of  Columbia  or  any Canadian province which (i)
 limits the speed of motor  vehicles,  provided  the  violation  involved
 fifteen or more miles per hour over the established speed limit; (ii) is
 defined  as  reckless driving by state or local law or regulation; (iii)
 prohibits improper or erratic lane change; (iv) prohibits following  too
 closely;  (v)  relates  to  motor  vehicle  traffic (other than parking,
 standing or stopping) and which arises in connection with a fatal [acci-
 dent] CRASH; (vi) operating a commercial  motor  vehicle  without  first

  § 60. Section 520 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by  chap-
 ter 607 of the laws of 1979, is amended to read as follows:
  § 520. Statement  of findings and declaration of purpose. The ever-in-
 creasing number of [accidents] CRASHES,  personal  injuries  and  deaths
 resulting  from  alcohol or drug-related traffic offenses is a matter of
 great concern to the legislature. The diminished perception  of  intoxi-
 cated  and  impaired operators of motor vehicles presents a constant and
 intolerable threat to the lives and well-being of the  citizens  of  the
 state.  Efforts aimed at alleviating this threat have proven inadequate.
 The public interest in the cause of highway safety will be  well  served
 by the implementation of a permanent program of rehabilitation for those
 operators  convicted  of  alcohol  or  drug-related traffic offenses and
 certain operators who have been adjudicated youthful offenders for alco-
 hol or drug-related traffic offenses. The commissioner of motor vehicles
 should have the authority to offer to such operators an opportunity  for
 rehabilitation,  thereby reducing the threat aimed at themselves and the
 people of the state.
  § 61. Section 523-b of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by  chap-
 ter 596 of the laws of 1975, is amended to read as follows:

  § 523-b. Experimental  driver  safety  programs.  The commissioner may
 study the feasibility of programs to improve driver behavior,  attitude,
 performance or skills in order to reduce motor vehicle [accidents] CRAS-
 HES and traffic violations, and to promote highway safety. He shall have
 the  authority  to  establish  such  programs on a limited, experimental
 basis in order to assist in such feasibility  study  provided  any  such
 program  is  funded by any source other than state funds, or if any such
 program is to be funded with state funds, then  he  may  establish  such
 program  only  with  the approval of the director of the division of the
 budget.
  § 62. The article heading of article 22 of the vehicle and traffic law
 is amended to read as follows:

 hundred  fifty  dollars  or a sentence of imprisonment for up to fifteen
 days or both such fine and imprisonment.

 the foregoing provisions of this chapter, shall immediately  investigate
 the  facts,  or cause the same to be investigated, and report the matter
 to the commissioner forthwith; provided, however, that the report of the
 [accident] CRASH is made to the police officer or judicial officer with-
 in five days after such [accident] CRASH. Every coroner, or other  offi-

 A. 3839  27
 
 permit.  Such report shall distinctly indicate and  include  information
 as  to  whether  the  inflatable restraint system inflated and deployed.
 Nothing contained in this subdivision shall  be  deemed  to  preclude  a
 police  officer  from reporting any other [accident] CRASH which, in the
 judgment of such police officer, would be required to be reported to the
 commissioner by the operator  of  a  vehicle  pursuant  to  section  six
 hundred five of this article.
  2. In addition to the requirements of subdivision one of this section,
 every  police  officer or judicial officer to whom [an accident] A CRASH
 shall have been reported involving a commercial vehicle  as  defined  in
 either subdivision four of section five hundred one-a or subdivision one
 of  section five hundred nine-p of this chapter shall immediately inves-
 tigate the facts, or cause the same to be investigated  and  report  the
 matter  to  the  commissioner forthwith, provided that the report of the
 [accident] CRASH is made to the police officer or judicial officer with-
 in five days after such [accident] CRASH, whenever such [accident] CRASH
 has resulted in (i) a vehicle being  towed  from  the  [accident]  CRASH
 scene  as  the result of incurring disabling damage, (ii) a fatality, or
 (iii) any individual being transported to a medical facility to  receive
 treatment  as  the result of physical injury sustained in the [accident]
 CRASH.
  § 66. Section 603-a of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by  chap-

 ous physical injury or death to a  person,  and  such  [accident]  CRASH
 either  is discovered by a police officer, or reported to a police offi-
 cer within five days after such [accident] CRASH  occurred,  the  police

  (a) Such investigation shall be conducted for the purposes of making a
 determination  of  the  following:  the  facts  and circumstances of the
 [accident] CRASH; the type or  types  of  vehicles  involved,  including
 passenger motor vehicles, commercial motor vehicles, motorcycles, limit-
 ed  use  motorcycles,  off-highway motorcycles, and/or bicycles; whether
 pedestrians were involved; the contributing factor or  factors;  whether
 it  can  be  determined  if  a  violation  or violations of this chapter
 occurred, and if so, the specific provisions of this chapter which  were
 violated  and  by  whom;  and, the cause of such [accident] CRASH, where
 such cause can be determined.
  (b) When present at the scene of such [accident] CRASH,  the  investi-
 gating  officer  shall also request that all operators of motor vehicles
 involved in such [accident] CRASH submit to field testing as defined  in
 section  eleven  hundred  ninety-four of this chapter provided there are
 reasonable grounds to believe such motor vehicle  operator  committed  a
 serious  traffic violation in the same [accident] CRASH.  The results of
 such field testing or refusal of such testing shall be included  in  the
 police  investigation report. For the purposes of this section, "serious
 traffic violation" shall mean operating a motor vehicle in violation  of

 of  this  article and subdivision twelve of section eleven hundred nine-
 ty-two of this chapter, in every case where a law enforcement officer is
 required to report pursuant to section six hundred three of this article
 and a person is charged with a violation of this chapter arising out  of
 such  [accident] CRASH, the law enforcement officer alleging such charge
 shall make a clear notation in the "Description of Violation" section of
 a simplified traffic information, or in an area provided  on  a  summons
 and  complaint  pursuant to subdivision one of section two hundred twen-
 ty-six of this chapter, if, arising out of the  same  [accident]  CRASH,
 someone  other  than  the  person charged was killed or suffered serious
 physical injury as defined in section 10.00 of the penal law; such nota-
 tion shall be in the form of a "D" if  someone  other  than  the  person
 charged  was killed and such notation shall be in the form of a "S.P.I."
 if someone other than the person charged suffered serious physical inju-
 ry; provided however, that the failure to make such notation shall in no
 way affect a charge for a violation of this chapter.

 operating a motor vehicle, except a police officer (as defined in subdi-
 vision thirty-four of section 1.20 of the  criminal  procedure  law),  a
 correction  officer,  or a firefighter, operating a police department, a
 correction department, or fire department vehicle respectively while  on
 duty,  if a report has been filed by the owner of such vehicle, which is
 A. 3839  29
 
 in any manner involved in [an accident] A  CRASH,  anywhere  within  the
 boundaries  of  this state, in which any person is killed or injured, or
 in which damage to the property of any one person, including himself, in
 excess of one thousand dollars is sustained, shall within ten days after
 such [accident] CRASH, report the matter in writing to the commissioner.
 If  such  operator  or  chauffeur be physically incapable of making such
 report and there be another participant  in  the  [accident]  CRASH  not
 incapacitated,  such  participant shall make such report within ten days
 after such [accident] CRASH. If the operator or  chauffeur  involved  in
 such  [accident]  CRASH  be unable to make such report, the owner of the
 motor vehicle involved in such [accident] CRASH, if such  owner  be  not
 involved  in  such  [accident]  CRASH or incapacitated, shall within ten
 days after he learns of the fact of such  [accident]  CRASH  report  the
 matter  to  the  commissioner together with such information as may have
 come to his knowledge relating to  such  [accident]  CRASH.  Every  such
 operator  or  chauffeur  of  a motor vehicle, or participant in any such
 [accident] CRASH, or owner of the motor vehicle  involved  in  any  such
 [accident]  CRASH,  shall  make such other and additional reports as the
 commissioner shall require.
  2. Failure to report an [accident] CRASH as herein provided or failure
 to give correctly the information required of him by the commissioner in
 connection with such report shall be a misdemeanor and shall  constitute
 a ground for suspension or revocation of the operator's (or chauffeur's)
 license or all certificates of registration for any motor vehicle, or of
 both,  of  the person failing to make such report as herein required. In
 addition, the commissioner may temporarily suspend the driver's  license
 or  permit  or certificate of registration of the motor vehicle involved
 in the [accident] CRASH, or of both, of the person failing to report [an
 accident] A CRASH within the period prescribed in paragraph one of  this
 subdivision, until such report has been filed. However, no suspension or
 a  revocation  shall be made of a license or certificate of registration
 of any police officer, correction officer, or  firefighter  involved  in
 [an  accident]  A  CRASH while on duty for failure to report such [acci-
 dent] CRASH within ten days thereof if a report has been  filed  by  the
 owner of such vehicle.
  3. In the case of a non-resident the failure to report [an accident] A
 CRASH as herein provided shall constitute ground for suspension or revo-
 cation  of his privileges of operating a motor vehicle in this state and
 of the operation within this state of any motor vehicle owned by him.
  4. When a report required by this section is made by an  owner  or  an
 operator  of a fire vehicle, as defined by section one hundred fifteen-a
 of this chapter, or a police vehicle, as defined by section one  hundred
 thirty-two-a of this chapter, when such [accident] CRASH occurred during
 the  operation  of  such  vehicle  in response to an emergency where the
 operator was responding to a call to duty as a paid or volunteer  member
 of  any  fire  department, or in the case of a police vehicle, when such
 [accident] CRASH occurred during  emergency  operation,  as  defined  by
 section  one  hundred fourteen-b of this chapter, the commissioner shall
 omit the event described in such report  from  the  operator's  external
 license  abstract.  Provided, however, the commissioner shall not omit
 the event described in such report from the operator's external  license
 abstract  if as a result of such event such operator has either (i) been
 charged with a violation of this chapter or of the penal law, unless the
 commissioner receives evidence that such charge has been  dismissed,  or
 that  the  action  has otherwise been terminated in favor of the accused
 pursuant to section 160.50 of the criminal procedure law,  or  that  the
 A. 3839  30
 
 charge  has  otherwise  been  adjudicated  in an administrative or other
 proceeding in favor of the defendant operator or (ii) been found to have
 been grossly negligent by a final order of a court of  competent  juris-
 diction.
  (b)  Every  person operating a bicycle which is in any manner involved
 in [an accident] A CRASH on a public highway in this state in which  any
 person  is  killed, other than the operator, or suffers serious physical
 injury as defined pursuant to subdivision ten of section  10.00  of  the
 penal  law, shall within ten days after such operator learns of the fact
 of such death or serious physical injury, report the matter  in  writing
 to  the commissioner. If such operator is physically incapable of making
 such report within ten days, he or she shall make the report immediately
 upon recovery from the physical  incapacity.  If  such  operator  is  an
 unemancipated  minor  who  is  incapable  of  making such report for any
 reason, the parent or guardian of such operator shall make  such  report
 within  ten  days  after  learning of the fact of such [accident] CRASH.
 Every such operator of a bicycle, or parent or guardian of such  uneman-
 cipated  minor operator, shall make such other and additional reports as
 the commissioner shall require.
  (c) The report required by this section shall be made in such form and
 number as the commissioner may  prescribe.  Such  report  shall  include
 information  on  the  width and length of trucks, tractors, trailers and
 semitrailers, which are in excess of  ninety-five  inches  in  width  or
 thirty-four  feet  in  length and which are involved in such [accidents]
 CRASHES, whether such [accident] CRASH took place in  a  work  area  and
 whether  it  was  being  operated  with  an overweight or over dimension
 permit. Such report shall distinctly indicate and include information as
 to whether the inflatable restraint system inflated and deployed.

 the extent permitted under  this  chapter  for  physical  or  mechanical
 damage  to  the  rental  vehicle  that occurs during the time the rental
 vehicle is under the rental agreement; provided, however, that a  renter
 shall  not  be  liable  for mechanical damage unrelated to an [accident]
 CRASH, nor for any normal wear and tear or other mechanical damage  that
 could  reasonably  be expected from normal use of the vehicle, except in
 instances where abuse or  neglect  by  the  driver  is  shown.  For  the
 purposes  of  this subdivision, "actual and reasonable costs" shall mean
 the repair price reduced by all discounts paid  by  the  rental  vehicle
 company  to  the  repairer  of  the vehicle, including costs for towing,
 storage, and impound fees.

 amended by section 19 of part III of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019  and
 paragraph 2 as separately amended by chapters 547 and 568 of the laws of
 1997, are amended to read as follows:
  (1)  No  policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed
 by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising
 out of the ownership, maintenance and use  of  a  motor  vehicle  or  an
 altered  motor  vehicle  commonly  referred  to as a "stretch limousine"
 having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in the  busi-
 ness  of  carrying  or  transporting passengers for hire, by the insured
 shall be issued or delivered by any authorized insurer  upon  any  motor
 vehicle  or  an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a "stretch
 limousine" having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in
 the business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire, then prin-
 cipally garaged or principally used in this state unless it  contains  a
 provision whereby the insurer agrees that it will pay to the insured, as
 defined in such provision, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
 therein  to be prescribed by the board of directors of the Motor Vehicle
 [Accident] CRASH Indemnification Corporation and approved by the  super-
 intendent,  all sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of twenty-
 five thousand dollars exclusive of interest and  costs,  on  account  of
 injury to and all sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of fifty
 thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs, on account of death of
 one  person,  in  any  one  [accident]  CRASH, and the maximum amount or
 limit, subject to such limit for any one  person  so  injured  of  fifty
 thousand dollars or so killed of one hundred thousand dollars, exclusive
 of  interest  and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, more than
 one person in any one [accident] CRASH, which the insured or  his  legal
 representative  shall be entitled to recover as damages from an owner or
 operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, unidentified motor vehicle which
 leaves the scene of [an accident] A CRASH, a motor vehicle registered in
 this state as to which at the time of the [accident] CRASH there was not
 in effect a policy of liability insurance, a  stolen  vehicle,  a  motor
 vehicle operated without permission of the owner, an insured motor vehi-
 cle  where  the  insurer  disclaims  liability  or denies coverage or an
 unregistered vehicle because of  bodily  injury,  sickness  or  disease,
 A. 3839  39
 
 including death resulting therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by
 [accident] A CRASH occurring in this state and arising out of the owner-
 ship,  maintenance or use of such motor vehicle. No payment for non-eco-
 nomic loss shall be made under such policy provision to a covered person
 unless  such  person  has  incurred  a serious injury, as such terms are
 defined in section five thousand one hundred two of this  chapter.  Such
 policy  shall  not duplicate any element of basic economic loss provided
 for under article fifty-one of this chapter. No payments of first  party
 benefits  for  basic  economic  loss made pursuant to such article shall
 diminish the obligations of the insurer under this policy provision  for
 the  payment  of  non-economic loss and economic loss in excess of basic
 economic loss.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions  of  section
 three thousand four hundred twenty-five of this article, any such policy
 which does not contain the aforesaid provisions shall be construed as if
 such provisions were embodied therein.
  (2)  (A)  Any  such  policy  shall, at the option of the insured, also
 provide supplementary  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  for
 bodily  injury, in an amount up to the bodily injury liability insurance
 limits of coverage provided under such policy, subject to a  maximum  of
 two  hundred fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death
 of one person in any one [accident] CRASH and, subject to such limit for
 one person, up to five hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury
 to or death of two or more persons in any one  [accident]  CRASH,  or  a
 combined single limit policy of five hundred thousand dollars because of
 bodily  injury  to or death of one or more persons in any one [accident]
 CRASH; and any such policy insuring against loss resulting from  liabil-
 ity  imposed  by  law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural
 person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, and use of an  altered
 motor  vehicle  commonly  referred  to as a "stretch limousine" having a
 seating capacity of eight or more passengers used  in  the  business  of
 carrying or transporting passengers for hire, shall provide supplementa-
 ry  uninsured/underinsured  motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an
 amount of a combined single limit of one million five  hundred  thousand
 dollars  because of bodily injury or death of one or more persons in any
 one [accident] CRASH.  Provided however, an insurer  issuing  any  such
 policy,  except  a policy insuring against loss resulting from liability
 imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person
 arising out of the ownership, maintenance, and use of an  altered  motor
 vehicle  commonly  referred to as a "stretch limousine" having a seating
 capacity of eight or more passengers used in the business of carrying or
 transporting passengers for hire, in lieu of offering to the insured the
 coverages stated above, may provide supplementary uninsured/underinsured
 motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an amount  up  to  the  bodily
 injury  liability insurance limits of coverage provided under such poli-
 cy, subject to a maximum of one  hundred  thousand  dollars  because  of
 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one [accident] CRASH and,
 subject  to  such  limit  for  one  person, up to three hundred thousand
 dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more  persons  in
 any  one  [accident]  CRASH,  or a combined single limit policy of three
 hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one  or
 more  persons  in  any  one [accident] CRASH, if such insurer also makes
 available a personal umbrella policy with liability coverage  limits  up
 to  at  least five hundred thousand dollars which also provides coverage
 for supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists claims. Supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance shall  provide  coverage,  in
 any  state  or  Canadian  province, if the limits of liability under all
 A. 3839  40
 
 bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies  of  another  motor
 vehicle liable for damages are in a lesser amount than the bodily injury
 liability  insurance  limits  of  coverage provided by such policy. Upon
 written  request  by  any  insured  covered  by  supplemental
 uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance or his duly authorized repre-
 sentative and upon disclosure by the insured  of  the  insured's  bodily
 injury  and  supplemental  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance
 coverage limits, the insurer of any other owner or operator  of  another
 motor  vehicle  against  which  a claim has been made for damages to the
 insured shall disclose, within forty-five days of the request, the bodi-
 ly injury liability insurance limits of its coverage provided under  the
 policy  or all bodily injury liability bonds. The time of the insured to
 make any supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist claim,  shall  be
 tolled  during  the period the insurer of any other owner or operator of
 another motor vehicle that may be liable for  damages  to  the  insured,
 fails to so disclose its coverage. As a condition precedent to the obli-
 gation  of  the  insurer  to  pay  under  the  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  coverage,  the  limits  of
 liability  of  all  bodily  injury liability bonds or insurance policies
 applicable at the time of the [accident] CRASH  shall  be  exhausted  by
 payment of judgments or settlements.
  (B)  In  addition to the notice provided, upon issuance of a policy of
 motor vehicle liability insurance pursuant to regulations promulgated by
 the superintendent, insurers shall notify insureds, in writing,  of  the
 availability of supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage.
 Such  notification  shall  contain  an  explanation  of  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage and the amounts  in  which  it
 can  be purchased. Subsequently, a notification of availability shall be
 provided at least once a year and may be simplified  pursuant  to  regu-
 lations  promulgated  by  the superintendent, but must include a concise
 statement that supplementary uninsured/underinsured  motorists  coverage
 is  available,  an explanation of such coverage, and the coverage limits
 that can be purchased from the insurer.
  (3) The protection provided by this subsection shall not apply to  any
 cause  of  action  by  an  insured person arising out of a motor vehicle
 [accident] CRASH occurring in this state against a person whose identity
 is unascertainable, unless the bodily injury to the insured person arose
 out of physical contact of the motor vehicle causing the injury with the
 insured person or with a motor vehicle  which  the  insured  person  was
 occupying (meaning in or upon or entering into or alighting from) at the
 time of the [accident] CRASH.
  §  97-a.  Subparagraph (A) and clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of para-
 graph 2-a of subsection (f) of section 3420 of  the  insurance  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  15  of  the  laws  of 2018, are amended to read as
 follows:
  (A) Notwithstanding paragraph two of this subsection,  this  paragraph
 shall  apply  to  any  new  insurance policy or contract subject to this
 subsection entered into after the  effective  date  of  this  paragraph.
 This  paragraph  shall not be deemed to apply to any policies originally
 entered into prior to the effective date of this paragraph, but  renewed
 after  the effective date of this paragraph, or to any policy of commer-
 cial risk insurance. Any new insurance policy or contract  entered  into
 after  the  effective date of this paragraph shall, at the option of the
 first named insured, also provide  supplementary  uninsured/underinsured
 motorists  insurance for bodily injury, in an amount equal to the bodily
 injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided under such  motor
 A. 3839  41
 
 vehicle  liability  insurance  policy;  provided,  however, that a first
 named insured may exercise the  choice  to  decline  such  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance or select a lower amount of
 coverage  through  a written waiver signed, or electronically signed, by
 such insured, subject to the requirements of subparagraph  (B)  of  this
 paragraph.  Supplementary  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance
 shall provide coverage, in any state or Canadian province, if the limits
 of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance poli-
 cies of any other motor vehicle liable  for  damages  are  in  a  lesser
 amount  than  the  bodily  injury liability insurance limits of coverage
 provided by such policy. Upon written request by any insured covered  by
 supplemental  uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  or  a  duly
 authorized representative and upon disclosure  by  the  insured  of  the
 insured's  bodily  injury and supplemental uninsured/underinsured motor-
 ists insurance coverage limits, the insurer of any other owner or opera-
 tor of another motor vehicle against which a claim  has  been  made  for
 damages  to  the  insured  shall disclose, within forty-five days of the
 request, the bodily injury liability insurance limits  of  its  coverage
 provided under the policy or all bodily injury liability bonds. The time
 of the insured to make any supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist
 claim,  shall be tolled during the period the insurer of any other owner
 or operator of another motor vehicle that may be liable for  damages  to
 the insured, fails to so disclose its coverage. As a condition precedent
 to  the  obligation  of  the  insurer  to  pay  under  the supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured  motorists  insurance  coverage,  the  limits  of
 liability  of  all  bodily  injury liability bonds or insurance policies
 applicable at the time of the [accident] CRASH  shall  be  exhausted  by
 payment of judgments or settlements.
  (i)  The  form  shall  also  advise  that  supplementary
 uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage (sum coverage) provides insur-
 ance protection for any person included as insured under your policy  if
 he  or  she  is injured in [an accident] A CRASH involving another motor
 vehicle whose owner or operator was negligent  but  who  has  either  no
 bodily  injury  or  liability  insurance, or less than the insurance you
 carry. Sum coverage shall be equal to the level  of  the  bodily  injury
 liability  coverage  of  your  motor  vehicle liability insurance policy
 unless you sign a waiver requesting  lower  coverage  or  declining  the
 coverage. You are urged to carefully consider this decision.

 inability  to  work because of personal injury arising out of the use or
 operation of a motor vehicle, is not entitled  to  receive  first  party
 benefits  for "loss of earnings from work" to the extent that such mone-

 ty-five dollars per day for not more than one year from the date of  the

 2017, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph two of this subsection, where
 there is reasonable belief more than one insurer would be the source  of
 first  party benefits, the insurers may agree among themselves, if there
 is a valid basis therefor, that one of them  will  accept  and  pay  the
 claim  initially.  If there is no such agreement, then the first insurer
 to whom notice of claim is given shall be responsible for  payment.  Any
 such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration proce-
 dures  established pursuant to section five thousand one hundred five of
 this article and regulations as promulgated by the  superintendent,  and
 any  insurer  paying  first-party  benefits shall be reimbursed by other
 insurers for their proportionate share of the costs of the claim and the
 allocated expenses of processing  the  claim,  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  entitled  "other  coverage"  contained in regulation and the
 provisions entitled "other sources of first-party benefits" contained in
 regulation. If there is no such insurer and the motor vehicle [accident]
 CRASH occurs in this state, then an applicant who is a qualified  person
 as  defined  in  article  fifty-two  of this chapter shall institute the
 claim against the motor vehicle [accident] CRASH indemnification  corpo-
 ration.
