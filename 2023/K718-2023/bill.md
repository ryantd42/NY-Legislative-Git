  COMMEMORATING the 100th Anniversary of the Reserve
  Organization of America
 
  WHEREAS, Members of our Armed Forces from the State of New York, who
have  served  so valiantly and honorably in wars in which this country's
freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of peace in  peace-
time, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to commend the
Reserve Organization of America and to pay tribute to  its  members  for
their outstanding contributions to our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
100th Anniversary of the Reserve Organization of America; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1922, the Reserve Officers Association of the  United
States,  now  known  as  the  Reserve  Organization  of America (ROA) to
reflect its all-ranks  membership,  has  championed  the  cause  of  the
Reserve Components at home and in war; and
 
  WHEREAS, The evolution of that mission has helped protect the rights
and  benefits  of  individual  members  of  the  Reserve force and their
families, while preserving a strong  and  capable  Reserve  force  as  a
critical  component to our national security; ROA continues to serve the
Reserve and National Guard in an era where the need is greater than ever
before; and
 
  WHEREAS, The founders of ROA, veterans  of  World  War  I,  believed
America  was  vulnerable  to  return  to  its  pre-war  unpreparedness;
determined to help prevent the very unreadiness  they  had  experienced,
140  officers  gathered  with General of the Armies John J. "Black Jack"
Pershing at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.,  and  on  October  2,
1922, formally established ROA; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the political and national security context changed over
a  century,  ROA  has  remained  steadfastly  committed  to its original
mission to support and assist in the  development  and  execution  of  a
military  policy  for  the  United  States  which shall provide adequate
National Defense; and
 
  WHEREAS, Between the world wars, through  the  Cold  War,  into  the
current  era, and throughout shifting political influences, ROA has been
a prominent voice in the cause of preparedness; and
 
  WHEREAS, The association's earliest campaign was for a strong  corps
of  Reserve  officers  who could help the nation rebuild its Army should
the need arise; and
 
  WHEREAS, The farsighted vision and tenacity of  these  WWI  veterans
laid  the  foundation  for  the  success of the Army's massive growth to
defeat tyranny in Europe and Asia; and
 
  WHEREAS, President Harry S. Truman, one of ROA's early members and a
combat veteran of WWI who served in both the Army National Guard and the
Army Reserve, signed the charter on June 30, 1950; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  founding  and  earning  its  charter,  ROA has
effectively advocated on behalf  of  all  members  of  the  Reserve  and
National Guard; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  100  years  ROA has been the only organization solely
dedicated to supporting the Reserve Components and their  critical  role
in national defense; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  focus  on  support  of the Reserve and Guard, ROA
promotes the interests of Reserve Component members, their families, and
veterans of Reserve service, and conducts a legislative  campaign  which
ensures the readiness of our Reserve force; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  ROA  provides the tools, resources, support,
education, and advocacy Reservists and their families need  to  succeed,
in and out of uniform; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Reserve Organization of America and the Department of
New York Reserve Organization of America are the  only  all  ranks,  all
services,  military  service  organization  for the Reserve and National
Guard, also known as the Reserve components, in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, this vital organization leads the  nation's  efforts
to  ensure  the  Reserve  Components  are  strong and ready, and Reserve
Component families are well cared for; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  100th  Anniversary  of  the  Reserve  Organization  of
America is a living testament to its indomitable heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through its long and sustained commitment to the ideals and
principles upon which this beloved Nation was first founded, the Reserve
Organization  of  America has unselfishly advanced that spirit of united
purpose and shared concern which is the unalterable manifestation of our
American experience; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Reserve  Organization of America on its 100th Anniversary,
and to pay tribute to its members for their outstanding contributions to
our Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Reserve Organization of America.
