 Introduced  by M. of A. MAMDANI -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Banks
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law and the banking law,  in  relation  to
  establishing the banking bill of rights
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent. Across New York, financial institutions
 terminate individuals' bank accounts or deny their applications with  no
 reason  provided or recourse allowed. These banking practices dispropor-
 tionately impact immigrant communities, resulting in unbanked or  under-
 banked  New  Yorkers.  Such  practices harm consumers' credit scores and
 histories, creating barriers to housing, education  and  access  to  the
 financial  industry  altogether;  they also block millions of dollars of
 donations to charitable organizations.  Furthermore,  these  unfair  and
 discriminatory  practices  create  a  chilling effect on local economies
 statewide. Personal finance deserves due process, and it is  the  intent
 of  the  legislature  to  ensure  fundamental banking rights for all New
 Yorkers. Requiring financial institutions to disclose  the  reasons  for
 adverse actions with respect to credit and deposit accounts will prevent
 discrimination  ex  ante, in addition to giving consumers an opportunity
 to improve their credit or financial status and  rectify  mistakes  that
 may  occur  from  misinformation or inadequate information; it will also
 create a beneficial competitive effect on the financial industry.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a  new  section  296-b  to
 read as follows:
  §  296-B.  BANKING BILL OF RIGHTS. 1. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF
