  COMMENDING  the  Ancient  Egyptian  Arabic  Order
  Nobles  Mystic  Shrine  upon  the  occasion  of
  celebrating Jubilee Day on June 4, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine upon the
occasion of celebrating Jubilee Day on Sunday, June 4, 2023,  at  Queens
Baptist Church in Queens Village, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  history  of  Jubilee  Day began in August 1914 with a
lawsuit against the Order, which ended in a  historic  decision  by  The
United States Supreme Court on June 3, 1929; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  lawsuit  attempted  to  deprive  the Ancient Egyptian
Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine of the right to work and be recognized
as Shriners; it also extended those implications to all appending Prince
Hall Masons established in the United States of America; and
 
  WHEREAS, The nine Supreme Court Justices' unanimous decision  upheld
the  rights  of  this  vital  organization's  members  to  work  and  be
recognized as Shriners; it also legitimized Prince Hall Masonry in  this
country,  including  other  Fraternal  Orders composed of black members,
which are of organizations, doctrine, and purpose as those consisting of
white members; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Nobles of Elejmal Temple No. 185, Abu Bekr  Temple  No.
91, and Al Maseer Temple No. 251 will commemorate Jubilee Day on Sunday,
June  4,  2023,  to  the  memory of that historic decision of the United
States Supreme Court on June 3, 1929, and dedicate this service to those
members of the Order who have given unselfishly of  their  substance  to
the end which justice prevailed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Worldwide Fraternal Shrine Family has a membership of
approximately 35,000 in some 227 Shrine  Temples  and  200  Courts,  its
women's  auxiliary,  the  Daughters  of Isis, throughout the Continental
United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, England,  Spain,  Hawaii,  Japan,
Korea, Guam, Thailand, Panama, and the Bahamas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Ancient  Egyptian  Arabic  Order Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine  is  primarily  a  benevolent,  charitable,  and  fraternal
organization;  its dedicated membership is committed to fostering civic,
economic, and educational development programs worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within the Desert of  New  York,  there  consist  of  eight
Temples, Medina No. 19 in New York City, Hadji No. 61 in Buffalo, Aleppo
No.  88  in  Syracuse, Abu Bekr No. 91 in Brooklyn, Al Tabari No. 121 in
 
Albany, Elejmal No. 185 in Ossining, Nyla No. 238 in Watertown,  and  Al
Maseer No.  251 in Amityville; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The success of Doric Lodge No. 53 is in direct correlation
to the efforts of its devoted members, whose involvement is, and  always
has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the  members  of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine,
past and present, who have labored  so  conscientiously  to  secure  and
improve the quality of life for the community it serves; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine upon  the
occasion of celebrating Jubilee Day on June 4, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine.
