 AN ACT to amend the public service law, in relation to the  finality  of
  certain utility charges and the contents of utility bills
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 41 of the public service  law,  as
 added by chapter 713 of the laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no utility corporation
 or municipality [may] SHALL charge a residential  customer  for  gas  or
 electric  service which was rendered more than [six] TWO months prior to
 the mailing of the first bill to the customer for  such  service  unless
 the  failure  of  the corporation or municipality to bill sooner was not
 due to the neglect of the corporation or municipality or was due to  the
 culpable  conduct  of  the  customer. If the customer remains liable for
 such service, the utility shall permit payments  to  be  made  under  an
 installment payment plan, provided, however, that the utility or munici-
 pality  may  require prompt payment if the non-billing resulted from the
 culpable conduct of the customer. Any such installment payment plan  may
 provide  for a downpayment of up to one-half of the amounts due from the
 customer, or three months average billing, whichever is less.
  § 2. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 41-a to
 read as follows:
  § 41-A. FINALITY OF CHARGES; NON-RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  NOTWITHSTAND-
 ING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, NO UTILITY CORPORATION  OR  MUNICIPALITY
 SHALL  CHARGE  A  NON-RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMER  FOR GAS OR ELECTRIC SERVICE
 WHICH WAS RENDERED MORE THAN TWO MONTHS PRIOR  TO  THE  MAILING  OF  THE
 FIRST  BILL  TO  THE CUSTOMER FOR SUCH SERVICE UNLESS THE FAILURE OF THE
 CORPORATION OR MUNICIPALITY TO BILL SOONER WAS NOT DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 CONDUCT OF THE CUSTOMER.
  §  3.  Section 44 of the public service law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 7 to read as follows:
  7. AS PART OF EVERY BILLING, THE UTILITY CORPORATION  OR  MUNICIPALITY
 SHALL PROVIDE BOTH IN GRAPH AND WRITTEN FORM, FOR THE PRIOR TWO YEARS OF
 THE  CUSTOMER  OR  THE  PRIOR CUSTOMERS AT THE SAME ADDRESS, THE MONTHLY
 USAGE OF THE CUSTOMER, THE MONTHLY  UNIT  CHARGES  FOR  USAGE,  AND  THE
 MONTHLY  BILLING  CHARGE  AMOUNT TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS REQUIREMENT SHALL
 APPLY TO BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing the date upon which it shall have become a law.
