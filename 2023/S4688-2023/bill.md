  (c)  [(A)]  (I) Discretionary release on parole shall [not] be granted
 [merely as a reward] for good conduct [or] AND efficient performance  of
 duties  while  confined  [but after considering if there is a reasonable
 probability], AND FOR PREPAREDNESS FOR REENTRY  AND  REINTEGRATION  INTO
 SOCIETY  THEREBY  PROVIDING A REASONABLE BASIS TO CONCLUDE that, if such
 incarcerated individual is released, he or she will live and  remain  at
 liberty without violating the law, and THEREFORE that his or her release
 is  not incompatible with the welfare of society [and will not so depre-
 cate the seriousness of his or her crime as  to  undermine  respect  for
 law].  In  making  the  parole  release decision, the procedures adopted
 pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this
 article shall require that the [following  be  considered]  DECISION  BE
 BASED  UPON THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS:  [(i) the institutional record

 TION, TRAINING OR WORK ASSIGNMENTS, THERAPY AND INTERACTIONS WITH  STAFF

 ITY, CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION; [(ii)] (B) performance,  if  any,  as  a
 participant  in  a  temporary release program; [(iii)] (C) release plans

 government  against the [incarcerated individual] PAROLE APPLICANT while
 in the custody of the department and any recommendation regarding depor-
 tation made by the commissioner of the department  pursuant  to  section
 one  hundred forty-seven of the correction law; [(v)] (E) any current or
 prior statement, WHETHER SUPPORTIVE OR CRITICAL, made to  the  board  by
 the  crime victim or the victim's representative, where the crime victim
 is deceased or is mentally or physically incapacitated,  TO  ASSIST  THE
 BOARD  IN  DETERMINING WHETHER AT THIS TIME THERE IS REASONABLE CAUSE TO
 S. 4688  5
 
 BELIEVE THAT THE RELEASE OF THE PAROLE APPLICANT WOULD CREATE A  PRESENT
 DANGER  TO  THE  VICTIM OR THE VICTIM'S REPRESENTATIVE, OR THE EXTENT OF
 THE PAROLE APPLICANT'S PREPAREDNESS FOR REENTRY AND REINTEGRATION AS SET
 FORTH  IN  CLAUSE (A) OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH; [(vi)] (F) the length of the
 determinate sentence to  which  the  incarcerated  individual  would  be
 subject  had  he or she received a sentence pursuant to section 70.70 or

 hundred  twenty  or  article  two  hundred  twenty-one of the penal law;

 of sentence, length of sentence and recommendations  of  the  sentencing
 court, the district attorney, the attorney for the incarcerated individ-
 ual,  the  pre-sentence probation report as well as consideration of any
 mitigating and aggravating  factors,  and  activities  following  arrest
 prior  to  confinement;  and (viii) prior criminal record, including the
 nature and pattern of offenses, adjustment to any previous probation  or
 parole  supervision and institutional confinement] (G) PARTICIPATION AND
 PERFORMANCE,  IF  ANY,  IN  A  RECONCILIATION/RESTORATIVE  JUSTICE-TYPE
 CONFERENCE WITH THE VICTIM OR VICTIM'S REPRESENTATIVES; (H) THE PROGRESS
 MADE  TOWARDS THE COMPLETION OF THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS PREVIOUSLY SET
 FORTH BY THE BOARD FOR THE PAROLE APPLICANT, IN THE CASE OF A  REAPPEAR-
 ANCE;  AND  (I)  THE PROGRESS MADE TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE PROGRAMMING AND
 TREATMENT NEEDS DEVELOPED IN THE TRANSITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN.  The
 board shall provide toll free telephone access for crime victims. In the
 case  of  an  oral  statement made in accordance with subdivision one of
 section 440.50 of the criminal procedure law, the  parole  board  member
 shall  present  a written report of the statement to the parole board. A
 crime victim's representative shall mean  [the  crime  victim's  closest
 surviving  relative]  A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OR DOMESTIC PARTNER OF SUCH

 victim or victim's representative  may  include  information  concerning
 threatening  or  intimidating  conduct  toward  the victim, the victim's
 representative, or the victim's family, made by the person sentenced and
 occurring after the sentencing. Such information may include,  but  need
 not  be limited to, the threatening or intimidating conduct of any other
 person who or which is directed by the person sentenced.  Any  statement
 by  a  victim  or the victim's representative made to the board shall be
 maintained by the department in the file  provided  to  the  board  when
 interviewing  the incarcerated individual in consideration of release. A
 victim or victim's representative who has submitted a written request to

 such transcript as soon as it becomes available.
  [(B)]  (II) Where a crime victim or victim's representative as defined
 in subparagraph [(A)] (I) of this paragraph, or other person submits  to
 the  parole  board  a  written  statement  concerning the release of [an
 incarcerated individual] A PAROLE APPLICANT, the parole board shall keep
 that individual's name and address confidential.  WITH  REGARD  TO  ANY
 STATEMENT  FROM  A  JUDGE OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THE ADDRESS, IF RESIDEN-
 TIAL, SHALL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL BY THE BOARD.

 it shall have become a law; provided that the  amendments  to  paragraph
 (a)  of  subdivision  2  of  section  259-i of the executive law made by
