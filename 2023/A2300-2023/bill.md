 follows:
  d.  Such  treatment  may  be rendered by a licensed physical therapist
 [for ten visits or thirty days, whichever shall occur first,] without  a
 referral  from  a  physician, dentist, podiatrist, nurse practitioner or
 licensed midwife provided that:
  (1) [The licensed physical therapist has practiced physical therapy on
 a full time basis equivalent to not less than three years.] THE PHYSICAL
 THERAPIST WILL REFER THE PATIENT TO  THE  APPROPRIATE  LICENSED  PROFES-
 SIONAL  IF SYMPTOMS ARE PRESENT OF WHICH PHYSICAL THERAPY IS CONTRAINDI-
 CATED OR WHICH SYMPTOMS ARE INDICATIVE OF CONDITIONS FOR WHICH TREATMENT
 IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE PRACTICE OF PHYSICAL THERAPY;
  (2)  IF THE PATIENT HAS A PRIMARY  CARE  LICENSED  PROVIDER  OR  OTHER
 TREATING  PHYSICIAN,  THE  PHYSICAL  THERAPIST PROVIDES ONGOING COMMUNI-
 CATION WITH THAT PROFESSIONAL DURING THE COURSE OF TREATMENT; AND
  (3) Each physical therapist licensed pursuant to  this  article  shall
 provide  written  notice  to  each  patient receiving treatment absent a

 patient's health care plan or insurer without such a referral  and  that
 such treatment may be a covered expense if rendered pursuant to a refer-
 ral.  The  physical  therapist  shall  keep  on  file with the patient's
 records a form attesting to the patient's notice of  such  advice.  Such
