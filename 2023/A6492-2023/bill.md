 AN ACT to authorize the village of Dobbs  Ferry  to  offer  an  optional
  twenty-year  retirement  plan  to  a  certain  police officer formerly
  employed by such village

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Gabriel  Bonilla,  a  member  of the New York state and local police and
 fire retirement system, who is currently employed by Westchester county,
 who was employed as a police officer with the  village  of  Dobbs  Ferry
 from  December of 2005 through March 20, 2011, and who, through no fault
 of his own, failed to file a timely application to  participate  in  the
 special  twenty-year  retirement  plan contained in section 384-d of the
 retirement and social security law, shall be given full  credit  in  the
 special  twenty-year  retirement  plan contained in section 384-d of the
 retirement and social security law for such service upon the election of
 Dobbs Ferry to assume the additional cost of such service.  The  village
 of  Dobbs  Ferry  may  so elect by filing with the state comptroller, no
 later than one year from the effective date of this act, a resolution of
 its local legislative body together with certification that such  police
 officer  did  not bar himself from participation in such retirement plan
 as a result of his own negligence. Thereafter, such police  officer  may
 elect to be covered by the provisions of section 384-d of the retirement
 and  social  security  law, and shall be entitled to the full rights and
 benefits associated with  coverage  under  such  section,  by  filing  a
 request to that effect with the state comptroller no later than one year
 from the effective date of this act.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the village of Dobbs Ferry.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would grant Gabriel Bonilla, a Tier 2 member of the New York
 State  and  Local  Police and Fire Retirement System, additional service
 creditable under the provisions of section 384-d of the  Retirement  and
 Social  Security  Law  (RSSL) for time worked as a police officer of the
 Village of Dobbs Ferry. Such service is currently creditable in the  age
 55  retirement  plan of section 375-i of the RSSL but not in the 20-year
 plan of section 384-d. Gabriel Bonilla  is  currently  employed  by  the
 County of Westchester.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $114,000  which
 will  be borne by the Village of Dobbs Ferry as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  This bill will not increase the future  annual  contributions  of  the
 County of Westchester.
