 Introduced  by  M.  of A. COLTON -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. COOK,
  GLICK -- read once and referred  to  the  Committee  on  Environmental

 AN  ACT  to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to the
  filling of borrow pits in Gravesend Bay; and providing for the  repeal
  of such provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. Due to the increase in vessel  size  in
 recent  years, New York State waterways such as channels, berthing areas
 and harbors are being excavated in a process known as dredging to  main-
 tain sufficient depth for safe and efficient vessel operation.
  Dredged  material  is  naturally  accumulated  sediment,  much  of the
 dredged material does  contain  some  contaminants  at  varying  concen-
 trations.
  Gravesend  Bay was dredged to supply soil for a number of construction
 projects. This process created borrow pits in the  bay.  These  borrow
 pits have been identified as an attractive alternative for the disposing
 of dredge material.
  §  2. Section 15-0505 of the environmental conservation law is amended
 by adding a new subdivision 3-b to read as follows:
  3-B. IN FILLING THE GRAVESEND BAY BORROW PITS THE DEPARTMENT MAY  ONLY
 GRANT  A  PERMIT  IF  THE PROPOSED SEDIMENTS AND FILL MATERIALS MEET THE
 FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
  (1) COMPLY WITH FEDERAL UNRESTRICTED OCEAN DUMPING CRITERIA;
  (2) HAVE BEEN TESTED AND TEST RESULTS INDICATE NO UNACCEPTABLE TOXICI-
 TY OR BIOACCUMULATION IN BIOLOGICAL TEST SYSTEMS;
  (3) HAS NO POTENTIAL SHORT-TERM, OR ACUTE, IMPACTS  OR  LONG-TERM,  OR
 CHRONIC, IMPACTS; AND
  (4)  REQUIRES  NO  SPECIAL  PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES ARE REQUIRED DURING
 DISPOSAL.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed June 30, 2028.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
