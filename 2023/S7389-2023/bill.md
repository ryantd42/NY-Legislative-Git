 SION REVENUE FOR THE SHOWING OF MOTION PICTURES AND THE SALE OF FOOD AND
 NON-ALCOHOLIC  BEVERAGES,  or  such  other lawful adult entertainment or
 recreational facility as the liquor authority, giving due regard to  the
 convenience  of  the public and the strict avoidance of sales prohibited
 by this chapter, shall by regulation classify for eligibility.  [Nothing
 contained  in this subdivision shall be deemed to authorize the issuance
 of a license to a motion picture theatre, except those meeting the defi-
 nition of restaurant and meals, and where all seating is at tables where
 meals are served.]
  § 3. Subdivision 8 of section 64-a of the alcoholic  beverage  control
 law,  as added by chapter 531 of the laws of 1964, is amended to read as
 follows:
  8. Every special on-premises licensee shall regularly keep food avail-
 able for sale to its customers for  consumption  on  the  premises.  The
 availability  of  sandwiches, soups or other foods, whether fresh, proc-
 essed, pre-cooked or  frozen,  shall  be  deemed  compliance  with  this
 requirement.  FOR MOTION PICTURE THEATRES LICENSED UNDER PARAGRAPH (B)
 OF SUBDIVISION SIX OF THIS SECTION, FOOD THAT IS TYPICALLY  FOUND  IN  A
 MOTION  PICTURE  THEATRE,  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: POPCORN, CANDY,

 MENT. The licensed premises shall comply at all times with all the regu-
 lations of the local department of health.  Nothing  contained  in  this
 subdivision,  however,  shall  be  construed to require that any food be
 sold or purchased with any liquor, nor shall  any  rule,  regulation  or
 standard  be  promulgated or enforced requiring that the sale of food be
 substantial or that the receipts of the business  other  than  from  the
 sale  of  liquor  equal  any set percentage of total receipts from sales
 made therein.

 law,  as added by chapter 531 of the laws of 1964, is amended to read as

 RESPECT  TO WHETHER THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE APPROVED, AND SUCH OPINION
 MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER GOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO  DENY  ANY
 SUCH APPLICATION.

 carry out the provisions of this section.
