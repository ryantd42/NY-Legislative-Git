 AN ACT to amend the social services law, in relation to increasing  from

  child living independently

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision 5 of section 409-a of the
 social services law, as amended by chapter 624 of the laws of  2019,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (c)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this section, where a
 social services official determines that a lack of adequate  housing  is
 the  primary factor preventing the discharge of a child or children from
 foster care including, but not limited to, children  with  the  goal  of
 discharge  to  independent living, preventive services shall include, in
 addition to any other payments  or  benefits  received  by  the  family,
 special  cash  grants  in  the  form  of  rent subsidies, including rent
 arrears, or any other assistance, sufficient to obtain adequate housing.
 Such rent subsidies or assistance shall not exceed the  sum  of  [three]
 SEVEN hundred TWENTY-FIVE dollars per month, shall not be provided for a
 period  of  more than three years, MAY BE PROVIDED UP TO AGE TWENTY-FOUR
 FOR YOUTH DISCHARGED FROM FOSTER CARE, and shall be considered a special
 grant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the ability
 of those using such rent subsidy to live with roommates. The  provisions
 of  this  paragraph  shall  not  be  construed  to limit such official's
 authority to provide other preventive services.
  § 2. Subdivision 7 of section 409-a of the  social  services  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  624  of  the  laws  of 2019, is amended to read as

  7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,  if  a  social
 services official determines that a lack of adequate housing is a factor
 that may cause the entry of a child or children into foster care and the
 family  has  at least one service need other than lack of adequate hous-
 ing,  preventive services may include, in addition to any other payments
 or benefits received by the family, special cash grants in the  form  of
 rent  subsidies, including rent arrears, or any other assistance, suffi-
 cient to obtain adequate housing.  Such  rent  subsidies  or  assistance
 shall  not  exceed  the sum of [three] SEVEN hundred TWENTY-FIVE dollars
 per month, shall not be provided for a period of more than three  years,
 MAY  BE  PROVIDED UP TO AGE TWENTY-FOUR FOR YOUTH DISCHARGED FROM FOSTER
 CARE, and shall be considered a special grant. Nothing in this  subdivi-
 sion  shall  be  construed to limit the ability of those using such rent
 subsidy to live with roommates. The provisions of this  paragraph  shall
 not  be  construed  to  limit such official's authority to provide other
 preventive services.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
