  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision 5 of section 409-a of the
 social services law, as amended by section 1 of part BB of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) (I) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,  where  a
 social  services  official determines that a lack of adequate housing is
 the primary factor preventing the discharge of a child or children  from
 foster  care  including,  but  not limited to, children with the goal of
 discharge to independent living, preventive services shall  include,  in
 addition  to  any  other  payments  or  benefits received by the family,
 special cash grants in  the  form  of  rent  subsidies,  including  rent
 arrears, or any other assistance, sufficient to obtain adequate housing.
 Such  rent  subsidies  or  assistance  shall not exceed the sum of seven
 hundred twenty-five dollars per month, shall not be provided for a peri-
 od of more than three years, MAY BE PROVIDED UP TO AGE  TWENTY-FOUR  FOR
 YOUTH  DISCHARGED  FROM  FOSTER  CARE, and shall be considered a special
 grant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the ability
 of those using such rent subsidy to live with roommates. The  provisions

 of  this  paragraph  shall  not  be  construed  to limit such official's
 authority to provide other preventive services.
  (II) PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT  FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING AFTER THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS  SUBPARAGRAPH,  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL SET THE
 MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR SUCH  RENT  SUBSIDIES  OR  ASSISTANCE  PURSUANT  TO

 BY THE UNITED  STATES BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.
  §  2.  Subdivision  7  of section 409-a of the social services law, as
 amended by section 2 of part BB of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2023,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  7.  (A)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this section, if a
 social services official determines that a lack of adequate housing is a
 factor that may cause the entry of a child or children into foster  care
 and the family has at least one service need other than lack of adequate
 housing,  preventive  services  may  include,  in  addition to any other
 payments or benefits received by the family, special cash grants in  the
 form of rent subsidies, including rent arrears, or any other assistance,
 sufficient to obtain adequate housing. Such rent subsidies or assistance
 shall not exceed the sum of seven hundred twenty-five dollars per month,
 shall  not  be  provided  for  a period of more than three years, MAY BE
 PROVIDED UP TO AGE TWENTY-FOUR FOR YOUTH DISCHARGED  FROM  FOSTER  CARE,
 and  shall  be  considered  a special grant. Nothing in this subdivision
 shall be construed to limit the ability of those using such rent subsidy
 to live with roommates. The provisions of this paragraph  shall  not  be
 construed to limit such official's authority to provide other preventive
 services.

 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PARAGRAPH, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL SET THE MAXIMUM
 AMOUNT FOR SUCH RENT SUBSIDIES  OR ASSISTANCE PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH  (A)
 OF THIS SUBDIVISION AT THE AMOUNT OF THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR INDEXED TO
 ANY  POSITIVE  GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AS SET BY THE UNITED
 STATES BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner  as section 1 of part BB of chapter 56 of the laws of 2023, takes
 effect.
