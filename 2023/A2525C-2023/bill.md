  Section  1.  Paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision 5 of section 409-a of the
 social services law, as amended by section 1 of part BB of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  section,  where  a
 social  services  official determines that a lack of adequate housing is
 the primary factor preventing the discharge of a child or children  from
 foster  care  including,  but  not limited to, children with the goal of
 discharge to independent living, preventive services shall  include,  in
 addition  to  any  other  payments  or  benefits received by the family,
 special cash grants in  the  form  of  rent  subsidies,  including  rent
 arrears, or any other assistance, sufficient to obtain adequate housing.
 Such  rent  subsidies  or  assistance  shall not exceed the sum of seven
 hundred twenty-five dollars per month, shall not be provided for a peri-

 of those using such rent subsidy to live with roommates. The  provisions
 of  this  paragraph  shall  not  be  construed  to limit such official's
 authority to provide other preventive services.
  §  2.  Subdivision  7  of section 409-a of the social services law, as
 amended by section 2 of part BB of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2023,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  7.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this section, if a social
 services official determines that a lack of adequate housing is a factor
 that may cause the entry of a child or children into foster care and the
 family has at least one service need other than lack of  adequate  hous-
 ing,  preventive services may include, in addition to any other payments
 or benefits received by the family, special cash grants in the  form  of
 rent  subsidies, including rent arrears, or any other assistance, suffi-
 cient to obtain adequate housing.  Such  rent  subsidies  or  assistance
 shall not exceed the sum of seven hundred twenty-five dollars per month,
 shall  not  be  provided  for  a period of more than three years, MAY BE
 PROVIDED UP TO AGE TWENTY-FOUR FOR YOUTH DISCHARGED  FROM  FOSTER  CARE,
 and  shall  be  considered  a special grant. Nothing in this subdivision
 shall be construed to limit the ability of those using such rent subsidy
 to live with roommates. The provisions of this paragraph  shall  not  be
 construed to limit such official's authority to provide other preventive
 services.
  §  3.  This  act  shall  take  effect on the same date and in the same
 manner as part BB of chapter 56 of the laws of 2023, takes effect.
