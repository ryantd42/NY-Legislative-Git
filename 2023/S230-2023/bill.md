 added by section 1 of part CC of chapter 56 of the  laws  of  2014,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  The  purpose of the universal full-day pre-kindergarten program is
 to incentivize and  fund  state-of-the-art  innovative  pre-kindergarten
 programs [and to encourage program creativity through competition].
  5.  The  department shall develop a scoring system, which it shall use
 to evaluate which applications shall be funded [on a competitive  basis]
 based  on  merit  and  factors including but not limited to the criteria
 listed above and student and community need. [Upon  review  of  applica-
 tions,  if the program is oversubscribed in any region or regions of the
 state, the department shall notify the division  of  the  budget,  which
 shall  develop  a  plan  for  distribution of available slots within any
 oversubscribed region.] The subscription for the New York city region is
 three hundred million dollars. THE SUBSCRIPTION FOR EACH REGION  OF  THE
 STATE  OTHER  THAN THE NEW YORK CITY REGION SHALL BE IN AN AMOUNT SUFFI-
 CIENT TO PROVIDE SLOTS FOR ALL QUALIFYING PROGRAMS. The department shall
 allocate full-day pre-kindergarten conversion  slots  and  new  full-day
