  6-c. a. Building aid for metal detectors, SECURITY AND SAFETY IMPROVE-
 MENTS, and safety devices for  electrically  operated  partitions,  room

 school district pursuant to subdivision six of this section, the commis-
 sioner is hereby authorized to apportion to any  school  district  addi-
 tional  building  aid  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  for its approved
 expenditures in the base year  for  the  purchase  of  stationary  metal
 detectors,  security  cameras,  SCHOOL SECURITY AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS,
 AND safety devices for electrically operated partitions and room  divid-
 ers required pursuant to section four hundred nine-f of this chapter, or
 other  security  devices  approved by the commissioner that increase the
 safety of students and school personnel, provided, however,  that  funds
 apportioned  to  school  districts  pursuant  to  this section shall not
 supplant funds  for  existing  district  expenditures  or  for  existing
 contractual  obligations of the district for stationary metal detectors,
 security cameras, SCHOOL SECURITY AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS, AND partition

 held  metal  detectors  shall  not  be eligible for aid pursuant to this

 other security devices shall be limited to electronic  security  systems
 and  hardened  doors,  and  provided  that  for projects approved by the
 commissioner on or after the first day of July two thousand thirteen and
 [before the first day of July two thousand twenty-three] THEREAFTER such
 additional aid shall equal the product of (i)  the  building  aid  ratio
 computed for use in the current year pursuant to paragraph c of subdivi-
