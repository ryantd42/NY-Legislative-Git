 further  accident  related  thereto and conflagration attendant upon its
 ignition. Such department's criteria shall be no less  restrictive  than
 existing federal regulations. Such department shall within one year from
 the  effective  date  of this section, adopt regulations prescribing the
 forms and procedures to be followed, which shall include notice  to  all
 affected municipal police and fire departments, for the certification of
 routes  to be used for the safe intrastate transportation of such lique-

 compliance  and certify with respect thereto, or by a combination of the
 foregoing means as it may by regulation provide.
  4. In the event of the failure of the holder of an environmental safe-
 ty permit issued under section 23-1707[, of  route  certification  under
 section  23-1713,] or of a non-conforming facility under section 23-1719
 to comply with the terms thereof or the  provisions  of  the  rules  and
 regulations adopted under article 70 of this chapter, the department may

  § 4. Subdivisions 4, 6 and 8 of section 23-1717 of  the  environmental
 conservation  law,  subdivisions  4 and 8 as added by chapter 892 of the
 laws of 1976, and subdivision 6 as amended by chapter 233 of the laws of
 1979, are amended to read as follows:
  4. The report of  the  department  shall  detail  the  capability  and
 preparedness,  or  lack  thereof, of such fire department or departments
 effectively to prevent or extinguish a fire at or related to any of  the
 reported  facilities[,  or  in  connection  with  the transportation] of
 liquefied natural or petroleum gas; proposals for further  training  and
 qualification of personnel which, if implemented, would enable such fire
 department  or  departments  effectively  to carry out such responsibil-
 ities; and a detailed analysis of the cost of training and qualification
 of such municipal fire department personnel to do  so,  including  those
 related to additional manpower, new or additional equipment, or training
 of  such  personnel,  although not limited thereto.  Such report, in its
 cost analysis and in making recommendations with respect thereto,  shall
 report  separately with regard to projected hiring of additional person-
 nel, the purchase of new  or  additional  equipment  and  supplies,  and

 section  and  the  allocation  of  the cost thereof, with respect to the
 particular permit or certificate or certificates granted, to the utility
 or other person subject to the requirements of this title.
  8.  The storage[, transportation,] and conversion of liquefied natural
 and petroleum gas within the state, in view of its  extreme  volatility,
 high  flammability,  and  dangerous qualities if mishandled resulting in
 accidental release, is determined to be  hazardous  and  entails  strict
 liability  on  the part of any person, as defined under this title, that
 undertakes such activities in the state.  Neither  compliance  with  the
 requirements  of  this title, nor the exercise of due care, shall excuse
 any such person from liability for personal or  property  damage  deter-
 mined  to  be  caused  by the accidental release of liquefied natural or
 petroleum gas within the state, and neither proof of means  of  ignition
 nor  distinctions  between direct and consequential damage shall relieve
 such person of absolute liability without regard to intent or negligence
 for any personal or property damage thereby caused.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
