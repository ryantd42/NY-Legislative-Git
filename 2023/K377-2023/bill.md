BY: M. of A. Seawright
 
  CALLING  for  ratification  of  the  Equal  Rights
  Amendment
 
  WHEREAS, The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly  guarantee  equal
rights to all persons regardless of sex; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  19th  Amendment, adopted in 1920, grants all citizens
the right to vote without abridgment or denial on account of sex; and
 
  WHEREAS, The ERA was written by suffragist  leader  Alice  Paul  and
introduced  in  Congress  in 1923, was passed by Congress in 1972 with a
seven-year time limit, and after Congressional  extension  of  the  time
limit  to  June  30,  1982,  has  been  ratified  by 35 of the 38 states
necessary to put it into the Constitution; and
 
  WHEREAS, Article V of the Constitution imposes  no  time  limit  for
ratification  of amendments; Supreme Court decisions have recognized the
power of Congress to determine the mode of ratification;  and  the  1992
ratification  of  the  27th ("Madison") Amendment 203 years after it was
first proposed supports the premise that state  ERA  ratification  votes
since 1972 are sufficiently contemporaneous; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On March 20, 2017, the State of Nevada voted to ratify the
Equal  Rights  Amendment,  leaving  only  two  more  states  needed  for
ratification; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On May 30, 2018, the State of Illinois voted to ratify the
Equal  Rights  Amendment,  leaving  only  one  more  state  needed  for
ratification; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On January 15, 2020, the State of Virginia voted to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 17, 2021, the U.S House of Representatives  passed
HJ  Res  17  to  remove  the  deadline for the ratification of the Equal
Rights Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS,On January 27,  2022,  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives
introduced  a  resolution recognizing the Equal Rights Amendment has met
all requirements to be affirmed as the 28th Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, The President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr.  has
urged  Congress to pass a resolution recognizing the ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, A leader in advocating for women's equality, New York State
has championed paid family leave, equal pay for equal work,  and  issues
that face pregnant women in the workforce; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
call on all members of the U.S. Senate and House of  Representatives  in
the  117th  Congress  to  co-sponsor,  support,  and pass into law joint
 
resolutions for both the  traditional  Article  V  ratification  process
(H.J. Res. 28); and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the President of the Senate of  the  United  States,  the
Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  and to each member of the
Congress of the United States from the State of New York.
