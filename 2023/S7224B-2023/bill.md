  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  36,819
  - Average Age:  48.3
  - Average Service:  11.6
  - Average Salary:  90,200
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS:  Currently,  NYCERS  Transit members are
 generally entitled to a lump sum  ordinary  death  benefit  equal  to  a
 multiple  of salary plus the return of member accumulated contributions,
 if any. These death benefits are generally calculated as three times the
 final year's salary  and  may  be  subject  to  salary  caps  and  other
 reductions.
  Under the proposed legislation, the ordinary death benefit for members
 who  are  eligible to receive a service retirement benefit and die prior
 to retirement would be the greater of their current death benefit or the
 value of the pension reserve that would have been established  had  they
 retired on the date of their death. The pension reserve is the actuarial
 present value of all pension payments expected to be made had the member
 retired  for service.  This type of lump sum pension reserve death bene-
 fit is sometimes referred to as a Death Gamble, and is  afforded,  in  a
 similar form, to Tier 1 NYCERS members.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for NYC Transit members.  New  entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and

  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-45 dated  April  19,
 2024  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
