  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 25, 2023, as El Dia Del Bodeguero in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
illustrious  businesses  which  positively  impact  and  substantially
contribute to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Sunday, June 25, 2023, as
El Dia Del Bodeguero in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, El  Dia  Del  Bodeguero  translates  to  "The  Day  of  the
Bodeguero"  in  English;  a  bodeguero  is an owner or worker of a small
owner-operated convenience store, known as a bodega; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bodegas are vital to urban environments,  offering  grocery
staples  and  hot food;  these stores are characteristic of communities
and are typically rooted in Puerto Rican and Cuban heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, The term "bodega" was derived from  the  Spanish  word  for
"storeroom" or "wine cellar," and has been adapted to modern language to
represent  convenient  grocery stores in cities all over the nation, but
most notably, in the northeast of the U.S.; and
 
  WHEREAS, In more recent years, bodega ownership has  spread  further
than  Cuban and Puerto Rican influence, with approximately 65 percent of
New York bodegas being owned by Dominicans, and 35 percent comprising of
a mix of other ethnic groups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  bodeguero's  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,
characterized by an impressive commitment and an uncompromising standard
of  excellence  on  behalf of the business and the community they serve;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges these exceptional businesses and their contributions to the
local  and  State  economies, fully confident that they will continue to
enjoy the sparkling successes  they  have  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 25, 2023, as  El  Dia
Del Bodeguero in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
