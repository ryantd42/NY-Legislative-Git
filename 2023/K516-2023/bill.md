  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Stop the Bleed Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Stop the Bleed Month in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
Stop the Bleed Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Stop the Bleed Campaign is a call to action; a
person  can  die  from  blood loss within five minutes, therefore, it is
important to stop the blood loss as quickly as possible; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trauma is the leading cause of death  for  Americans  under
the age of 46; the top cause of preventable death in trauma is bleeding;
20%  of people who have died from traumatic injuries could have survived
with quick bleeding control; 35% of pre-hospital deaths are due to blood
loss;and
 
  WHEREAS, 80% of victims in a mass casualty event are transported  to
the hospital by members of the public; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Stop the Bleed Campaign increases awareness of
the  American College of Surgeons Stop the Bleed program and its goal is
to  connect  Bleeding  Control  instructors  with  interested  citizens
throughout  the  month of May 2023, and specifically during the American
College of Emergency Physician's EMS Week, May 21-27, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2018, the National Stop the  Bleed  Day  saw  incredible
success  with  over  35,000  citizens in all 50 states and 10 countries,
including England, Italy, and Australia  trained  through  the  Bleeding
Control  Basic  (B-Con)  course; those trained included law enforcement,
emergency first responders, and citizen bystanders; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Stop the  Bleed  initiative  was  started  in  2015  to
increase  B-Con  training,  as  hemorrhage  is  the  leading  cause  of
preventable death in the pre-hospital environment; and
 
  WHEREAS, While the Hartford Consensus and Stop the Bleed  resolution
described  a  need for bystander B-Con training, National Stop the Bleed
Month campaign  seized  on  this  consensus  and  put  it  into  action,
providing  B-Con  familiarization and training to increase survivability
in these situations; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim May 2023, as Stop the
Bleed Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Stop the Bleed Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
