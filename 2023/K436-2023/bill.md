  WHEREAS,  Jordanian-Americans  continue  to  make  innumerable  and
immense contributions to the wealth and cultural heritage of  our  great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize

  WHEREAS, Jordan  is  a  Middle  Eastern  nation  which  is  a  major
strategic and economic partner of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jordan is a nation of rich global significance, home to the
abandoned  lost  city  of ancient Petra, one of the New Seven Wonders of
the Ancient World tucked deep within  a  winding  network  of  sandstone
canyons, which has been continuously inhabited since 7000 BCE and served
as  the  bustling  trade  center  and  capital  city  of the prehistoric
Nabataean empire, which dates back to 400 BCE; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jordanian-Americans have brought with them and  adhered  to
their  resilient  family  values,  strong  work  ethic,  dedication  to
education, and diversity in faith and creed that have added strength  to
our democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first identifiable wave of Jordanian immigrants arrived
in New York in the 1930s, where many individuals and families settled in
New  York  City  and  its  suburbs  to partake in the American Dream and
contribute to our great state; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York continues to be home to the largest population  of
Jordanian-Americans in the United States, where many Jordanian-Americans
have  made significant contributions to government, education, industry,
business, medicine, science, the arts, and our  nation's  armed  forces;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jordanian-Americans  continue  to  be  one  of the fastest
growing immigrant communities in our state; and
 
  WHEREAS, By recognizing the  accomplishments  and  contributions  of
Jordanian-Americans, this great Empire State reaffirms our commitment to
diversity  and  equal  opportunity  for  all,  thereby ensuring a bright
future for all New Yorkers and Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  25,  2023,  as
Jordanian-American Heritage Day in the State of New York in  conjunction
 
with  the  77th  Anniversary  of  the  Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan's
