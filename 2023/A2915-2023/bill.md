 GOVERNMENT, THE STATE AGENCY THAT IS CHARGED WITH REVIEWING THE PETITION

 GOVERNMENT  TO  PROPERLY  PREPARE AND SUBMIT SUCH PETITION. IN THE EVENT
 THAT SUCH STATE AGENCY REVIEWING THE PETITION OF  THE  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT
 PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FOUR-A  OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE
 PROCEDURE ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE REMEDY SOUGHT BY SUCH  LOCAL  GOVERN-
 MENT,  THE  COUNCIL MAY HEAR AND CONSIDER AN APPEAL OF SUCH DECISION AND
 GRANT SUCH RELIEF AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE, INCLUDING  THE  MAKING  OF  A
 REFERRAL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THE WAIVING, MODIFYING OR REPEALING OF SUCH
 REGULATORY  MANDATE.  THE  COUNCIL  SHALL ADOPT PROCEDURES BY WHICH IT
 SHALL CONSIDER, DECIDE AND  EFFECTUATE  THE  REMEDIES  OF  SUCH  APPEALS
 CONSISTENT WITH THIS SECTION.
  B.  UPON  A  TWO-THIRDS  VOTE,  REFER A REGULATION TO THE GOVERNOR FOR

 SUCH REGULATION IMPOSES UPON  ANY  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  A  MANDATE  IN  AN

 LATION  TO  EFFECTUATE  SUCH  REPEAL  OR  MODIFICATION OF THE REGULATION

 OF SEVEN MEMBERS, REFER A STATUTE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR REPEAL OR  MODIFI-

 INTRODUCTION IN BOTH HOUSES  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE,  TO  EFFECTUATE  SUCH
 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF THE STATUTE.
  5.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT REQUEST. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY, BY RESOLUTION OF
 ITS GOVERNING BODY, ASK THE COUNCIL TO REVIEW A SPECIFIC STATUTE,  REGU-
 LATION,  RULE  OR  ORDER  OF  STATE GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH
 STATUTE, REGULATION, RULE OR ORDER OF STATE GOVERNMENT  IS  AN  UNFUNDED
 MANDATE  OR  IS  OTHERWISE UNSOUND, UNDULY BURDENSOME OR COSTLY SO AS TO
 REQUIRE THAT IT BE ELIMINATED OR REFORMED. NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY  MAKE
 MORE  THAN  THREE SUCH REQUESTS IN EACH CALENDAR YEAR. UPON SUCH REVIEW,
 THE COUNCIL SHALL, BY MAJORITY VOTE, DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH MANDATE  HAS
 BEEN IMPOSED UPON SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN AN UNSOUND, UNDULY BURDENSOME
 OR  COSTLY  MANNER,  SO  AS  TO  NECESSITATE  THAT  IT  BE ELIMINATED OR
 REFORMED.  A DETERMINATION OF THE COUNCIL  SHALL  RESOLVE  ANY  DISPUTE
 REGARDING  WHETHER SUCH A STATUTE, REGULATION, RULE OR ORDER CONSTITUTES
 SUCH AN UNFUNDED MANDATE, BUT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED  A  JUDICIAL  DETERMI-
 NATION UNDER THE LAW.
  6. APPEALS. UPON AN APPEAL OF A PETITION PREVIOUSLY DECIDED BY A STATE
 AGENCY  PURSUANT  TO SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR-A OF THE STATE ADMINISTRA-
 TIVE PROCEDURE ACT, THE COUNCIL, UPON REQUEST OF THE  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT,
 SHALL  REVIEW THE STATE AGENCY'S DETERMINATION AND MAY AFFIRM, MODIFY OR
 REJECT SUCH DETERMINATION.  SUCH APPEAL SHALL NOT PRECLUDE  OR  LIMIT  A
 LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  OR  ANY  OTHER  PARTY WITH STANDING FROM PURSUING ANY
 RIGHT IT MAY HAVE PURSUANT TO A PROCEEDING INSTITUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE SEVENTY-EIGHT OF THE CIVIL  PRACTICE  LAW  AND
 RULES OR ANY OTHER STATUTE.
