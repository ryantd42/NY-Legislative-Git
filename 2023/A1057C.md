 ral service provider in writing of his or her intent to do so.

  IN  CASE  OF  AN  ONLINE  DATING  SERVICE, THE CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE
 STATEMENT REQUIRED BY THIS SUBDIVISION,  MAY  BE  FURNISHED  AND  SIGNED
 ELECTRONICALLY,  PROVIDED  SUCH  CONTRACT  IS PROVIDED TO THE BUYER IN A
 CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS MANNER.
  (e) In every social referral service sale or renewal, the seller shall
 provide each purchaser with a clear and  conspicuous,  separate  written
 notice,  WHICH  MAY BE A CONSPICUOUS AND APPROPRIATELY LABELED HYPERLINK
 FOR AN ONLINE DATING SERVICE, to be known as the "Dating Service Consum-
 er Bill of Rights", which shall contain at least the following  informa-
 tion:
  Dating Service Consumer Bill of Rights
  1.  No  social  referral service contract shall require the payment by
 you, the purchaser, of an amount greater than one thousand  dollars.  In
 addition, no such contract may extend over a period of time greater than
 two years.
  2. No social referral service contract shall require you, the purchas-
 er,  to  purchase  a  good  or  service  which is directly or indirectly
 related to the social referral service.  These extra services are  known
 as  ancillary services and, while these ancillary service may be offered
 to you, the law prohibits the seller from requiring  that  you  purchase
 this service as a condition of your social referral service contract.
  3.  If  your  social referral service contract costs more than twenty-
 five dollars, the seller must furnish a minimum number of referrals  per
 month  to  you.  If  this minimum amount is not furnished to you for two
 successive months, you have the option of cancelling  the  contract  and
 receiving  a  full refund of all the money you paid, less a cancellation
 fee which cannot exceed either fifteen percent of the cash  price  or  a
 pro rata amount for the number of referrals furnished to you.
  4.  Your  social  referral  service contract must specify the distance
 which you, the purchaser, are willing  to  travel  to  meet  any  social
 referral.  No  social  referrals  shall  be  furnished where you and the
 referral live at a distance greater than the distance specified  in  the
 contract.
  5.  The  provider must have an established policy to address the situ-
 ation of your moving outside the area it services. This policy  must  be
 explained in your contract.
  6.  If  any  provision  of  the  social  referral  service contract is
 violated, you have the right to bring a court action against the provid-
 er which has violated the contract.
  8. Every contract  for  social  referral  service  shall  specify  the
 distance  which the buyer is willing to travel to meet any social refer-
 ral. No social referral shall be furnished by the seller to the buyer if
 either the buyer or the social referral reside  at  a  distance  further
 than  the  distance specified in either the buyer's or social referral's
 contracts.  THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ONLINE  DATING  SERVICES
 THAT ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO USERS ON A REGIONAL, NATIONAL, OR GLOBAL
 BASIS.
  8-a.  Every social referral service provider must establish and admin-
 ister a fair and reasonable policy for the situation in which a purchas-
 er moves to permanently reside at a location outside the service area of
 A. 1057--C  5
 
 such provider.  This policy must be set  forth  in  every  contract  for
 social referral service.
  9. (a) Whenever there shall be a violation of this section an applica-
 tion  may  be  made by the attorney general in the name of the people of
 the state of New York to a court or justice  having  jurisdiction  by  a
 special  proceeding  to  issue  an  injunction,  and  upon notice to the
 defendant of not less than five days, to enjoin and restrain the contin-
 uance of such violation; and if it shall appear to the  satisfaction  of
 the  court  or  justice  that  the defendant has, in fact, violated this
 section, an injunction may be issued by the court or justice,  enjoining
 and restraining any further violations, without requiring proof that any
 person  has,  in  fact,  been  injured  or  damaged thereby. In any such
 proceeding, the court may make allowances to  the  attorney  general  as
 provided  in  paragraph  six  of subdivision (a) of section eighty-three
 hundred three of the civil practice law and rules, and  direct  restitu-
 tion.  Whenever  the  court  shall  determine  that  a violation of this
 section has occurred, the court may impose a civil penalty of  not  more
 than  one  thousand  dollars for each violation.  In connection with any
 such proposed application the attorney general  is  authorized  to  take
 proof  and  make  a  determination  of  the  relevant facts and to issue
 subpoenas in accordance with the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  and
 direct restitution.
  (b)  Any  person who has been injured by reason of a violation of this
 section may bring an action in his  or  her  own  name  to  enjoin  such
 violation,  an  action  to  recover  his  or her actual damages or fifty
 dollars whichever is greater, or both such actions.
  (c) In cities having a population over one million, the provisions  of
 this  section  may be enforced concurrently with the attorney general by
 the director of a local or municipal consumer affairs office. In  cities
 having  a  population  over  one  million,  such local entities may also
 require social referral services to be licensed. Such licensing require-
 ments may be promulgated  as  are  reasonably  necessary  to  effectuate
 licensure,  provided,  however,  that  such  localities  may  not impose
 substantive requirements that are inconsistent with or more  restrictive
 than  those  set forth in this section. Any fee for such license may not
 exceed three hundred forty dollars for a two year period.
  10. (A) AN ONLINE DATING SERVICE SHALL DISCLOSE TO ALL OF ITS NEW YORK
 MEMBERS KNOWN TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED AND RESPONDED  TO  AN  ON-SITE
 MESSAGE FROM A BANNED MEMBER:
  (1)  THE USER NAME, IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, OR OTHER PROFILE IDENTIFIER
 OF THE BANNED MEMBER;
  (2) THE FACT THAT THE BANNED MEMBER WAS BANNED BECAUSE, IN  THE  JUDG-
 MENT  OF  THE  ONLINE  DATING SERVICE, THE BANNED MEMBER MAY HAVE BEEN
 USING A FALSE IDENTITY OR MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF  ATTEMPTING  TO
 OBTAIN MONEY FROM OTHER MEMBERS THROUGH FRAUDULENT MEANS;
  (3) THAT A MEMBER SHOULD NEVER SEND MONEY OR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFOR-
 MATION TO ANOTHER MEMBER; AND
  (4)  A  HYPERLINK TO ONLINE INFORMATION THAT CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY
 ADDRESSES THE SUBJECT OF HOW TO AVOID BEING DEFRAUDED BY ANOTHER  MEMBER
 OF AN ONLINE DATING SERVICE.
  (B)  THE  NOTIFICATION  REQUIRED  BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL BE:
  (1) CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS;
  (2) BY E-MAIL, TEXT MESSAGE, OR OTHER APPROPRIATE  MEANS  OF  COMMUNI-
 CATION; AND
 A. 1057--C  6
 
  (3)  SENT  WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER THE FRAUD BAN, OR AT A LATER
 TIME IF THE SERVICE HAS DETERMINED, BASED ON AN  ANALYSIS  OF  EFFECTIVE
 MESSAGING,  THAT  A  DIFFERENT  TIME  IS MORE EFFECTIVE, BUT IN NO EVENT
 LATER THAN THREE DAYS AFTER THE FRAUD BAN.
  (C) AN ONLINE DATING SERVICE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY MEMBER WHO HAS
 AN ACCOUNT OR PROFILE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A FRAUD BAN, FOR DISCLOSING
 TO  ANY  MEMBER  THAT IT HAS BANNED THE MEMBER, THE USER NAME OR ACCOUNT
 IDENTIFIER OF THE BANNED MEMBER, OR THE REASONS FOR  THE  ONLINE  DATING
 SERVICE'S  DECISION  TO BAN SUCH MEMBER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION WHERE SUCH DISCLOSURE DOES NOT CONTAIN THEIR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING
 INFORMATION.
  (D) THIS SECTION DOES NOT DIMINISH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROTECTIONS
 FOR ONLINE DATING SERVICES THAT ARE AFFORDED  IN  47  USC  230,  OR  ANY
 RIGHTS OR PROTECTIONS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER IN LAW.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
