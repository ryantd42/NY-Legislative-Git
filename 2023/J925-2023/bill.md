  COMMEMORATING the 225th Anniversary of the Augusta
  Presbyterian Church of Oriskany Falls, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social, and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the tradition of this State and this  Nation  to  pay
tribute  to  those  institutions and individuals who have contributed to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 225th Anniversary of the Augusta Presbyterian Church  of
Oriskany Falls, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  history  of  the  church  began when a Congregational
society was formed in Augusta's log school on September  7,  1797,  with
nine charter members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A log school house stood on the west side of the road that
runs north from what is now known as Newells' Corners; it  was  in  that
schoolhouse  that  the  Congregational  Church  was  formed by Reverends
Asabell North of Clinton and Joel Bradley of Westmoreland; and
 
  WHEREAS, During Augusta  Presbyterian  Church's  humble  beginnings,
services were held in private homes, schoolhouses, barns, and outside in
the  open  air;  from 1805 until 1816, the congregation worshiped in the
Town Hall; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  present  building,  located  in  Oriskany  Falls,  was
completed  in  1816,  and the Augusta Presbyterian Church was officially
dedicated on February 3, 1817; and
 
  WHEREAS, Four churches were formed out of the  Augusta  Presbyterian
Church,  including  the  Oriskany  Falls  and  Deansboro  Congregational
Churches, and the Knoxboro Presbyterian Church; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, Augusta Presbyterian Church has  grown
to include an active Sunday School and Vacation Bible School; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today, Augusta Presbyterian Church stands on the threshold
of tomorrow, prepared to meet the  challenges  of  the  coming  decades,
while  retaining  that  spiritual resolve which has so characterized its
glorious past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  225th  Anniversary  of  Augusta Presbyterian Church of
Oriskany Falls, New York, confident that this commemoration reflects the
 
belief in those values which enhance the dignity and  purpose  of  life;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Augusta Presbyterian Church of Oriskany Falls, New York.
