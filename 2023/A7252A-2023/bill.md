 ty law is amended by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows:
  (E)  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (C) AND SUBPARAGRAPH

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would change the allowable overtime compensation included in
 the final average salary calculation beginning January 1, 2024 to thirty
 percent  of a member's annual wages if greater than the limits currently
 defined in section 601 of the Retirement and  Social  Security  Law  for
 local  county correction officers. Current limits were set at $15,000 at
 the inception of each tier, with the Tier 5 limit increasing 3% annually
 and the Tier 6 limit increasing annually with inflation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase in the annual contributions of  the
 counties  employing these correction officers of 0.4% of salary for Tier
 5 and 0.9% of salary for Tier 6 for the fiscal  year  ending  March  31,
 2024.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately 5.00% of the affected
 correction officers' compensation which will be borne  by  the  counties
 employing these correction officers as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  The  exact  number  of members who would be affected by this cannot be
 readily determined.
