 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to permit-
  ting a plaintiff to recover against a third party defendant in certain
  cases
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The civil practice law and rules is amended by adding a new
 section 1405 to read as follows:
  § 1405. PERMITTING PLAINTIFF, AS JUDGMENT CREDITOR AGAINST  DEFENDANT,
 TO  RECOVER  AND  COLLECT  UNSATISFIED  JUDGMENT  OR PORTION OF JUDGMENT
 AGAINST THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT LIABLE FOR CONTRIBUTION OR
 INDEMNIFICATION. (A) WHERE A PLAINTIFF HAS ENTERED A JUDGMENT AGAINST  A
 DEFENDANT  AND THE JUDGMENT REMAINS UNSATISFIED THIRTY DAYS AFTER IT HAS
 BEEN SERVED ON THE DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT DEBTOR,  AND  WHERE  JUDGMENT  HAS
 BEEN  ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT DEBTOR AGAINST A CO-DE-
 FENDANT OR THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT ON A CAUSE OF ACTION  FOR  CONTRIBUTION
 OR FOR CONTRACTUAL OR COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION, THE PLAINTIFF-JUDGMENT
 CREDITOR  MAY COLLECT ANY UNSATISFIED AMOUNT OF THE PLAINTIFF'S JUDGMENT
 AGAINST THE DEFENDANT FROM THE CO-DEFENDANT OR THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT  UP
 TO  THE AMOUNT AWARDED ON THE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR CONTRIBUTION OR INDEM-
 NIFICATION.
  (B) WHERE THE PLAINTIFF'S JUDGMENT  REMAINS  UNSATISFIED  THIRTY  DAYS
 AFTER IT HAS BEEN SERVED ON THE DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT DEBTOR, AND WHERE THE
 DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT  DEBTOR HAS A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR CONTRIBUTION OR FOR
 CONTRACTUAL OR COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION WHICH HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED  TO
 JUDGMENT, THE PLAINTIFF-JUDGMENT CREDITOR MAY ATTACH, OR TAKE AN ASSIGN-
 MENT  FROM  THE  DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT  DEBTOR  OF, THE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR
 CONTRIBUTION OR INDEMNIFICATION, AND PROSECUTE THE CAUSE  OF  ACTION  IN
 THE  PLAINTIFF'S  OWN  NAME  OR  IN  THE  NAME OF THE DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT
 DEBTOR, AND RECOVER A JUDGMENT THEREIN FOR THE SAME AMOUNT  OF  CONTRIB-

 UTION  OR  INDEMNIFICATION AS WOULD BE AWARDED TO THE DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT
 DEBTOR  IF  THE  DEFENDANT-JUDGMENT  DEBTOR  HAD  SATISFIED  PLAINTIFF'S
 ORIGINAL JUDGMENT IN FULL. SUCH REMEDY IS IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER MEANS
 AVAILABLE  TO THE PLAINTIFF-JUDGMENT DEBTOR FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE JUDG-
 MENT. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT AUTHORIZE DIRECT RECOVERY AGAINST A  THIRD-
 PARTY  DEFENDANT  IN  THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY CLAIM
 AGAINST THAT  THIRD-PARTY  DEFENDANT  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  BARRED  BY  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF SECTION ELEVEN OF THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION LAW, AND DOES
 NOT OTHERWISE PERMIT A PLAINTIFF TO BRING A CAUSE OF  ACTION  AGAINST  A
 THIRD  PARTY IF SUCH THIRD PARTY WAS THE PLANTIFF'S EMPLOYER AT THE TIME
 OF THE INCIDENT OR INJURY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately, and shall  apply  to  all
 judgments entered by plaintiffs on or after such date.
