 the  application  for  disability  retirement benefits of Andrew Reilly,
 Jr., who was employed as a clerk for the town  of  Hempstead  Sanitation
 District  1  and  a  member  of  the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system from March 1995 until October  15,  2020,  suffered  a
 stroke  on  February 20, 2020 and who, for reasons not ascribable to his
 own negligence, did not apply to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system for disability  retirement  benefits  because  of  the
 COVID-19,  novel coronavirus state of emergency, shall be deemed to have
 applied to the New York state and local employees' retirement system for
 disability retirement benefits within  30  days  of  his  disability  on
 February 20, 2020.
  § 2. All costs associated with the implementation of this act shall be
 borne  by  the  employers of the members of the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would deem Andrew Reilly Jr. to have applied to the New York
 State and Local Employees' Retirement System  (NYSLERS)  for  disability
 benefits within thirty days of their disability on February 20, 2020.

 S. 6857--A  2
 
  If  this  bill  is  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, and
 Andrew Reilly Jr.  is  subsequently  approved  for  disability  benefits
 pursuant to section 605 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, there
 will  be  an immediate past service cost of approximately $331,000 which
 will  be  borne  by  the  State  of New York and all local participating
 employers in the NYSLERS. This estimate assumes  that  payment  will  be
 made on February 1, 2025.
