 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to eliminating the cap  on  the
  maximum amount and the gross income requirement for the long-term care
  insurance credit
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subsection (aa) of section 606  of  the  tax
 law,  as  amended  by  section  1 of part E of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  (1) Residents. There shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
 by this article in an amount equal to twenty  percent  of  the  premiums
 paid  during  the taxable year for long-term care insurance. [The credit
 amount shall not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars and  shall  be
 allowed only if the amount of New York adjusted gross income required to
 be  reported  on  the  return  is  less  than two hundred fifty thousand
 dollars.] In order to qualify for such credit,  the  taxpayer's  premium
 payment  must  be for the purchase of or for continuing coverage under a
 long-term care insurance policy that qualifies for such credit  pursuant
 to  section  one thousand one hundred seventeen of the insurance law. If
 the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection for any taxable
 year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the  excess  may  be
 carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted from the
 taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to taxable
 years beginning on and after January 1, 2023.
