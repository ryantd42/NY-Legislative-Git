 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law and the  public  authorities
  law, in relation to authorizing a residential parking permit system in
  the  city of New York; and providing for the repeal of such provisions
  upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 a  lack of parking for residents of the city of New York has resulted in
 traffic hazards, congestion and air and noise  pollution.  In  addition,
 such  lack  of parking poses a hazard to residents and other pedestrians
 in such areas.
  The legislature further finds that a residential parking  system  will
 reduce such hazards and will reduce pollution levels as well. The legis-
 lature,  therefore,  declares the necessity of this act to authorize the
 city of New York to adopt a residential  parking  system  in  accordance
 with the provisions of this act.
  §  2.  The  vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new section
 1640-s to read as follows:
