 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to requiring the New York
  state teachers' retirement system to divest the retirement  system  of
  any  investments in corporations or companies included on an exclusion
  list of coal producers and oil and gas producers
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "teachers'
 fossil fuel divestment act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. 1. a. Climate change is a real and  serious
 threat  to  the  health, welfare, and prosperity of all New Yorkers, now
 and in the future. Maintaining the status  quo  of  fossil  fuel  energy
 production will lead to catastrophic results.
  b.  In  July  2019,  New  York state passed the climate leadership and
 community protection act and committed to reducing statewide  greenhouse
 gas  emissions  by eighty-five percent by 2050 and net zero emissions in
 all sectors of the economy. Other  cities  and  states  have  chosen  to
 pursue similar paths to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
  c.  The threat of climate change, and the transformation of the global
 energy system that will be necessary to mitigate it, will have a serious
 negative impact on investors whose assets are not aligned with the  goal
 of  keeping  the  global  average temperature increase below 1.5 degrees

 Celsius, as determined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel  on
 Climate Change.
  d.  There  are  no existing legal or fiduciary duties that require New
 York state's pension funds to invest in energy sources that are  harmful
 to  the  environment,  or  in  contradiction to the goals of the climate
 leadership and community protection act. Rather, there  are  alternative
 investments  that are available to our pension funds that do not present
 such harms.
  e. Many cities and states  have  recognized  the  harmful  effects  of
 pension  and investment funds investing in fossil fuels and have commit-
 ted to divesting those funds. Over 1,100 institutional investors repres-
 enting more than $11 trillion in holdings have chosen to pursue full  or
 partial  divestment  from  fossil fuel producers, including the New York
 city employees retirement system, the endowment and pension funds of the
 University of California system,  and  the  sovereign  wealth  funds  of
 Norway and Ireland.
  2. a. Continued investment in fossil fuel producers poses unacceptable
 risks  to  the people of the state of New York, as well as the long-term
 sustainability of the New York state teachers' retirement system.
  b. Investment in dangerous and harmful fossil fuels is not mandated by
 law. The New York state common  retirement  fund,  consistent  with  its
 fiduciary  duties,  has committed to complete reviews of all fossil fuel
 investments by 2025 and to divest from companies that fail to meet mini-
 mum standards. It has also set a precedent by choosing  to  divest  from
 certain  industries  in  the past due to the moral implications of their
 business models, including private prisons, firearms manufacturers,  and
 companies  doing business with Sudan, all while complying with the comp-
 troller's fiduciary obligations.
  c. New York owes duties to its  residents,  and  the  New  York  state
 teachers'  retirement  system owes duties to future beneficiaries. These
 duties can and should reasonably include considerations of human  inter-
 ests,  quality  of  life,  public  safety  and  security, and ultimately
 require a shift away from fossil  fuels  to  help  mitigate  the  future
 adverse effects of climate change.
  d.  According  to the U.S. Department of Labor's interpretive bulletin
 2015-1, environmental issues "may have  a  direct  relationship  to  the
 economic  value  of the plan's investment, and are not merely collateral
 considerations or tie-breakers, but rather are proper components of  the
 fiduciary's primary analysis of the economic merits of competing invest-
 ment choices."
  e.  Attempting  to profit from investments in companies whose business
 models, public relations campaigns, and lobbying efforts not  only  fail
 to  comply  with  New  York's  statutory climate goals, but also put the
 stability of our society and the safety of  our  citizens  at  risk,  is
 neither  morally  acceptable  nor  in  compliance with the legislature's
 responsibility to protect the financial security of current  and  future
 pension beneficiaries.
  f.  Currently, the majority of fossil fuel producers are not adjusting
 their business models to take into account the changing  energy  market,
 investing  billions of dollars in exploring and extracting new reserves,
 creating stranded asset risk and the potential  for  rapid,  unexpected,
 and significant loss of value.
  g.  Attempting  to  beat the market by holding these investments until
 the last possible moment is a high-risk strategy that  could  result  in
 the  loss  of  investment principal. In the words of the decarbonization
 advisory panel for the New York state common retirement fund, "being too
 A. 1101  3
 
 early in the avoidance of the risk of permanent loss is much less  of  a
 danger than being too late."
  h.  In  addition to the risks regarding retirement security, continued
 investment in the fossil fuel industry is counterproductive to the goals
 set forth in the climate leadership and community protection act.
  § 3. The education law is amended by adding a  new  section  508-b  to
 read as follows:
