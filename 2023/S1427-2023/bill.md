  e. To conduct any investigation authorized  by  this  section  at  any
 place within the state; and to maintain offices, hold meetings and func-
 tion at any place within the state as it may deem necessary;
  f. To conduct private and public hearings and to designate one or more
 members of the commission or of its staff to preside over any such hear-
 ings; and
  g.  To  administer  oaths  or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel
 their attendance, examine them under oath or affirmation and require the
 production of any books, records, documents or  other  evidence  it  may
 deem relevant or material to an investigation.
  §  2.  The  commission  shall  consist  of ten members, to be known as
 commissioners to be appointed as follows: Two members of the  commission
 shall  be  appointed  by the governor, two by the temporary president of
 the senate, two by the minority leader of the senate, two by the speaker
 of the assembly and two by the minority leader of the assembly, each  to
 serve  a  three year term. No more than five members shall belong to the
 same political party. No member or employee of the commission shall hold
 any other public office or public employment  and  no  member  shall  be
 employed  as a lobbyist. The governor shall designate the chairperson of
 the commission from among the members thereof, who shall serve as chair-
 person at the pleasure of the  governor.  The  chairperson  or  any  six
 members  of  the commission may call a meeting. Any vacancy occurring on
 the commission shall be filled within 60 days of its occurrence  in  the
 same  manner  as  the  original appointment. A vacancy in the commission

 appointed for the unexpired term of the member he or she  succeeds.  Six
 members  of  the commission shall constitute a quorum and the commission
 shall have power to act by majority vote of the total number of  members
 of  the  commission  without  vacancy.  Members of the commission may be
 removed by the governor for substantial neglect of duty,  gross  miscon-
 duct in office, inability to discharge the powers or duties of office or

 reply.
