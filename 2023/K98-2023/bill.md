  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Confer
  Plastics Inc.  in  North  Tonawanda,  New  York,  on
  January 22, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements of those individuals  and  businesses  which  substantially
contribute  to the economic vitality of their communities and the entire
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th  Anniversary  of  Confer  Plastics  Inc.  in  North
Tonawanda, New York, on Sunday, January 22, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion will be celebrated with a myriad
of events held throughout the year including a communitywide Open  House
on September 20, 2023; Confer Plastics will also bring back a variety of
previously  made  products,  including a bistro table and chair set that
had been popular locally, a flexible  funnel  that  Doug  Confer,  Bob's
father  and  the  current CEO, invented in the 1970s for putting gas and
oil into vehicles, and blue sleds originally made for the Louis Marx Toy
Company in the 1970s; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, a 60-page book about the company will also  be
distributed  for  free  from the Witmer Road facility, focusing on their
history, the different innovations they have been a  part  of,  and  the
power of the American dream; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Confer  Plastics was established by Ray Confer, who worked
in Norton Laboratories in Lockport, New York, after World War II  as  it
was  dabbling  in  plastic  products, such as the first plastic cameras,
handles for pots and pans, and kitchenware; he and  Peter  Sherman  then
decided  to start their own company using the blow mold method, Air Mold
Plastics; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ray Confer and his partner invented the living hinge, which
is the plastic hinge that goes between  the  two  halves  of  a  plastic
toolbox  or  tackle box; after that company closed in the mid-1960s, Ray
started another company, Airlock Plastics, followed by  Confer  Plastics
in 1973; and
 
  WHEREAS, From 1973-1986, Confer Plastics had rented space out of the
former  Roblin  Steel  plant  in  North  Tonawanda  before moving to its
current site at 97 Witmer Road;  in  2005,  the  Confers  purchased  its
distribution facility along Liberty Drive in Wheatfield, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sold  throughout  the  United  States  and  Canada, Confer
Plastics' plastic products range from kayaks, docks, sleds,  birdhouses,
skating rinks, pool steps, mannequins and a wide array of other products
focused on outdoor leisure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1993,  Confer  Plastics  started  using  large molding
machines which are atypical for the industry; these  machines  can  drop
 
100  or  150  pounds of plastic and make parts that can be as long as 15
feet; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  plastic  used  to  make these products is made out of
natural gas and comes  from  manufacturers  in  Pittsburgh,  Texas,  and
Louisiana;  in  an  average  24-hour  period, the facilities can produce
around 330 swimming pool ladders and 300 to 350 kayaks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, Confer Plastics has been  proudly  run
by  the Confer family; today, under the luminous leadership of President
Bob Confer and CEO Doug Confer, this community-minded  business  employs
180  people  working  across three shifts, 41 of whom have been with the
company for 20 years or more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  true  to  its  mission,  Confer  Plastics  will
continue to focus on its core competencies of the pool, spa, and outdoor
leisure industries, and do custom work for anyone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th  Anniversary  of  Confer  Plastics  Inc.  in  North
Tonawanda, New York, on January 22, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Bob Confer,  President,  and  Doug  Confer,  CEO,  Confer
Plastics Inc.
