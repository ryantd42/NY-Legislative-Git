 Introduced  by M. of A. ROZIC -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, the public service law,  the
  labor law, the civil service law and the executive law, in relation to
  establishing a nuclear whistleblower access and assistance program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The legislature finds that safe operation of  the  publicly
 and privately owned nuclear-powered electric generating facilities with-
 in  the  state  is a matter of paramount public concern. The legislature
 further finds that an essential component of any safety  strategy  is  a
 program  which  assures  that employees who have first-hand knowledge of
 potential safety problems can freely communicate their concerns  without
 fear  of  retaliation.  Although laws and regulations exist at both the
 state and federal level to protect whistleblowers, the legislature finds
 that the purpose served by such laws will be furthered if an affirmative
 program exists which encourages employees to come forward  with  safety-
 related  concerns. The legislature finds that the state, as the owner of
 the power plants operated by the power authority of  the  state  of  New
 York,  has an interest and obligation to ensure that such facilities are
 being managed in a way that provides the highest possible level of safe-
 ty.  The legislature also finds that  the  state  has  an  interest  in
 protecting  and  an obligation to protect its citizens from the possible
 hazards of privately owned nuclear-powered electric  generating  facili-
 ties.
  §  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 1873-a to read as follows:
  § 1873-A. NUCLEAR WHISTLEBLOWER ACCESS AND  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM.  1.
 "EMPLOYEES  AT  A  NUCLEAR-POWERED  ELECTRIC  GENERATING FACILITY" MEANS
