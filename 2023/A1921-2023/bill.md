 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  BICHOTTE HERMELYN, COLTON, WILLIAMS, THIELE,
  MEEKS, ZINERMAN, JACKSON, SIMON --  read  once  and  referred  to  the
  Committee on Health
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the public health law, in relation to establishing the
  "safe staffing for hospital care act"

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "safe staffing for hospital care act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares that the state has a  substantial  interest  in  assuring  that
 delivery  of  healthcare  services  to patients in healthcare facilities
 located within this state is  adequate  and  safe  and  that  healthcare
 facilities  retain  sufficient  nursing  staff  so as to promote optimal
 healthcare outcomes. Recent changes in our  healthcare  delivery  system
 are  resulting  in  a  higher  acuity level among patients in healthcare
 facilities. Inadequate hospital staffing results  in  dangerous  medical
 errors  and  patient  infections.  Inadequate and poorly monitored nurse
 staffing practices can adversely impact the health of patients who enter
 hospitals and outpatient emergency and surgical centers.  A  substantial
 number  of nurses indicate that hospital-patient acuity measurements are
 inadequate and that many hospitals rarely, if ever, staff  according  to
 an  acuity  measurement  tool. Hospital nurses work substantial overtime
 hours and nurses working twelve-hour shifts  work  the  most  additional
 overtime  hours  per week. Mandatory overtime and lengthy work hours for
 direct-care nurses constitute a threat  to  the  health  and  safety  of
 patients,  adversely  impact the general well-being of nurses and result
 in greater turnover,  which  increases  long-term  shortage  of  nursing
 personnel.  Establishing  staffing standards will ensure that healthcare
 facilities throughout the state operate in a manner that guarantees  the
 public  safety  and  the  delivery  of  quality healthcare services. The
