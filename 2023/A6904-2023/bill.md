 AN ACT to amend the public officers law,  in  relation  to  defense  and
  indemnity of certain officers and employees; and to create a state-re-
  gulated  program for expanding abortion services in New York state for
  the benefit of out-of-state patients
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York Santoro provider protection act of 2023".
  § 2. Legislative intent.  (a)  Because  access  to  reproductive  and
 abortion  care  and  personal  autonomy  over reproductive decisions are
 fundamental human rights, it is the intent of the New  York  legislature
 to create a state-funded and regulated program to allow providers within
 New  York state to provide abortions and telehealth services to patients
 who reside outside of New York.
  (b) Because cross-border medical services implicate and involve inter-
 state commerce, as U.S. citizens often  travel  between  the  states  to
 obtain  such  services,  it is the intent of the New York legislature to
 protect interstate travel and commerce,  such  as  telehealth,  for  the
 provision of abortion services in this state.
  (c)  Because strict limitations or bans on abortions infringe upon the
 free exercise of religion, and other constitutional rights,  it  is  the
 intent  of  the  New  York  legislature  to protect those constitutional
 rights.
  (d) Because every year approximately 20 million women  worldwide  risk
 their  lives to undergo unsafe abortions, and understanding that persons
 who reside in states that have restricted or intend to  restrict  access
 to  necessary  abortions  are  more likely, as Geraldine Santoro did, to
 seek unsafe methods or procedures to terminate pregnancies from unquali-
 fied individuals, including themselves, it is the intent of the New York

 legislature to prevent further physical harm to such persons  from  both
 unsafe procedures and from dangerous complications related to pregnancy.
  (e)  Because  strict  limitations  or bans on abortions will adversely
 affect the rights of Americans in the exercise of personal control  over
 their  bodies  and  health care decisions, and because these limitations
 and bans will have a disproportionate impact  on  indigent  persons  and
 persons  of  color,  it  is  the  intent  of the New York legislature to
 protect even persons outside the state of New York, in coordination with
 other like-minded states.
  (f) A specific legislative intent for this act is to protect  commerce
 within New York, and between New York and other states, including by (1)
 protecting  consumers  of  abortion-related  services in New York or, if
 appropriate, helping consumers find and obtain abortion-related services
 in other states, (2) using common carriers, hotel chains, and  transport
 companies  to facilitate consumer choice, (3) providing financial incen-
 tives for  new  providers  to  enter  the  market  for  abortion-related
 services,  (4)  thereby  increasing competition between providers, which
 will encourage higher-quality service at lower prices,  (5)  eliminating
 barriers  to  market  entry  for  such  new  providers, and (6) creating
 protections and incentives for existing providers to expand coverage and
 service for consumers of abortion-related services.
  (g) Another specific intent of this act is to accord all patients  who
 travel  to New York, and the abortion-service providers in New York, the
 constitutional protections of Article VI of the United States  Constitu-
 tion, section 2, clause 1 (the Privileges and Immunities Clause), and of
 the  due  process  clause  of  the fourteenth amendment, which prohibits
 states where abortion is either illegal or restricted  from  either  (1)
 punishing  its  residents  who travel out-of-state for such services, or
 (2) restraining or seeking to punish providers, or others who assist  or
 facilitate lawful abortions in New York, as well as the equal protection
 clause  of  the fourteenth amendment which prohibits states from denying
 to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the  laws.
 "The tradition of American federalism stands squarely against efforts by
 states  to  punish  their  citizens for conduct that is protected in the
 sister state where it occurs."
  (h) Because providers and common  carriers  who  participate  in  this
 newly  enacted program are acting at the behest of New York state, under
 duly executed contracts with the state to perform public  service  on  a
 temporary  or  occasional  basis,  and in compliance with New York state
 regulations, and because  using  existing  providers  will  create  less
 burden  to  New York taxpayers than increasing abortion services already
 provided by the state-run healthcare facilities, and because the  threat
 of  liability has the effect of deterring skilled and qualified individ-
 uals from public service, it is the intent of the legislature to  afford
 immunity from suit or prosecution to any abortion-service provider with-
 in  New  York  state  who  provides abortion services to an out-of-state
 patient, whether through telehealth or in-person, as well as  to  common
 carriers  and  hotels,  who  participate in this program under contracts
 with the state.
  § 3. Travel to New York for abortions and related care.  (a)  Patients
 living  in  the 50 U.S. States and territories, who (1) seek an abortion
 that is unlawful or unavailable in their state of residence but is legal
 and available in New York, and (2) declare financial  need  to  pay  for
 such  medical  care  or  travel  to  New York, are eligible to apply for
 financial assistance to travel  to  New  York  to  obtain  such  medical
 services referred to in this act as "the travel program" or "program".

  (b) On an annual basis, the department of health, in consultation with
 the  not-for-profit corporation created for this purpose, as provided in
 subdivision (c) of section four of  this  act,  shall  promulgate  rules
 setting  forth the financial qualifications for obtaining such financial
 assistance.
  (c) Such rules shall be based upon the patient's declaration of finan-
 cial means.
  (d)  Such  rules  shall aim to maximize the availability of funds from
 all sources.
  (e) To the extent permitted by law, such rules shall  seek  to  obtain
 reimbursement from the patient's health insurance.
  (f)  Immigration  status  shall  not be a consideration in determining
 financial eligibility or participation in the program  in  any  way.  No
 information on legal immigration or residency status may be collected in
 connection with this program.
  §  4.  Administration.  (a) The department of health shall promulgate
 rules and regulations consistent with this act within  60  days  of  the
 effective date of this act.
  (b) The travel program shall be funded through an annual appropriation
 beginning in fiscal year 2023-2024.
  (c)  The  department  of  health  shall create a not-for-profit corpo-
 ration, to be known as the "New York sanctuary project",  to  administer
 the travel program and shall issue regulations to:
  (1)  Administer  the  travel  program,  including  facilitating travel
 arrangements and medical appointments for persons who declare  the  need
 for them, and paying the costs when funds are available.
  (2)  Protect  the personally identifiable data of any person or entity
 that contacts, applies for,  or  receives  assistance  from  the  travel
 program,  in  perpetuity  and  collect as little personally identifiable
 data as practicable. All travel program partners shall take  all  neces-
 sary steps to ensure the confidentiality of the individuals and entities
 receiving services or funds from the travel program.
  (3)  Enter into contracts with providers of abortion services (whether
 in-person or through telehealth options), which will require the provid-
 ers to act in conformance with contractual requirements, comply with all
 applicable laws or regulations, and certify compliance with same.
  (4) Issue certificates of immunity to all providers and common  carri-
 ers  who  provide  abortion  services on a temporary or occasional basis
 under the travel program.
  (5) Raise private money to help pay for the travel program.
  (6) Enter into partnerships, separately or in cooperation  with  other
 sanctuary  states,  with  existing,  privately run not-for-profit corpo-
 rations that can contribute funds  or  other  resources  to  the  travel
 program.
  (7)  Maximize  the  availability  of funds from sources other than New
 York, such as,  where  eligible,  the  patient's  private  insurance  or
 private donations.
  (8)  Enter  into  agreements  with  common carriers, hotel chains, and
 other service providers, separately or in cooperation with other sanctu-
 ary  states,  for  the  purpose  of  administering  the  travel  program
 resources in a cost-efficient and compassionate manner.
  (9) Broadly advertise the availability of, and the application process
 for, the travel program in all 50 states and territories.
  (10)  Provide  a  fast-track option, in which applicants for financial
 assistance receive notice of  the  determination  on  their  application
 within 48 hours of the application's receipt, or such other time limita-

 tion  as  determined  by the department of health or in cooperation with
 other sanctuary states.
  (11)  Advertise  the  availability  of  the  program, including within
 states that have or will restrict or ban access to abortion services.
  (12) Establish a panel of qualified pro bono lawyers, in  coordination
 with the existing reproductive legal defense networks, to defend persons
 and  providers  sued  or charged with abortion-related claims or crimes,
 wherever those suits are brought.
  § 5. Telehealth provisions.  (a) As part of the program,  the  depart-
 ment of health's regulations shall permit, to the maximum extent permit-
 ted  by state and federal law, health care practitioners within New York
 to provide medical abortions to out-of-state residents through mail-ord-
 er pharmacies and telehealth consultations, in which the  patient  would
 use  the  abortifacient  medication  in their home state, or in a nearby
 state (the "telehealth option").
  (b) All medical services provided by New York health care  practition-
 ers and their staff, including the services of pharmacies where applica-
 ble,  for  the telehealth option are hereby deemed to be provided within
 the state of New York, regardless of where the patient resides.
  (c) All protections that have been enacted  to  protect  patients  and
 health care practitioners engaged in abortion care within New York shall
 also  apply  to  telehealth  abortions,  including protections from acts
 against health care practitioners' licenses, against health care practi-
 tioners' liability insurance, against health care practitioners' proper-
 ty, and  involving  any  criminal  complaints  or  extradition  attempts
 related to abortion care.
  § 6. Subdivision 1 of section 17 of the public officers law is amended
 by adding a new paragraph (aa) to read as follows:
  (AA)  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION, THE TERM "EMPLOYEE" SHALL
 INCLUDE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND MEMBERS OF  THE  BOARD  OF  THE  TRAVEL
 PROGRAM,  AND  ALL  PROVIDERS  AND  COMMON CARRIERS WHO PROVIDE ABORTION
 SERVICES UNDER THE TRAVEL PROGRAM, AS ESTABLISHED BY A  CHAPTER  OF  THE
 LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE WHICH ADDED THIS PARAGRAPH.
  § 7. Severability. If any provision, section, subsection, or clause of
 this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held inval-
 id,  it  is the legislature's intent that the invalidity does not affect
 other provisions, sections, subsections, clauses or applications of this
 act which can be given effect without the  invalid  provision,  section,
 subsection,  or clause or application, and to this end the provisions of
 this act are severable.
  § 8. This act shall take effect immediately.
