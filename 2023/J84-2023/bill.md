  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
citizens of New York State who take the time to ensure the foundation of
American Democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS, The right to a trial by jury is one of the core  values  of
American citizenship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  obligation  and  privilege to serve as a juror are as
fundamental to our democracy as the right to vote; and
 
  WHEREAS, The right to trial by jury has its roots in English  common
law and was included in the Declaration of Independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  right  to  trial  by  jury  was  enshrined  in  the
Constitution in Article 3 Section 2 as well as in the 6th  Amendment  of
the Bill of Rights which guarantees the right to an impartial jury; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Service  by  citizens  as  jurors  is indispensable to the
judicial system; and
 
  WHEREAS, All citizens should be encouraged to respond when  summoned
for jury service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  continuing and imperative goal for the courts, the bar,
and the broader community is to ensure  that  jury  selection  and  jury
service are fair, effective, and not unduly burdensome on anyone; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the most significant actions a court system can take
is  to  show  appreciation  for  the jury system and for the hundreds of
thousands of citizens who annually give their time and talents to  serve
on juries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  10-14,  2023,  as
Juror Appreciation Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
