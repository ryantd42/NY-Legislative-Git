 EARNED INCOME CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER SECTION THIRTY-TWO  OF  THE  INTERNAL
 REVENUE CODE FOR THE SAME TAXABLE YEAR, AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH ONE OF
 THIS SUBSECTION, SHALL BE REDUCED TO TEN;
  (D)  IN  THE  FOURTH  TAXABLE  YEAR  SUCCEEDING  THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

  THE  REDUCTION  DESCRIBED  IN  THIS  PARAGRAPH SHALL APPLY ONLY TO THE
 PORTION OF A TAXPAYER'S EARNED INCOME CREDIT  THAT  IS  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO

 the  Internal Revenue Code, the credit shall only be equal to the appli-
 cable percentage of the child tax  credit  allowed  the  taxpayer  under
 section  24  of the Internal Revenue Code for each qualifying child. For
 the purposes of this subsection, a qualifying child shall be a child who
 meets the definition of qualified  child  under  section  24(c)  of  the
 internal  revenue  code. The applicable percentage shall be thirty-three
 percent. For purposes of this subsection, any reference to section 24 of

 DATE OF THIS SUBSECTION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE  PREPAY-
 MENT  OF THE WORKING FAMILIES CREDIT UNDER THIS SUBSECTION TO QUALIFYING
 TAXPAYERS.  FOUR ADVANCED PAYMENTS SHALL BE  MADE  TO  SUCH  QUALIFYING

 EXPECTATION  OF  ELIGIBILITY IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THEN THEY SHALL NOT BE
 HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INCORRECT PREPAYMENT/REFUND AMOUNT.
  (6) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE REFUNDA-
 BLE CREDIT AND ITS PAYMENT AUTHORIZED UNDER  THIS  SUBSECTION  SHALL  BE
 TREATED  IN  THE SAME MANNER AS THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND
 SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ASSETS, INCOME,  OR  RESOURCES  TO  THE  SAME
 EXTENT  THE  CREDIT  AND ITS PAYMENT WOULD BE DISREGARDED PURSUANT TO 26
 U.S.C. § 6409 AND THE GENERAL WELFARE DOCTRINE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMIN-
 ING ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS OR ASSISTANCE, OR THE AMOUNT OR  EXTENT  OF
 THOSE  BENEFITS OR ASSISTANCE, UNDER ANY STATE OR LOCAL PROGRAM, INCLUD-
 ING  BENEFITS  ESTABLISHED  UNDER  SECTION  NINETY-FIVE  OF  THE  SOCIAL
 SERVICES LAW.
