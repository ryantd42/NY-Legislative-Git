 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to a  New  York  state  working
  families tax credit

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subsection (d) of section  606  of  the  tax
 law,  as  amended  by  section  1 of part Q of chapter 63 of the laws of
 2000, is amended to read as follows:
  (1) General. A taxpayer WITH NO QUALIFYING  CHILD  AS  DEFINED  IN  26
 U.S.C.  §  152(C)  shall be allowed a credit as provided herein equal to
 (i) the applicable percentage of the earned income credit allowed  under
 section  thirty-two  of  the  internal revenue code for the same taxable
 year, (ii) reduced by the credit permitted under subsection (b) of  this
 section.
  § 2. Paragraph 1 of subsection (c-1) of section 606 of the tax law, as
 amended  by  section  1  of part P of chapter 59 of the laws of 2018, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (1) [A] FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST, TWO  THOU-
 SAND  TWENTY-FOUR,  A  resident  taxpayer  shall  be allowed a credit as
 provided herein equal to the greater of one hundred  dollars  times  the
 number of qualifying children of the taxpayer or the applicable percent-
 age  of  the child tax credit allowed the taxpayer under section twenty-
 four of the internal revenue code for the same  taxable  year  for  each
 qualifying  child.  Provided,  however,  in the case of a taxpayer whose
 federal adjusted gross income exceeds the  applicable  threshold  amount
 set  forth  by section 24(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, the credit
 shall only be equal to the applicable percentage of the child tax credit
 allowed the taxpayer under section 24 of the Internal Revenue  Code  for

 each qualifying child. For the purposes of this subsection, a qualifying
 child shall be a child who meets the definition of qualified child under
 section 24(c) of the internal revenue code and is at least four years of
 age.  The  applicable  percentage  shall  be  thirty-three  percent. For
 purposes of this subsection, any reference to section 24 of the Internal
 Revenue Code shall be a reference to such section as  it  existed  imme-
 diately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.
  §  3. Section 606 of the tax law is amended by adding a new subsection
 (c-2) to read as follows:
  (C-2) NEW YORK STATE WORKING FAMILIES  TAX  CREDIT.  (1)  FOR  TAXABLE
 YEARS  BEGINNING ON AND AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, A
 RESIDENT TAXPAYER WITH A NEW YORK STATE ADJUSTED GROSS  INCOME  OF  LESS
 THAN  TWENTY-FIVE  THOUSAND  DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS
 NOT MARRIED; FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF A  JOINT  RETURN;  OR
 TWENTY-FIVE  THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF A MARRIED INDIVIDUAL FILING
 A SEPARATE RETURN SHALL BE ALLOWED A CREDIT EQUAL TO ONE  THOUSAND  FIVE
 HUNDRED DOLLARS TIMES THE NUMBER OF QUALIFYING CHILDREN AS DEFINED IN 26
 U.S.C.  §  152 (C). THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT PER CHILD SHALL BE REDUCED,
 BUT NOT BELOW FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS, BY TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOU-
 SAND DOLLARS BY WHICH THE  TAXPAYER'S  NEW  YORK  STATE  ADJUSTED  GROSS
 INCOME EXCEEDS TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF AN INDIVIDUAL
 WHO  IS  NOT  MARRIED;  FIFTY  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  IN THE CASE OF A JOINT
 RETURN; OR TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF A  MARRIED  INDI-
 VIDUAL  FILING  A SEPARATE RETURN.  SUCH RESIDENT TAXPAYER MUST PROVIDE
 THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION  NUMBER
 FOR  EACH  QUALIFYING  CHILD IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT DESCRIBED IN
 THIS SUBSECTION.
  (2) FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE AND  THEREAFT-
 ER,  THE  THRESHOLDS  OF ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME AND THE CREDIT ALLOWED IN
 PARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS SUBSECTION  SHALL  BE  REVIEWED  ANNUALLY  BY  THE
 COMMISSIONER AND INDEXED FOR INFLATION.
  (3)  IF THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER THIS SUBSECTION FOR ANY
 TAXABLE YEAR SHALL EXCEED THE TAXPAYER'S TAX FOR SUCH YEAR,  THE  EXCESS
 SHALL  BE TREATED AS AN OVERPAYMENT OF TAX TO BE CREDITED OR REFUNDED IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-SIX OF THIS
 ARTICLE, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO INTEREST SHALL BE PAID THEREON.
  (4) IN THE CASE OF A HUSBAND AND WIFE WHO FILE A JOINT FEDERAL RETURN,
 BUT WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THEIR NEW YORK TAXES  SEPARATELY,  THE
 CREDIT  ALLOWED  PURSUANT  TO THIS SUBSECTION MAY BE APPLIED AGAINST THE
 TAX IMPOSED OF EITHER OR DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM AS THEY MAY ELECT.
  (5) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE PREPAYMENT OF  THE  WORKING
 FAMILIES  CREDIT  UNDER  THIS  SUBSECTION TO QUALIFYING TAXPAYERS.  FOUR
 ADVANCED PAYMENTS SHALL BE MADE TO SUCH QUALIFYING TAXPAYERS.  AN  ESTI-
 MATED  ANNUAL  TAX  CREDIT  SHALL  BE  DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER IN
 ADVANCE OF THE FIRST PAYMENT AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT  DUE  TO
 CHANGES  IN EMPLOYMENT OR FAMILY STATUS OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. THE
 FIRST THREE ADVANCED PAYMENTS SHALL BE MADE DURING THE TAXABLE YEAR  AND
 SHALL  BE  TWENTY PERCENT OF THE ANTICIPATED CREDIT. THE FOURTH ADVANCED
 PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE AFTER THE  END  OF  THE  TAX  YEAR  AND  SHALL  BE
 ADJUSTED  TO  MATCH  THE  ACTUAL CREDIT DUE. SUCH PAYMENTS SHALL, TO THE
 EXTENT PRACTICABLE, BE MADE AVAILABLE VIA DIRECT DEPOSIT AND  VIA  ELEC-
 TRONIC  BENEFIT  TRANSFER  (EBT)  CARD.  THE  COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE
 INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF  ADVANCED  PAYMENTS  OF  THE  WORKING
 FAMILIES  CREDIT  TO  TAX  PREPARERS, ACCOUNTANTS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT
 ASSIST  INDIVIDUALS  IN  TAX  PREPARATION.  SUCH  INFORMATION  SHALL  BE
 DISTRIBUTED TO QUALIFYING TAXPAYERS. IF A TAXPAYER ESTABLISHES THAT THEY
 A. 4022--A  3
 
 ARE REQUESTING AND RECEIVING PAYMENTS UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH IN GOOD FAITH
 BY  ESTABLISHING  THAT  THEY  PROPERLY  CLAIMED  PAYMENTS  UNDER  THIS
 SUBSECTION IN THE PRIOR YEAR  AND  THAT  THEY  HAVE  NOT  EXPERIENCED  A
 SUBSTANTIAL  CHANGE  IN  CIRCUMSTANCES  SUCH THAT THEY HAVE A REASONABLE
 EXPECTATION OF ELIGIBILITY IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THEN THEY SHALL  NOT  BE
 HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INCORRECT PREPAYMENT/REFUND AMOUNT.
  (6) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE REFUNDA-
 BLE  CREDIT  AND  ITS  PAYMENT AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS SUBSECTION SHALL BE
 TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX  CREDIT  AND
 SHALL  NOT  BE  CONSIDERED  AS  ASSETS, INCOME, OR RESOURCES TO THE SAME
 EXTENT THE CREDIT AND ITS PAYMENT WOULD BE DISREGARDED  PURSUANT  TO  26
 U.S.C. § 6409 AND THE GENERAL WELFARE DOCTRINE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMIN-
 ING  ELIGIBILITY  FOR BENEFITS OR ASSISTANCE, OR THE AMOUNT OR EXTENT OF
 THOSE BENEFITS OR ASSISTANCE, UNDER ANY STATE OR LOCAL PROGRAM,  INCLUD-
 ING  BENEFITS  ESTABLISHED  UNDER  SECTION  NINETY-FIVE  OF  THE  SOCIAL
 SERVICES LAW.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the  amend-
 ments  to paragraph  1  of subsection (d) of section 606 of the tax law,
 made  by section one of this act, shall apply to taxable years beginning
 on and after January 1, 2024.
