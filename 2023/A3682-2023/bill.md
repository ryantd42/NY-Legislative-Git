 Introduced  by M. of A. PRETLOW -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, the public service law,  and
  the  executive  law,  in  relation to reforming the telecommunications
  sector of the New York economy, by  creating  a  broadband  authority,
  authorizing statewide cable franchises for the purposes of competitive
  cable  service, promoting the wide-spread development of high-capacity
  broadband internet access, and increasing the availability and quality
  of services in this key economic development  area  and  ensuring  the
  safety, reliability and affordability of telecommunications services
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "omnibus telecommunications reform act".
  §  2. Legislative findings. 1. a. It is and has been the long-standing
 policy of the state of New York that every resident and business in  the
 state  of  New York has a right to have equal physical and social access
 to adequate telecommunications services at just  and  reasonable  rates,
 because  universal access to the benefits of telephony is fundamental to
 effective communication, quality of life, economic  development,  public
 safety  and  security, and democratic participation. Telecommunications,
 however, is undergoing dramatic changes with  new  technologies  driving
 the  ways  people  communicate with one another. No matter the source or
 vehicle by which people communicate with each other, the people of  this
 state  have  the right to adequate service at just and reasonable rates.
 Therefore, all telecommunications services must meet the highest  stand-
 ards  of  quality,  reliability,  and  safety--including  protecting and
 expanding the system of emergency 911 service--which requires sufficient
 investment in telecommunications infrastructure and, as  many  years  of
 experience  have  shown,  adequate  staffing provided by trained, career
 employees operating under the applicable safety codes and regulations.

  b. While  the  state's  long-standing  mission  has  been  to  provide
 universal, affordable and reliable service to all New Yorkers, all citi-
 zens  of  the state do not have equal access to communications technolo-
 gies that are becoming the standard bearers for  the  21st  century.  In
 fact, the state lags behind in deploying communication networks that are
 the  foundation  of modern telecommunications. The lack of deployment of
 high-capacity telecommunications infrastructure  services  ("broadband")
 in rural, underserved, unserved, economically distressed and other areas
 of the state is affected with a public interest; the rates, services and
 operations  of  cable  television  companies  are affected with a public
 interest and it is imperative that the state fairly regulate cable tele-
 vision services in the interest of the public, and; the public  interest
 is  furthered by comprehensive action in the area of telecommunications,
 and by the state's continued promotion of universally available telecom-
 munications services of  adequate  service  quality  and  at  affordable
 rates,  particularly  in  rural, high-cost and low income areas, and the
 state's entry into promoting the universal availability and physical and
 social access to  high-quality  broadband  and  advanced  communications
 services at affordable rates.
  c.  The  deployment  of  high-capacity  broadband  telecommunications
 networks and advanced communications networks throughout New  York  will
 promote  improvements  in healthcare, public safety, education, consumer
 choice, and the economy.
  d. State action and public-private  partnerships  will  be  needed  to
 deepen  investment  in,  promote  demand for, stimulate adoption of, and
 remove barriers to the development of universally  deployed  world-class
 high-capacity  broadband  networks,  providing  services to business and
 residential consumers in all areas of the state  at  competitive  prices
 with adequate service quality.
  e.  Reasonably  unfettered  access  of  the citizenry to the maximally
 diverse Internet is in the public interest, consistent however with  the
 need  or  company choice of telecommunications providers to block, limit
 or otherwise restrict the passage of electronic mail messages  or  other
 content that transmit, portray, describe, represent or otherwise contain
 matters  such  as child pornography or similar obscenity, other unlawful
 material, threats of serious bodily harm, threats to the  public  safety
 and  homeland  security,  threats  of  death to individuals or groups of
 individuals, viruses or similar computer  generated  programs  or  codes
 that have the potential to harm computer hardware and/or software and/or
 networks, excessive unsolicited commercial email that degrades or inter-
 feres  with  or  harms  the  normal operation of broadband networks, and
 other similar types or forms of  material  or  software  (the  foregoing
 examples  are  illustrative,  not  exhaustive  of  such threats to users
 and/or the network).
  2. a. New cable television services regulation is  necessary  to:  (i)
 promote  adequate,  affordable and efficient cable television service to
 the citizens and residents of the  state;  (ii)  encourage  the  optimum
 development  of the educational, government and community-service poten-
 tials of the cable television medium; (iii) provide just and  reasonable
 rates  for  cable  television service without geographic discrimination;
 (iv) protect the interests  of  the  municipalities  of  this  state  in
 relation  to  the  issuance  of municipal consents for the operations of
 cable television companies in those jurisdictions; (v)  to  protect  the
 right  of  consumers  to  access  the  lawful  internet content of their
 choice, to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to
 the requirements of law enforcement, and  to  connect  their  choice  of
 A. 3682  3

 legal  devices  that  do  not  harm the network; and (vi) cooperate with
 other states and with the federal government in promoting and coordinat-
 ing efforts to regulate  cable  television  effectively  in  the  public
 interest.
  b.  Competition  in the provisioning of cable service is emerging with
 the convergence of preexisting and new technologies for providing voice,
 video and data services, which results in increased  investment  in  the
 state, lower prices and improved service offerings for consumers.
  c. Increased investment and the potential for competition in the cable
 service  market  through the provisioning of new communications services
 and  deployment  of  advanced  communications  infrastructure  further
 enhances  economic  opportunities, public safety, and the overall health
 and well-being of the residents of the state.
  d. State-issued franchises for the provision  of  cable  service  will
 promote  and  facilitate the deployment of advanced technologies and new
 services to all classes of communities and protect New York's ability to
 compete in the national and international marketplace for  industry  and
 jobs.
  e.  Modifying  existing cable service regulation through the enactment
 of new standards and procedures that provide consumers with access to  a
 competitive  facilities-based  cable  market  and also preserves munici-
 palities historic authority to manage public  rights-of-way,  collect  a
 franchise  fee  up  to  five percent of gross revenue, administer public
 educational and government access channels, enforce consumer protections
 and ensure competitive cable services are delivered in a  nondiscrimina-
 tory manner is warranted in this state.
  f. Nothing in this act shall be seen to limit or reduce the protection
 afforded  to  cable  television  customers,  broadband internet services
 customers, telephone customers, and customers of advanced communications
 services generally, and it is in the  public  interest  to  ensure  that
 customers  continue  to  be provided a high level of customer protection
 and customer service in a more competitive market.
  3. Therefore, the legislature declares that the state needs to  funda-
 mentally  reform  the  three  key pillars of its vast telecommunications
 system--telephone, broadband internet access  and  cable  television--to
 provide  21st  Century technology to all New Yorkers that is safe, reli-
 able and affordable.

  § 4. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 92-j to
 read as follows:
  § 92-J. UNIVERSAL, AFFORDABLE AND SECURE  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES
 FUND.  1. THE COMMISSION SHALL ESTABLISH A MECHANISM FOR THE SUPPORT OF
 UNIVERSAL SERVICE, ALSO REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION AS  THE  "HIGH  COST
 SUPPORT MECHANISM", WHICH SHALL OPERATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULES ADOPTED
 BY  THE COMMISSION. THE PURPOSE OF THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECHANISM IS TO
 PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROVIDERS TO
 HELP MAKE BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE AND BROADBAND SERVICES UNIVERSALLY AVAIL-
 ABLE, AT JUST AND REASONABLE RATES AND ALLOW SUCH PROVIDERS TO BE  FULLY
 REIMBURSED  FOR  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REASONABLE COSTS INCURRED IN
 MAKING BASIC SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WITHIN A  RURAL,  HIGH
 COST  GEOGRAPHIC  SUPPORT  AREA  AND THE PRICE CHARGED FOR SUCH SERVICE,
 AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY SUCH  PROVIDERS  UNDER
 PRICE  SUPPORT  MECHANISMS  ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BY
 THIS STATE. THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  ENSURE  THAT  NO  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICES PROVIDER IS RECEIVING FUNDS FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER SOURCE THAT,
 TOGETHER  WITH  LOCAL  EXCHANGE  SERVICE  REVENUES,  EXCEEDS THE COST OF
 PROVIDING LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS OF SUCH PROVIDER. THE HIGH
 COST SUPPORT MECHANISM SHALL BE SUPPORTED AND DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY  AND
 ON  A  NONDISCRIMINATORY,  COMPETITIVELY  NEUTRAL  BASIS  THROUGH A RATE
 ELEMENT ASSESSED ON ALL  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICE  PROVIDERS  IN  NEW
 YORK.  A  PROVIDER THAT OFFERS BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICE OR BROADBAND
 SERVICE THROUGHOUT AN ENTIRE SUPPORT AREA THROUGH USE OF ITS OWN FACILI-
 TIES OR ON A RESALE BASIS MAY BE QUALIFIED AS A PROVIDER OF LAST  RESORT
 OR  MAY  BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT, AS DETERMINED
 BY THE COMMISSION. A PROVIDER THAT FAILS TO PAY AN  ASSESSMENT  DUE  AND
 PAYABLE UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE REVOCATION OF CERTIF-
 ICATE AFTER NOTICE AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING AS PROVIDED IN THIS
 CHAPTER.  IN  ALL  RELEVANT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE, AS DEFINED BY
 THE COMMISSION, THE COMMISSION SHALL DESIGNATE AT LEAST ONE PROVIDER  AS
 THE  PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AND ADOPT PROCEDURES FOR CHANGING OR TERMI-
 NATING SUCH DESIGNATIONS. A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT DESIGNATION  CARRIES
 THE  RESPONSIBILITY  TO OFFER BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICE AND BROADBAND
 SERVICE TO ALL CONSUMERS WHO REQUEST IT. A PERSON HOLDING A  CERTIFICATE
 OF  PUBLIC  CONVENIENCE  AND NECESSITY TO PROVIDE BASIC SERVICE SHALL BE
 SUBJECT TO THE EVOLVING DEFINITION OF BASIC  SERVICE  DEVELOPED  BY  THE
 COMMISSION  UNDER  THIS  CHAPTER AND THE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR
 UNIVERSAL SERVICE ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION UNDER THIS  SECTION.  IF
 AND  WHEN  ADDITIONAL  ELEMENTS  ARE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF BASIC
 SERVICE AS A RESULT OF REVIEW BY THE COMMISSION, PRICES MAY INCREASE  AS
 IS  DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSION TO BE REASONABLY NECESSARY TO COVER THE
 COST AND ACCOUNT FOR THE INCLUSION OF SUCH ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS.
  2. ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER FIRST OF  EACH  YEAR,  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL
 SUBMIT  A  WRITTEN  REPORT  TO  THE GOVERNOR, TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE
 SENATE, SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, MINORITY  LEADERS  OF  THE  SENATE  AND
 ASSEMBLY,  CHAIRPERSON  AND RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE ENERGY
 AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, AND THE CHAIRPERSON AND RANKING MINOR-
 ITY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY  CORPORATIONS,  AUTHORITIES  AND  COMMISSIONS
 COMMITTEE,  ACCOUNTING  FOR THE OPERATION OF THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECH-
 A. 3682  18
 
 ANISM DURING THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR AND  CONTAINING  THE  FOLLOWING
 INFORMATION, AT A MINIMUM:
  (A)  THE  TOTAL  AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMMISSION DETERMINED SHOULD
 CONSTITUTE THE HIGH COST  SUPPORT  MECHANISM  FROM  WHICH  DISTRIBUTIONS
 WOULD BE MADE;
  (B) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY ORDERED TO BE CONTRIBUTED THROUGH A RATE
 ELEMENT  ASSESSMENT COLLECTED BY EACH TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVID-
 ER;
  (C) THE BASIS ON WHICH THE  CONTRIBUTION  OF  EACH  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDER WAS CALCULATED;
  (D)  THE  BENCHMARKS  USED  AND THE BASIS ON WHICH THE BENCHMARKS WERE
 DETERMINED;
  (E) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMMISSION DETERMINED SHOULD BE
 DISTRIBUTED FROM THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECHANISM;
  (F) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY DISTRIBUTED TO  EACH  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDER FROM THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECHANISM;
  (G)  THE BASIS ON WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
 PROVIDERS WAS CALCULATED;
  (H)  AS  TO  EACH  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICE  PROVIDER  RECEIVING  A
 DISTRIBUTION, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY GEOGRAPHIC SUPPORT AREA AND TYPE OF
 CUSTOMER,  THE  WAY IN WHICH THE BENEFIT OF THE DISTRIBUTION WAS APPLIED
 OR ACCOUNTED FOR;
  (I)  THE  PROPOSED  BENCHMARKS,  THE  PROPOSED  CONTRIBUTIONS  TO  BE
 COLLECTED  THROUGH  A RATE ELEMENT ASSESSMENT BY EACH TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDER, AND THE PROPOSED TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE HIGH COST SUPPORT
 MECHANISM FROM WHICH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE TO  BE  MADE  FOR  THE  FOLLOWING
 CALENDAR YEAR; AND
  (J)  THE  TOTAL  AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTIONS MADE FROM THE HIGH COST FUND,
 DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AND HOW THEY ARE BALANCED BY RATE REDUCTIONS  BY
 ALL  PROVIDERS  FOR  THE SAME PERIOD AND A FULL ACCOUNTING OF AND JUSTI-
 FICATION FOR ANY DIFFERENCE. IF THE REPORT SUBMITTED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 SUBDIVISION  CONTAINS  A  PROPOSAL FOR AN INCREASE IN ANY OF THE AMOUNTS
 LISTED IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS  SUBDIVISION,  SUCH  INCREASE  SHALL  BE
 SUSPENDED UNTIL MARCH THIRTY-FIRST OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR.
  SUCH  REPORT  MUST  ALSO DETERMINE WHAT AMOUNT OF UNEXPENDED FUNDS, IF
 ANY, AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, COULD BE REFUNDED TO THE CONTRIBUT-
 ING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROVIDERS ON A  BASIS  THAT  IS  PROPOR-
 TIONAL  TO  THE  AMOUNTS CONTRIBUTED BY SUCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
 PROVIDERS.
  3. THERE IS HEREBY CREATED, IN THE STATE TREASURY, THE NEW  YORK  HIGH
 COST  ADMINISTRATION  FUND,  REFERRED  TO IN THIS SECTION AS THE "FUND",
 WHICH SHALL BE USED TO REIMBURSE THE COMMISSION AND, IF APPLICABLE,  ITS
 CONTRACTORS,  FOR  REASONABLE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF
 THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECHANISM AS DETERMINED BY RULES  OF  THE  COMMIS-
 SION, AND SHALL BE AUDITED IN A MANNER AND FREQUENCY TO BE DETERMINED BY
 THE  COMPTROLLER.  THE  MONEYS  IN  THE FUND THAT ARE TO BE USED FOR THE
 DIRECT AND INDIRECT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION  AND
 ITS  CONTRACTORS  SHALL  BE APPROPRIATED ANNUALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE. AT
 THE END OF ANY FISCAL YEAR, ALL UNEXPENDED AND  UNENCUMBERED  MONEYS  IN
 THE  FUND  SHALL REMAIN THEREIN AND SHALL NOT BE CREDITED OR TRANSFERRED
 TO THE GENERAL FUND OR ANY OTHER FUND. BASED UPON THE BALANCE  REMAINING
 IN  THE FUND AND THE AMOUNT APPROPRIATED ANNUALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR
 USE BY THE COMMISSION, EACH YEAR  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  DETERMINE  THE
 NONDISCRIMINATORY,  COMPETITIVELY NEUTRAL ASSESSMENT ON ALL TELECOMMUNI-
 CATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN NEW YORK THAT WILL BE  NECESSARY  TO  COVER
 THE  COST  OF  IMPLEMENTING  THE HIGH COST SUPPORT MECHANISM.  ONLY THE
 A. 3682  19
 
 MONEYS FROM SUCH ASSESSMENT SHALL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE STATE TREASURER,
 WHO SHALL CREDIT THE SAME TO THE FUND. ALL  INTEREST  DERIVED  FROM  THE
 DEPOSIT  AND  INVESTMENT OF THIS FUND SHALL REMAIN IN THE FUND AND SHALL
 NOT REVERT TO THE GENERAL FUND.

 DISAPPROVE THE APPLICATION IN WRITING CITING THE REASONS FOR DISAPPROVAL
 IF  THE  BOARD DETERMINES THAT THE APPLICATION FOR A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE
 DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR  A  STATEWIDE  FRANCHISE.  THE
 COMMISSION MAY DENY THE APPLICATION IF THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED TO STATE
 IN  THE  APPLICATION  THE  INFORMATION  AND  REPRESENTATIONS REQUIRED BY
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION. IF THE COMMISSION DENIES  THE  APPLICA-
 TION,  IT  MUST SPECIFY WITH PARTICULARITY THE REASON OR REASONS FOR THE
 DENIAL, AND THE APPLICANT MAY AMEND ITS APPLICATION TO  CURE  ANY  DEFI-
 CIENCY.  THE COMMISSION SHALL DECIDE SUCH AMENDED APPLICATION WITHIN TEN
 BUSINESS DAYS OF ITS SUBMISSION TO THE COMMISSION BY THE APPLICANT.  IF
 THE  COMMISSION  DENIES THE APPLICATION, THE COMMISSION SHALL SCHEDULE A
 PUBLIC MEETING WITH THE  APPLICANT  TO  EXPLAIN  TO  THE  APPLICANT  THE
 REASONS  FOR  THE COMMISSION'S DISAPPROVAL. SUCH MEETING SHALL BE SCHED-
 ULED NO LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF THE SIXTY-DAY
 REVIEW PERIOD AS REQUIRED BY THIS  SECTION.  THE  APPLICANT  SHALL  HAVE
 THIRTY  DAYS  FOLLOWING  THE  DATE OF THE MEETING WITH THE COMMISSION TO
 FILE AN APPEAL OF THE BOARD'S DECISION. THE COMMISSION SHALL  THEREAFTER
 SCHEDULE  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  HEARING  NOT  LATER THAN THE THIRTIETH DAY
 FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE APPLICANT'S APPEAL IN  ORDER  TO
 CONSIDER  THE  APPLICANT'S  APPEAL.  THE  COMMISSION SHALL ISSUE A FINAL
 DECISION IN WRITTEN FORM ON THE APPLICANT'S APPEAL NOT  LATER  THAN  THE
 SIXTIETH  DAY  FOLLOWING  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  HEARING, REQUIRED BY THIS
 SUBDIVISION, ON THE APPLICANT'S APPEAL. AFTER AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  PERIOD
 AN APPLICANT MAY CHALLENGE A DENIAL OF ITS APPLICATION OR AMENDED APPLI-
 CATION IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
  6.  A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE AUTHORIZATION ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION SHALL
 CONTAIN:
  (A) A GRANT OF A FRANCHISE TO PROVIDE CABLE  SERVICE  IN  THE  SERVICE
 AREA  FOOTPRINT  DESCRIBED  IN  THE  APPLICATION; TO CONSTRUCT, UPGRADE,
 OPERATE OR MAINTAIN A NETWORK CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SUCH SERVICE,  EXCEPT

 A. 3682  25
 
  (B) A STATEMENT THAT THE FRANCHISE GRANT IN SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS
 SECTION  IS  SUBJECT  TO  LAWFUL  OPERATION  OF THE CABLE SERVICE BY THE
 APPLICANT OR ITS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST.
  7.  AN  APPLICANT  HAVING PRE-EXISTING AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE THE PUBLIC
 RIGHTS-OF-WAY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE PRIOR  TO  THE
 ACTUAL  PROVISION  OF  CABLE  SERVICE  ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS DIRECTLY TO
 SUBSCRIBERS. HOWEVER, SUCH AN APPLICANT IS  NOT  REQUIRED  TO  OBTAIN  A
 STATEWIDE  FRANCHISE OR ANY MUNICIPALITY AUTHORIZATION, EXCEPT FOR BEING
 SUBJECT  TO  MUNICIPALITY  RIGHT-OF-WAY  REQUIREMENTS,  IN  ORDER  TO
 CONSTRUCT,  UPGRADE,  OPERATE  OR  MAINTAIN A NETWORK THAT IS CAPABLE OF
 PROVIDING CABLE SERVICE.

 THE COMMISSION SHALL BE VALID FOR TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE  OF  ISSUANCE.
 RENEWAL OF A SYSTEMWIDE FRANCHISE SHALL BE VALID FOR A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN
 YEARS  FROM  THE  DATE OF THE RENEWAL ISSUANCE, AND THE COMMISSION SHALL
 ESTABLISH RULES GOVERNING THE RENEWAL OF A SYSTEMWIDE FRANCHISE.
  § 236. TERMINATION OF A STATEWIDE  FRANCHISE.  1.  A  FRANCHISE  SHALL
 TERMINATE  AT THE EXPIRATION OF ITS TERM OR OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS THEREOF, UNLESS, PRIOR THERETO, THE COMMISSION  OTHERWISE
 ORDERS.  THE  COMMISSION  MAY  SO  ORDER  ONLY IF IT FINDS, AFTER PUBLIC
 NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING, THAT THE FRANCHISEE:
  (A) HAS COMMITTED A MATERIAL BREACH OF ITS FRANCHISE OR ANY APPLICABLE
 PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE OR OF THE  REGULATIONS  PROMULGATED  HEREUNDER
 AND  HAS  FAILED,  WITHOUT REASONABLE JUSTIFICATION, TO CURE SAID BREACH
 WITHIN SIXTY DAYS AFTER HAVING RECEIVED WRITTEN NOTICE THEREOF FROM  THE
 COMMISSION; OR
  (B)  HAS  NOT MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS TWO HUNDRED FORTY-THREE
 AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE;
  (C) HAS ENGAGED IN BLOCKING OF LAWFUL CONTENT ON WEB SITES OR SERVICES
 OF COMPETITORS, OR REFUSED  TO  INTERCONNECT  ITS  FACILITIES  WITH  THE
 FACILITIES  OF ANOTHER PROVIDER OF BROADBAND NETWORK SERVICES ON REASON-
 ABLE AND NONDISCRIMINATORY TERMS OR CONDITIONS; OR
  (D) HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED A BANKRUPT OR HAS FILED A VOLUNTARY  PETITION
 FOR  BANKRUPTCY  OR REORGANIZATION OR FOR AN ORDER PROTECTING ITS ASSETS
 FROM THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS AND THE COMMISSION FINDS  THAT  TERMINATION
 OF THE FRANCHISE OR CERTIFICATE OF CONFIRMATION UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IS
 IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC.
  2. UPON TERMINATION OF A FRANCHISE OR CERTIFICATE OF CONFIRMATION, THE
 CABLE  OPERATOR  SHALL  DISPOSE OF ITS FACILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF THE FRANCHISE OR CERTIFICATE. HOWEVER, ON  MOTION  OF  ANY
 INTERESTED  PARTY  OR  UPON  ITS OWN MOTION, AND AFTER PUBLIC NOTICE AND
 OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING, IF THE  COMMISSION  FINDS  THAT  THE  CONTINUED
 PRESENCE  OF  THE  FACILITIES  IN  ANY  PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE WOULD POSE A
 NUISANCE TO THE MUNICIPALITY OR ITS RESIDENTS, THE OPERATOR SHALL REMOVE
 ITS FACILITIES WITHIN SUCH PERIOD AS THE COMMISSION SHALL ORDER. IN  THE
 ABSENCE OF ANY APPLICABLE FRANCHISE OR CERTIFICATE PROVISION OR ORDER BY
 THE COMMISSION TO THE CONTRARY, THE CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY MAY ABANDON
 ITS FACILITIES.
  §  237.  ABANDONMENT  OF SERVICE. 1. NO CABLE OPERATOR MAY ABANDON ANY
 SERVICE OR PORTION THEREOF WITHOUT  GIVING  SIX  MONTHS'  PRIOR  WRITTEN
 NOTICE TO THE COMMISSION AND TO THE FRANCHISOR, IF ANY, AND TO THE MUNI-
 CIPALITIES IT SERVES.
  2.  WHEN  ABANDONMENT  OF ANY SERVICE IS PROHIBITED BY A FRANCHISE, NO
 CABLE OPERATOR MAY ABANDON SUCH SERVICE WITHOUT WRITTEN CONSENT  OF  THE
 A. 3682  26
 
 COMMISSION.  IN  GRANTING  SUCH  CONSENT, THE COMMISSION MAY IMPOSE SUCH
 TERMS, CONDITIONS OR REQUIREMENTS AS IN ITS JUDGMENT  ARE  NECESSARY  TO
 PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
  §  238. MUNICIPAL POWER AND REGULATION OVER FRANCHISE HOLDERS. A MUNI-
 CIPALITY MAY:
  1. EXERCISE ITS PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY AUTHORITY OVER FRANCHISE HOLDERS,
 INCLUDING REQUIRING FRANCHISE HOLDERS TO FOLLOW MUNICIPAL ORDINANCES  AS
 WELL AS ALL APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS;
  2. RECEIVE, MEDIATE, AND RESOLVE CABLE SERVICE QUALITY COMPLAINTS FROM
 A FRANCHISE HOLDER'S CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY;
  3.  REQUIRE  A  FRANCHISE HOLDER WHO IS PROVIDING CABLE SERVICE WITHIN
 THE MUNICIPALITY TO REGISTER WITH THE MUNICIPALITY, MAINTAIN A POINT  OF
 CONTACT,  AND  PROVIDE NOTICE OF ANY FRANCHISE AUTHORIZATION TRANSFER TO
 THE MUNICIPALITY WITHIN FOURTEEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE  COMPLETION  OF
 THE TRANSFER;
  4. ESTABLISH REASONABLE GUIDELINES REGARDING THE USE OF PUBLIC, EDUCA-
 TIONAL,  AND  GOVERNMENTAL  ACCESS  CHANNELS  WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY IN
 ADDITION TO THOSE ESTABLISHED IN SECTION TWO HUNDRED FORTY-ONE  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE.
  § 239. PAYMENT AND REMITTANCE OF FRANCHISE FEE. 1. THE FRANCHISE HOLD-
 ER  WHO  OFFERS  CABLE SERVICE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A MUNICIPALITY
 SHALL CALCULATE AND REMIT TO THE MUNICIPALITY AT THE END OF EACH  CALEN-
 DAR YEAR QUARTER A FRANCHISE FEE, AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. THE OBLI-
 GATION TO CALCULATE AND REMIT THE FRANCHISE FEE TO A MUNICIPALITY BEGINS
 IMMEDIATELY  UPON  PROVISION OF CABLE SERVICE WITHIN THAT MUNICIPALITY'S
 JURISDICTION, BUT THE FIRST REMITTANCE SHALL NOT BE DUE UNTIL THE END OF
 THE FIRST CALENDAR YEAR QUARTER THAT IS LATER THAN  ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY
 DAYS AFTER THE PROVISION OF CABLE SERVICE BEGAN.
  2.  THE FRANCHISE FEE SHALL BE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE HOLD-
 ER'S GROSS REVENUES, AS DEFINED IN SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  THIRTY-ONE  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  AND  SHALL BE FIVE PERCENT.  A MUNICIPALITY MAY, BY ORDI-
 NANCE, CHANGE THE PERCENTAGE APPLIED TO THE GROSS REVENUES OF THE  HOLD-
 ER.
  3.  NO  FEE  UNDER THIS SECTION WILL BECOME DUE UNTIL THE MUNICIPALITY
 CERTIFIES AND PROVIDES DOCUMENTATION TO THE FRANCHISE HOLDER  SUPPORTING
 THE  PERCENTAGE  PAID  BY  ANY INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATOR SERVING THE AREA
 WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY'S JURISDICTION.
  4. NO MUNICIPALITY OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISION  OF  THIS  STATE
 MAY  ASSESS ANY ADDITIONAL FEES OR CHARGES OR REQUIRE OTHER REMUNERATION
 OF ANY KIND FROM THE FRANCHISE HOLDER OTHER THAN AS SET  FORTH  IN  THIS
 SECTION,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT THE PROVISION OF IN-KIND SERVICES OR
 SUPPORT, PERSONNEL AND FUNDING  DEDICATED  TO  PUBLIC,  EDUCATIONAL  AND
 GOVERNMENT  FACILITIES  AND  SERVICES SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED ADDITIONAL
 FEES, CHARGES OR REMUNERATION.
  5. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, IN THE CASE OF A CABLE  SERVICE  THAT
 MAY BE BUNDLED OR INTEGRATED FUNCTIONALLY WITH OTHER SERVICES, CAPABILI-
 TIES  OR  APPLICATIONS,  THE  FRANCHISE FEE SHALL BE APPLIED ONLY TO THE
 GROSS REVENUES, AS  DEFINED  IN  THIS  ARTICLE,  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  CABLE
 SERVICE  OR  THE USE OF THE CABLE SYSTEM AND FACILITIES, AS REFLECTED ON
 THE BOOKS AND  RECORDS  OF  THE  HOLDER  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  GENERALLY
 ACCEPTED  ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES  AND  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
 RULES, REGULATIONS, STANDARDS OR ORDERS, AS APPLICABLE.
  6. THE FRANCHISE FEE SHALL BE REMITTED TO THE APPLICABLE  MUNICIPALITY
 QUARTERLY,  WITHIN  FORTY-FIVE DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE QUARTER FOR THE
 PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER. EACH  PAYMENT  SHALL  BE  ACCOMPANIED  BY  A
 SUMMARY  EXPLAINING  THE BASIS FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE FRANCHISE FEE.
 A. 3682  27
 
 NOT MORE THAN ONCE ANNUALLY, A MUNICIPALITY MAY  EXAMINE  THE  FRANCHISE
 HOLDER'S  BUSINESS  RECORDS TO THE EXTENT REASONABLY NECESSARY TO ENSURE
 COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION. EACH PARTY SHALL BEAR  THE
 PARTY'S  OWN COSTS OF THE EXAMINATION. ANY CLAIMS BY A MUNICIPALITY THAT
 COMPENSATION IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION, AND ANY CLAIMS  FOR
 REFUNDS  OR OTHER CORRECTIONS TO THE REMITTANCE OF THE FRANCHISE HOLDER,
 MUST BE MADE WITHIN THREE YEARS AND FORTY-FIVE DAYS OF THE  END  OF  THE
 QUARTER FOR WHICH COMPENSATION IS REMITTED, OR THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE
 OF  REMITTANCE,  WHICHEVER  IS LATER. EITHER A MUNICIPALITY OR THE FRAN-
 CHISE HOLDER MAY, IN THE EVENT  OF  A  DISPUTE  CONCERNING  COMPENSATION
 UNDER  THIS  SECTION,  BRING AN ACTION IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDIC-
 TION.
  § 240. PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENT CHANNELS. 1. IN ADDITION  TO
 THE  REQUIREMENTS  SET  FORTH  IN 16 NYCRR SEC. 894.4 (AS MAY BE AMENDED
 FROM TIME TO TIME), THE FRANCHISE HOLDER SHALL PROVIDE THE  MUNICIPALITY
 WITH  CAPACITY  IN  ITS  CABLE  SYSTEM TO ALLOW PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND
 GOVERNMENTAL (PEG) ACCESS CHANNELS FOR  NONCOMMERCIAL  PROGRAMMING.  FOR
 THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS SECTION, PEG CHANNELS SHALL BE DEFINED AS ANALOG
 CHANNELS OF SIX MEGAHERTZ BANDWIDTH OR THE SAME AS ANY OTHER CHANNEL  ON
 THE  BASIC  TIER,  WHICHEVER IS GREATER. IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENTS
 SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL RULES  OR
 GUIDELINES  REGARDING  PEG ACCESS CHANNELS. THE HOLDER SHALL PROVIDE THE
 SAME ANCILLARY SERVICES TO THE PEG CHANNELS AND ENTITIES AS  THE  INCUM-
 BENT PROVIDER.
  2. THE FRANCHISE HOLDER SHALL DESIGNATE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CAPACI-
 TY  ON ITS CABLE SYSTEM TO ALLOW THE PROVISION OF A COMPARABLE NUMBER OF
 PEG CHANNELS OR HOURS OF PROGRAMMING THAT THE INCUMBENT  CABLE  OPERATOR
 HAS  ACTIVATED  AND  PROVIDED WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY UNDER THE TERMS OF
 ITS FRANCHISE AGREEMENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE.  IF  A
 MUNICIPALITY DID NOT HAVE PEG ACCESS CHANNELS AS OF THAT DATE, THE CABLE
 OPERATOR  SHALL FURNISH TO THE MUNICIPALITY UPON REQUEST UP TO THREE PEG
 CHANNELS FOR A MUNICIPALITY WITH A POPULATION OF AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND
 AND UP TO TWO PEG CHANNELS FOR A MUNICIPALITY WITH A POPULATION OF  LESS
 THAN  FIFTY THOUSAND. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A PEG CHANNEL IS
 DEEMED ACTIVATED IF IT IS BEING UTILIZED FOR PEG PROGRAMMING WITHIN  THE
 MUNICIPALITY FOR AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS PER DAY AND IF SUCH PROGRAMMING IS
 NOT BROADCAST MORE THAN ONCE IN EVERY EIGHT HOURS. THE HOLDER SHALL HAVE
 TWELVE  MONTHS FROM THE DATE THE MUNICIPALITY REQUESTS SUCH PEG CHANNELS
 TO DESIGNATE THE CAPACITY;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THE  TWELVE-MONTH
 PERIOD  SHALL  BE  TOLLED  BY ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH THE DESIGNATION OR
 PROVISION OF PEG CHANNEL CAPACITY IS TECHNICALLY  INFEASIBLE,  INCLUDING
 ANY  FAILURE  OR  DELAY OF THE INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATOR TO MAKE ADEQUATE
 INTERCONNECTION AVAILABLE, AS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION. IN CITIES WITH A
 POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE PERSONS, IF A SYSTEM HAS  TOTAL  ACTI-
 VATED  BANDWIDTH  IN EXCESS OF EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO MEGAHERTZ THEN AT
 LEAST TWO ADDITIONAL PEG CHANNELS SHALL BE  SET  ASIDE  BY  THE  HOLDER,
 INCLUDING ONE FOR PUBLIC ACCESS.
  3. THE FRANCHISE HOLDER MAY SUBMIT TO THE COMMISSION AN APPLICATION TO
 CEASE  PROVIDING  ANY PEG CHANNEL PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION THAT
 IS NOT UTILIZED BY THE MUNICIPALITY FOR AT LEAST EIGHT  HOURS  PER  DAY,
 AND  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, THE CHANNEL MAY THEREAFTER BE PROGRAMMED
 AT THE FRANCHISE HOLDER'S DISCRETION. THE COMMISSION MAY HOLD A  HEARING
 IN  THE  MUNICIPALITY  TO  AID  IN  MAKING  ITS DETERMINATION WHETHER TO
 APPROVE THE APPLICATION. THE COMMISSION SHALL ISSUE  A  DECISION  WITHIN
 THIRTY  BUSINESS  DAYS  OF  THE FRANCHISEE'S APPLICATION. IF THE MUNICI-
 PALITY SUBSEQUENTLY CERTIFIES TO THE COMMISSION AND  HOLDER  A  SCHEDULE
 A. 3682  28
 
 FOR AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS OF DAILY NON-REPEAT PEG CHANNEL PROGRAMMING PER
 CHANNEL,  THE  HOLDER  SHALL RESTORE THE PEG CHANNEL OR CHANNELS FOR THE
 USE OF THE MUNICIPALITY FOR AS LONG AS THE MUNICIPALITY USES THE CHANNEL
 OR CHANNELS FOR AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS A DAY.
  4. THE CONTENT AND OPERATION OF ANY PEG ACCESS CHANNEL PROVIDED PURSU-
 ANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MUNICIPALITY,
 RECEIVING THE BENEFIT OF SUCH CHANNEL, AND THE  FRANCHISE  HOLDER  BEARS
 ONLY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF SUCH CHANNEL, SUBJECT TO
 REASONABLE  TECHNOLOGICAL  CONSTRAINTS.  THE  FRANCHISE  HOLDER SHALL BE
 RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE CONNECTIVITY, AS WELL AS  OTHER  EQUIPMENT
 NECESSARY,  TO EACH PEG ACCESS CHANNEL PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTION LOCATION
 AND FOR DOING SO WITHOUT CHARGE FOR UP TO THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED FEET  OF
 THE HOLDER'S CONNECTING FACILITIES.
  5.  THE  MUNICIPALITY,  OR  ITS DESIGNEES, MUST ENSURE THAT ALL TRANS-
 MISSIONS, CONTENT, OR PROGRAMMING TO BE TRANSMITTED OVER  A  PEG  ACCESS
 CHANNEL  OR  FACILITY BY A FRANCHISE HOLDER ARE PROVIDED OR SUBMITTED TO
 THE CABLE OPERATOR IN A MANNER OR FORM THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ACCEPTED
 AND TRANSMITTED BY THE CABLE OPERATOR,  WITHOUT  REQUIREMENT  FOR  ADDI-
 TIONAL  ALTERATION  OR CHANGE IN THE CONTENT BY THE CABLE OPERATOR, OVER
 THE CABLE SYSTEM OF THE  CABLE  OPERATOR.  THE  MUNICIPALITY'S,  OR  ITS
 DESIGNEES'  PROVISION  OF  PEG  CONTENT  TO  THE HOLDER SHALL CONSTITUTE
 AUTHORIZATION FOR THE HOLDER TO CARRY SUCH  CONTENT  INCLUDING,  AT  THE
 HOLDER'S  OPTION,  BEYOND  THE  JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES OF THE MUNICI-
 PALITY.
  6. THE FRANCHISE HOLDER AND AN  INCUMBENT  CABLE  OPERATOR  SHALL  USE
 REASONABLE  EFFORTS  TO INTERCONNECT THEIR CABLE SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSE
 OF PROVIDING PEG PROGRAMMING. INTERCONNECTION  MAY  BE  ACCOMPLISHED  BY
 DIRECT  CABLE,  MICROWAVE LINK, SATELLITE, OR OTHER REASONABLE METHOD OF
 CONNECTION. FRANCHISE HOLDERS AND INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATORS SHALL  NEGO-
 TIATE  IN  GOOD  FAITH  AND  INCUMBENT  CABLE OPERATORS MAY NOT WITHHOLD
 INTERCONNECTION OF PEG CHANNELS. IN THE EVENT A FRANCHISE HOLDER AND  AN
 INCUMBENT  CABLE  OPERATOR  CANNOT REACH A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE INTERCON-
 NECTION AGREEMENT, THEN THE DUTY OF THE HOLDER SHALL  BE  DISCHARGED  IF
 THE  HOLDER MAKES INTERCONNECTION AVAILABLE TO THE CHANNEL ORIGINATOR AT
 A POINT ON THE HOLDER'S NETWORK DETERMINED BY THE HOLDER.
  7. THE PEG CHANNELS SHALL BE FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE LOCAL ENTITY
 OR ITS DESIGNEE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND  GOVERNMENTAL  CHAN-
 NELS.  THE PEG CHANNELS SHALL BE USED ONLY FOR NONCOMMERCIAL PURPOSES.
 HOWEVER, ADVERTISING, UNDERWRITING, OR SPONSORSHIP  RECOGNITION  MAY  BE
 CARRIED  ON  THE  CHANNELS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FUNDING PEG-RELATED ACTIV-
 ITIES. THE PEG CHANNELS SHALL ALL BE CARRIED ON THE BASIC SERVICE  TIER.
 TO  THE  EXTENT FEASIBLE, THE PEG CHANNELS SHALL NOT BE SEPARATED NUMER-
 ICALLY FROM OTHER CHANNELS CARRIED ON THE BASIC  SERVICE  TIER  AND  THE
 CHANNEL  NUMBERS  FOR THE PEG CHANNELS SHALL BE THE SAME CHANNEL NUMBERS
 USED BY THE INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATOR UNLESS PROHIBITED BY  FEDERAL  LAW.
 AFTER  THE  INITIAL  DESIGNATION  OF  PEG  CHANNEL  NUMBERS, THE CHANNEL
 NUMBERS SHALL NOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF THE  LOCAL  ENTITY
 UNLESS  THE  CHANGE  IS  REQUIRED  BY FEDERAL LAW. EACH CHANNEL SHALL BE
 CAPABLE OF CARRYING A NATIONAL TELEVISION SYSTEM COMMITTEE (NTSC)  TELE-
 VISION SIGNAL.
  8.  THE  CONTENT TO BE PROVIDED OVER THE PEG CHANNEL CAPACITY PROVIDED
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL ENTITY
 OR ITS DESIGNEE RECEIVING THE BENEFIT OF THAT CAPACITY, AND  THE  HOLDER
 OF  A STATE FRANCHISE BEARS ONLY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRANSMISSION
 OF THAT CONTENT, SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL RESTRAINTS.
 A. 3682  29
 
  9. THE PEG SIGNAL SHALL BE RECEIVABLE BY ALL SUBSCRIBERS, WHETHER THEY
 RECEIVE DIGITAL OR ANALOG SERVICE, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, WITHOUT THE
 NEED FOR ANY EQUIPMENT OTHER THAN THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO RECEIVE THE
 LOWEST COST TIER OF SERVICE. THE PEG ACCESS CAPACITY PROVIDED  SHALL  BE
 OF SIMILAR QUALITY AND FUNCTIONALITY TO THAT OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL CHAN-
 NELS ON THE LOWEST COST TIER OF SERVICE UNLESS THE SIGNAL IS PROVIDED TO
 THE HOLDER AT A LOWER QUALITY OR WITH LESS FUNCTIONALITY.
  10.  AFTER  JANUARY  FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE, AND UNTIL THE
 EXPIRATION OF THE INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATOR'S FRANCHISE, IF THE INCUMBENT
 CABLE OPERATOR HAS EXISTING UNSATISFIED OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE  FRANCHISE
 TO  REMIT  TO THE LOCAL ENTITY OR ITS DESIGNEE ANY CASH PAYMENTS FOR THE
 ONGOING COSTS OF PUBLIC,  EDUCATIONAL,  AND  GOVERNMENT  ACCESS  CHANNEL
 FACILITIES,  THE  LOCAL  ENTITY,  OR  ITS DESIGNEE FOR THE PUBLIC ACCESS
 CHANNELS, SHALL DIVIDE THOSE CASH PAYMENTS  AMONG  ALL  CABLE  OR  VIDEO
 PROVIDERS AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. THE FEE SHALL BE THE HOLDER'S PRO
 RATA PER SUBSCRIBER SHARE OF THE CASH PAYMENT REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY THE
 INCUMBENT  CABLE  OPERATOR TO THE LOCAL ENTITY OR ITS DESIGNEE COMMUNITY
 ACCESS ORGANIZATION FOR THE COSTS OF PEG CHANNEL FACILITIES.  ALL  VIDEO
 SERVICE  PROVIDERS  AND THE INCUMBENT CABLE OPERATOR SHALL BE SUBJECT TO
 THE SAME REQUIREMENTS FOR RECURRING PAYMENTS  FOR  THE  SUPPORT  OF  PEG
 CHANNEL  FACILITIES,  WHETHER EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS REVENUE
 OR AS AN AMOUNT PER SUBSCRIBER, PER MONTH, OR OTHERWISE.
  11. A LOCAL ENTITY SHALL ESTABLISH A PAYMENT FOR THE  ONGOING  SUPPORT
 OF  THE  COST OF PEG FACILITIES AND SERVICES THAT WOULD BECOME EFFECTIVE
 SUBSEQUENT TO THE  EXPIRATION  OF  ANY  FEE  IMPOSED  BY  THIS  ARTICLE,
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  NO  SUCH FEE SHALL BE ALLOCATED SUCH THAT ANY
 COMMUNITY ACCESS ORGANIZATION IS RECEIVING ANYTHING LESS THAN WHAT IT IS
 RECEIVING FROM THE CABLE OPERATOR ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE,
 AND PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT EVERY LOCAL ENTITY SHALL BE  ENTITLED  TO  A
 PAYMENT  OF  NOT  LESS THAN TWO PERCENT FROM THE HOLDER OF A STATE FRAN-
 CHISE FOR THE  ONGOING  SUPPORT  OF  THE  COST  OF  PEG  FACILITIES  AND
 SERVICES.  IF,  ON  DECEMBER  THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE, A
 LOCAL ENTITY OR ITS DESIGNEE WAS IMPOSING A SEPARATE FEE TO SUPPORT  PEG
 CHANNEL  FACILITIES THAT IS IN EXCESS OF TWO PERCENT, THAT ENTITY OR ITS
 DESIGNEE MAY ESTABLISH A FEE NO GREATER THAN THAT SEPARATE FEE,  AND  IN
 NO  EVENT  GREATER THAN THREE PERCENT, TO SUPPORT PEG ACTIVITIES. IF THE
 PEG SUPPORT FEE IMPOSED BY A LOCAL ENTITY OR ITS DESIGNEE  IS  EXPRESSED
 IN  A  MANNER  OTHER  THAN  AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS REVENUES, THE LOCAL
 ENTITY OR ITS DESIGNEE COMMUNITY ACCESS ORGANIZATION  MAY  CONVERT  THAT
 FEE  TO A CURRENTLY EQUIVALENT PERCENTAGE OF GROSS REVENUES AT ANY TIME.
 THE LOCAL  ENTITY  OR  ITS  DESIGNEE  MAY  ADOPT  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  THE
 PROVISION  OF  PEG-RELATED  IN-KIND  RESOURCES  BY  ALL  CABLE AND VIDEO
 SERVICE PROVIDERS.
  12. RULES AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMMUNITY ACCESS ORGANIZATION
 SHALL GOVERN THE USE OF ANY CHANNEL TIME ON THE PUBLIC CHANNELS AS  WELL
 AS  THE  EQUIPMENT,  FACILITIES AND SERVICES RELATED TO THE PUBLIC CHAN-
 NELS.
  13. THE COMMISSION, THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCEEDING  SHALL  HAVE
 THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE ANY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS SECTION
 TO  RESOLVE  ANY  DISPUTE  REGARDING  THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS
 SECTION. AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCESS  IS  EXHAUSTED,  A  COURT  OF
 COMPETENT  JURISDICTION  SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE ANY REQUIRE-
 MENT UNDER THIS SECTION OR RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE  REGARDING  THE  REQUIRE-
 MENTS  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS SECTION, AND NO CABLE OPERATOR MAY BE BARRED
 FROM THE PROVISION OF CABLE SERVICE OR BE REQUIRED  TO  TERMINATE  CABLE
 SERVICE AS A RESULT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR ENFORCEMENT ACTION.

 A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTIONS TWO
 HUNDRED  TWENTY-FOUR  AND  TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR-A OF THIS CHAPTER AND
 ANY OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS  PERTAINING  TO  THE  PROVISION  OF
 VIDEO  SERVICE  ESTABLISHED  BY  FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION OR ADOPTED BY
 SUBSEQUENT ENACTMENT  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE.  ALL  CUSTOMER  SERVICE  AND
 CONSUMER  PROTECTION  STANDARDS  UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE INTERPRETED
 AND APPLIED TO ACCOMMODATE NEWER OR DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WHILE MEETING
 OR EXCEEDING THE GOALS OF THESE STANDARDS.
  2. IN ADDITION, CABLE OPERATORS:
  (A) SHALL CLEARLY  AND  CONSPICUOUSLY  DISCLOSE  TO  USERS,  IN  PLAIN

 SURCHARGE ON THE BASIS OF THE CONTENT, APPLICATION, OR SERVICE;
  (C) INTERCONNECT THEIR FACILITIES WITH THE FACILITIES OF OTHER PROVID-
 ERS OF BROADBAND NETWORK SERVICES ON  REASONABLE  AND  NONDISCRIMINATORY

 OR INTERNET NETWORK PROVIDER FROM TAKING REASONABLE AND NONDISCRIMINATO-
 RY MEASURES:
  (A)  TO  MANAGE THE FUNCTIONING OF ITS NETWORK TO PROTECT THE SECURITY
 AND TO OFFER PARENTAL CONTROLS AND OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURES OF

 A. 3682  32
 
 ALL  HOUSEHOLDS  WITHIN  THE  DESIGNATED SERVICE AREA FOOTPRINT. A CABLE
 OPERATOR THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE UNDER THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL  NOT  DENY ACCESS TO CABLE SERVICE TO ANY GROUP OF POTENTIAL RESI-
 DENTIAL  SUBSCRIBERS  BECAUSE  OF THE INCOME OR RACE OF THE RESIDENTS IN
 THE LOCAL AREA IN WHICH SUCH GROUP RESIDES. A FRANCHISEE MUST SUBMIT  TO

 TO BE SERVED, THE DATE SERVICE SHALL  BEGIN  IN  EACH  PROPOSED  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  AND  A  DATE  CERTAIN  BY  WHICH EACH COMMUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO
 RECEIVE CABLE SERVICE. THE COMMISSION WILL  ENSURE  THAT  THE  BUILD-OUT
 PROCESS  IS  NOT  DISCRIMINATORY  BASED  ON  AN AREA'S CLASS OR RACE. IF
 DEPLOYMENT OF CABLE SERVICES UNDER A STATEWIDE  FRANCHISE  IS  SCHEDULED
 FOR DEPLOYMENT IN A GIVEN AREA, THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST OFFER SERVICE TO
 ALL RESIDENTS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR THE COMMISSION MAY TERMINATE
 THE  FRANCHISE  PURSUANT TO SECTION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX OF THIS ARTI-

 LISHED  BY  FEDERAL  LAW OR REGULATION OR BY SUBSEQUENT ENACTMENT OF THE
 LEGISLATURE. ALL CUSTOMER  SERVICE  AND  CONSUMER  PROTECTION  STANDARDS
 UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED TO ACCOMMODATE NEWER
 OR  DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WHILE MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE GOALS OF THESE
 STANDARDS.
  3. IF THE COMMISSION DETERMINES  THAT  A  CABLE  OPERATOR  HAS  DENIED
 ACCESS  OF CABLE SERVICE TO A GROUP OF POTENTIAL RESIDENTIAL SUBSCRIBERS
 BECAUSE OF THE INCOME LEVELS OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE LOCAL AREA IN WHICH
 SUCH GROUP RESIDES OR  HAS  FAILED  TO  MEET  THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THE
 SECTION,  THE  COMMISSION  IS  AUTHORIZED TO, AFTER CONDUCTING A HEARING
 WITH FULL NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, IMPOSE MONETARY  PENALTIES
 OF NOT LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, NOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOU-
 SAND  DOLLARS  PER  MUNICIPALITY, NOT TO EXCEED A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION
 SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR ALL VIOLATIONS. A  MUNI-
 CIPALITY  IN  WHICH THE PROVIDER OFFERS CABLE SERVICE SHALL BE AN APPRO-
 PRIATE PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING.
  § 246. ENFORCEMENT. THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ENFORCING THE  PROVISIONS
 OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  NOTWITHSTANDING  SPECIFIC  SECTIONS OF THIS ARTICLE,
 SHALL BE AN ACTION IN A  COURT  OF  COMPETENT  JURISDICTION  BROUGHT  BY
 EITHER  THE  MUNICIPALITY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF THE COMMIS-
 SION OR OTHER INJURED PARTY. AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS BEFORE BRINGING SUCH AN
 ACTION, THE MUNICIPALITY OR ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL SERVE  THE  FRANCHISE
 HOLDER  WITH A NOTICE SETTING OUT THE ALLEGED VIOLATION AND STATING THAT
 AN ACTION  MAY  BE  BROUGHT  UNLESS  THE  HOLDER  CORRECTS  THE  ALLEGED
 VIOLATION  OR  ENTERS  INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION
 WITHIN THE SIXTY-DAY NOTICE PERIOD. THE NOTICE SHALL  CONTAIN  A  SUFFI-
 CIENTLY  DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  ALLEGED VIOLATION TO ENABLE THE
 FRANCHISE HOLDER TO MAKE A SPECIFIC RESPONSE.
  § 6. Section 215 of the public service law is amended by adding a  new
 subdivision 14 to read as follows:
  14.  REQUIRE THAT CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISES CONTAIN, UPON SUBMISSION
 FOR  CERTIFICATES  OF  CONFIRMATION, PROVISIONS REQUIRING THAT THE CABLE
 TELEVISION SERVICES FRANCHISEE DELIVER TO THE FRANCHISOR AND THE COMMIS-
 SION, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, A WRITTEN REPORT DESCRIBING EVERY INSTANCE  IN

 FRANCHISOR  TO ASCERTAIN THE NATURE OF ANY BLOCKING, LIMITATION OR OTHER
 RESTRICTIONS, AND THE REASON FOR THE FRANCHISEE FOR TAKING SUCH  ACTION,
 BUT  SHALL  BE  PROVIDED  IN  A  MANNER REASONABLY CALCULATED TO PROTECT
 SUBSCRIBER PRIVACY OR THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT.  NOTHING
 IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO RESTRICT THE RIGHTS OF FRAN-

 NORMAL OPERATION OF BROADBAND NETWORKS, AND OTHER SIMILAR TYPES OR FORMS
 OF  MATERIAL  OR  SOFTWARE (THE FOREGOING EXAMPLES ARE ILLUSTRATIVE, NOT
 EXHAUSTIVE OF SUCH THREATS TO USERS  AND/OR  THE  NETWORK,  COLLECTIVELY
 HEREAFTER  "NETWORK  THREATS").  BLOCKING  OR  LIMITATION  OF SUBSCRIBER
 ACCESS TO THE MAXIMALLY DIVERSE INTERNET, IF  NOT  PREDICATED  UPON  THE
 FRANCHISEE'S  RIGHT  TO  DEFEND  ITS  NETWORK  AND  SUBSCRIBERS  AGAINST
 "NETWORK THREATS", SHALL PRESUMPTIVELY BE A BREACH OF THE FRANCHISE.  NO
 FRANCHISEE  SHALL  BE  RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY EFFORTS BY OR POLI-
 CIES, PRACTICES OR  PROCEDURES  OF  AN  UNAFFILIATED  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICES  PROVIDER  OR  INTERNET  SERVICES PROVIDER OR INTERNET PROTOCOL

 TORY  TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  BY  WHICH THE TELEPHONE COMPANY, BROADBAND

 TO  THE  PROPERTY'S  TENANTS.  THE COMMISSION SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO
 IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION BY  APPROPRIATE  RULES  AND
 REGULATIONS  AND  TO  ADMINISTRATIVELY ADJUDICATE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER
 THIS SUBDIVISION. IN NO EVENT MAY THE LACK OF AGREEMENT OVER  TERMS  AND
 CONDITIONS  OF  ACCESS  DELAY  THE  ABILITY OF A REQUESTING TELECOMMUNI-
 CATIONS COMPANY TO OBTAIN ACCESS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS FOLLOWING  AN
 INITIAL REQUEST THEREFOR.
  § 8. Subdivision 2 of section 99 of the public service law, as amended
 by chapter 383 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  (A) No franchise nor any right to or under any franchise to own or

 hundred million dollars, (b)  less  than  twenty-five  thousand  dollars

 effective  without  the  commission's written consent within ninety days
 after such corporation notifies the commission that it plans to complete
 such transfer or lease and submits a  description  of  the  transfer  or
 lease,  unless  the  commission, or its designee, determines within such
 ninety days that the public interest requires  the  commission's  review
 and written consent.]
  (C) (1) NO CONSENT SHALL BE GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION TO THE ASSIGNMENT,
 TRANSFER, OR LEASE OF ANY RIGHT OR FRANCHISE TO OPERATE A TELEGRAPH LINE
 OR  TELEPHONE LINE UNLESS IT SHALL HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT SUCH ASSIGNMENT,

 SECTION, A DIVESTITURE ENTITY  IS  A  BUSINESS  ENTITY  CREATED  BY  THE
 ASSIGNMENT,  EXCHANGE,  SALE,  OR  OTHER  TRANSFER  OF SOME OR ALL OF AN
 EXISTING TELEPHONE CORPORATION'S LINES, SYSTEM, OR WORKS TO A NEW  TELE-
 PHONE CORPORATION.

 THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  REQUEST  AN  ADVISORY  OPINION FROM THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT COMPETITION WILL BE ADVERSELY  AFFECTED
 AND  WHAT MITIGATORY MEASURES COULD BE ADOPTED TO AVOID ANY SUCH ADVERSE
 EFFECT.

 MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROPOSAL RECOMMENDED BY OTHER PARTIES, INCLUDING NO
 MERGER, ACQUISITION, OR CONTROL, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT  COMPARABLE
 SHORT-TERM  AND LONG-TERM ECONOMIC SAVINGS CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH OTHER

 GENERAL REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT COMPETITION WILL BE ADVERSELY  AFFECTED

 public  interest  requires  the  commission's  review  and  its  written
 consent.  Nothing [herein] contained IN THIS SECTION shall be construed
 to prevent the holding of any stock heretofore lawfully acquired, nor to
 prevent, upon the surrender or exchange of  such  stock  pursuant  to  a

 any stock by or through any person or corporation  to  any  corporation,
 company,  association,  partnership  or  person,  in  violation  of  any

  §  12.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section 90-a
 to read as follows:
  § 90-A. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 1. THE STATE OF NEW YORK'S  LONG-STANDING
 POLICY,  CODIFIED IN THIS SECTION, IS THAT CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS TOOLS,
 AND PARTICULARLY TELEPHONE SERVICES, I.E.  ESSENTIAL  SERVICES,  ARE  SO
 FUNDAMENTAL  THAT  IT  IS  NOT  IN  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST TO LEAVE THEIR
 PROVISION TO THE VAGARIES OF THE  MARKETPLACE  ALONE.  FURTHERMORE,  THE
 LEGISLATURE  DECLARES THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT SUCH ESSEN-
 TIAL SERVICES BE MADE AND MAINTAINED UNIVERSALLY ACROSS NEW  YORK.  SUCH
 TOOLS  AND  SERVICES HAVE, OVER TIME, AND INCREASINGLY NOW, SHAPED CITI-
 ZENS' ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE  IN  CIVIC  AFFAIRS,  TO  ACQUIRE  LEARNING
 SKILLS  NEEDED  FOR THEIR ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND THAT OF THE STATE, AND TO
 ENJOY THE RICH AND UNPARALLELED SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE THAT IS A VITAL
 PART OF NEW YORK  STATE'S  ECONOMY.  THE  STATE'S  GOALS  FOR  UNIVERSAL
 SERVICE  ARE TO FURTHER AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST BY PROMOTING THE
 A. 3682  41
 
 AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY SERVICES AT  JUST,  REASONABLE,  AND  AFFORDABLE
 RATES;  TO  ADVANCE  THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH SERVICES TO ALL CONSUMERS,
 INCLUDING THOSE IN LOW INCOME, RURAL, INSULAR, AND HIGH  COST  AREAS  AT
 RATES  THAT  ARE  REASONABLY COMPARABLE TO THOSE CHARGED IN HIGH-DENSITY
 URBAN AREAS; AND TO INCREASE ACCESS TO, AND THE  UBIQUITY  OF,  ADVANCED
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN AN EQUITABLE AND
 NONDISCRIMINATORY MANNER. ALL TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS AND  PROVIDERS  AND
 RESELLERS  OF  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES  SHOULD  CONTRIBUTE  TO CORE
 PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC INTEREST GOALS TO THE EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY  LAW.
 AT  A  MINIMUM,  THESE  INCLUDE  EQUIVALENT  UNIVERSAL  SERVICE SUPPORT,
 PROVISION AND SUPPORT FOR E911, DISABILITY ACCESS, CONSUMER PROTECTIONS,
 AND EQUITABLE TAXATION. EFFECTIVE PUBLIC PROGRAMS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE
 WHERE COMPETITIVE FORCES DO NOT RESULT IN THE  DEPLOYMENT,  MAINTENANCE,
 OR  RECONSTRUCTION  OF  AFFORDABLE,  HIGH-QUALITY,  AND RELIABLE ADVANCE
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIC  REGIONS  AND  DEMO-
 GRAPHIC  SEGMENTS  OF  THE  STATE.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  NETWORKS MUST BE
 INTER-OPERABLE, BASED ON OPEN STANDARDS, RELIABLE, SURVIVABLE, DIVERSELY
 PATHED, AS WIDELY INTERCONNECTED AS IS REASONABLE,  ACCESSIBLE  FOR  ALL
 USERS AS PROVIDED FOR BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE AMERICANS
 WITH  DISABILITIES  ACT,  AND  ALL  APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL
 REGULATIONS, AND MUST MEET BASIC REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING PUBLIC  SAFETY,
 CONSUMER PROTECTION, AND RELEVANT SOCIAL AND MORAL OBLIGATIONS.
  2. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION:
  (A)  THE  TERM  "UNIVERSAL SERVICE" MEANS THAT CERTAIN BASIC TELEPHONE
 FACILITIES,  SERVICES,  AND  INSTRUMENTALITIES,  KNOWN  AS  "ESSENTIAL
 SERVICES",  SHALL  BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANY PERSON, CORPORATION, OR LOCALITY
 IN NEW YORK STATE AT COSTS REASONABLY COMPARABLE  TO  RATES  CHARGED  IN
 URBAN  AREAS AND LOW-COST AREAS, SO THAT THERE SHALL NOT BE ANY UNDUE OR
 UNREASONABLE PREFERENCE OR ADVANTAGE  TO  ANY  PERSON,  CORPORATION,  OR
 LOCALITY.
  (B)  THE  TERM  "ESSENTIAL  SERVICES" MEANS THE PROVISION BY TELEPHONE
 CORPORATIONS OF VOICE GRADE ACCESS TO AND  ACROSS  THE  PUBLIC  SWITCHED
 TELEPHONE  NETWORK,  WITH THE ABILITY TO PLACE AND RECEIVE CALLS; TOUCH-
 TONE  SERVICE;  SINGLE-PARTY  SERVICE;  ACCESS  TO  EMERGENCY  SERVICES,
 INCLUDING 911 AND E911 (WHICH IDENTIFIES A CALLER'S LOCATION); ACCESS TO
 OPERATOR SERVICES; ACCESS TO INTER-EXCHANGE SERVICES; ACCESS TO DIRECTO-
 RY  ASSISTANCE;  ACCESS TO "LIFELINE" SERVICES, OR OTHER SERVICES EQUIV-
 ALENT IN PRICE AND QUALITY  FOR  QUALIFYING  LOW-INCOME  CONSUMERS;  AND
 ACCESS  TO  ALL  OF  SUCH  OTHER SERVICES AS MAY BE MANDATED BY FEDERAL,
 STATE, AND LOCAL LAW.
  3. WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMMISSION  HAD  ACTUAL
 KNOWLEDGE,  OR  SHOULD  REASONABLY  HAVE  KNOWN OR BEEN INFORMED, OF THE
 OCCURRENCE, OR APPEARANCE OF THE PROXIMATE OCCURRENCE,  OF  A  PURCHASE,
 ACQUISITION,  TAKING,  OR  OTHER TRANSFER OF CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP OF THE
 CAPITAL STOCK OF A  TELEGRAPH  OR  TELEPHONE  CORPORATION  ORGANIZED  OR
 EXISTING  UNDER  THE  LAWS  OF  THIS  STATE  WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF
 SECTION ONE HUNDRED OF THIS ARTICLE OR PARAGRAPH (B)  OF  THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION,  THE  COMMISSION SHALL COMPILE AND PUBLISH A REPORT ON THE EFFECT,
 IF ANY, OF SUCH TRANSFER OF CONTROL UPON UNIVERSAL SERVICE IN THE STATE.
 SUCH REPORT SHALL BE KNOWN AS THE "UNIVERSAL SERVICE  IMPACT  ANALYSIS",
 AND  SHALL BE ISSUED BEFORE THE COMMISSION MAY VOTE UPON THE APPROVAL OF
 SUCH OCCURRENCE. IF, ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THERE IS
 A PROCEEDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF  SUBDIVI-
 SION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION, THEN THE COMMISSION SHALL HAVE THIRTY DAYS
 FROM SUCH EFFECTIVE DATE TO ISSUE ITS UNIVERSAL SERVICE IMPACT  ANALYSIS
 A. 3682  42
 
 REPORT. SUCH UNIVERSAL SERVICE IMPACT ANALYSIS REPORT SHALL INCLUDE, BUT
 NOT BE LIMITED TO:
  (A)  AN  ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS UPON PRICING OF TELEPHONE SERVICES IN
 HIGH-COST AND RURAL AND LOW-INCOME AREAS AFFECTED BY  SUCH  TRANSFER  OF
 CONTROL;
  (B) AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF SUCH TRANSFER OF
 CONTROL  UPON  NETWORK  RELIABILITY  AND  SERVICE  QUALITY  IN  THE AREA
 AFFECTED BY SUCH TRANSFER OF CONTROL;
  (C) AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL EFFECTS  UPON  NEW  SERVICE
 PROVISION  IN  RURAL  AND HIGH-COST AND LOW-INCOME AREAS WITHIN THE AREA
 AFFECTED BY SUCH TRANSFER OF CONTROL.
  FOR THE PURPOSES OF  TRIGGERING  SUCH  REPORTING  REQUIREMENT  BY  THE
 COMMISSION,  THERE  SHALL  BE  A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF A TRANSFER OF
 CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP UPON THE ACQUISITION OR ACCUMULATION BY ANY  PERSON
 OR  GROUP  OF  PERSONS  OF  TEN  PERCENT OR MORE OF THE SHARES OF, OR OF
 COMPARABLE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, A TELEGRAPH OR TELEPHONE  CORPORATION.
 SUCH  TRANSFER  OF  CONTROL  OR ACQUISITION OR ACCUMULATION OF OWNERSHIP
 INTERESTS SHALL ALSO BE DEEMED  TO  OCCUR  UPON  THE  SALE,  ASSIGNMENT,
 TRANSFER,  DIVESTITURE OF A PORTION OF A BUSINESS ENTITY, LEASE OR OTHER
 DISPOSAL, EITHER IN WHOLE OR PART, EITHER  BY  INVOLUNTARY  SALE  OR  BY
 VOLUNTARY SALE, MERGER, OR CONSOLIDATION, OR BANKRUPTCY, OF ANY TITLE TO
 SUCH  TELEGRAPH  OR TELEPHONE CORPORATION, EITHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE, OR
 OF THE LINES OR OTHER NETWORK ELEMENTS OF SUCH  TELEGRAPH  OR  TELEPHONE
 CORPORATION  WITHIN  THREE  OR  MORE  LOCAL  ACCESS  AND TRANSPORT AREAS
 (LATAS) OR COUNTIES.
  4. UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE REPORT UNDER SUBDIVISION THREE  OF  THIS
 SECTION  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  HAVE POWER AND THE DUTY TO ESTABLISH BY
 RULE OR REGULATION, WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  SUCH  CHARGES,  EXCHANGES  OF  FUNDS, FEES, METHODOLOGIES, AND
 MODALITIES AS ARE NECESSARY AND CONVENIENT TO  PROMOTE  AND  ENSURE  THE
 STATEWIDE  UNIVERSAL  AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY ESSENTIAL SERVICES AT
 JUST, REASONABLE, AND AFFORDABLE RATES; TO ADVANCE THE  AVAILABILITY  OF
 SUCH  SERVICES  TO  ALL CONSUMERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN LOW INCOME, RURAL,
 INSULAR, AND HIGH COST AREAS AT RATES THAT ARE REASONABLY COMPARABLE  TO
 THOSE  CHARGED  IN  LOW COST AND URBAN AREAS; AND TO INCREASE ACCESS TO,
 AND THE UBIQUITY OF, ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  AVAILABLE  TO
 THE  PUBLIC IN AN EQUITABLE AND NONDISCRIMINATORY MANNER. THE COMMISSION
 SHALL HAVE POWER AND THE DUTY TO PROMULGATE SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AS
 ARE NECESSARY AND CONVENIENT TO EFFECTUATE THE STATE POLICIES SET  FORTH
 IN THIS SECTION.
  §  13.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section 90-b
 to read as follows:
  § 90-B.  REPORTS, HEARINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS STUDYING MATTERS IN  THE
 PUBLIC INTEREST. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO AFFORDA-
 BLE  TELEPHONE  SERVICE HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING TRADITION AND POLICY OF
 THE STATE. HOWEVER, THIS POLICY HAS COME INTO QUESTION WITH PROPOSALS BY
 INCUMBENT CARRIERS TO SELL SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE UPSTATE TELEPHONE
 NETWORK TO COMPANIES WITH LITTLE OR NO BACKGROUND IN  THE  PROVISION  OF
 TELEPHONE  SERVICE.  UNIVERSAL SERVICE, LONG TAKEN FOR GRANTED, MUST NOW
 BE REEVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT ANY FUTURE UPSTATE TELEPHONE CARRIERS WILL
 MAINTAIN THIS  POLICY.  THEREFORE,  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  PREPARE  AND
 SUBMIT, ON OR BEFORE AUGUST FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, A REPORT TO
 THE  GOVERNOR,  TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, SPEAKER OF THE ASSEM-
 BLY, MINORITY LEADERS OF THE SENATE  AND  ASSEMBLY,  CHAIR  AND  RANKING
 MINORITY  MEMBER  OF THE SENATE ENERGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE,
 AND THE CHAIR AND RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY  CORPORATIONS,
 A. 3682  43
 
 AUTHORITIES  AND  COMMISSIONS  COMMITTEE.  THE REPORT SHALL EVALUATE THE
 IMPLICATIONS OF A SALE OF A PORTION OF THE UPSTATE TELEPHONE NETWORK FOR
 THE POLICY OF UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SERVICE. THE  REPORT  SHALL
 FURTHER  EVALUATE  THE  STANDARDS BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT WILL ANALYZE A
 PROPOSED SALE.
  § 14. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  90-c
 to read as follows:
  §  90-C. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. 1. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT DEPLOYING
 BROADBAND NETWORKS AND ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  THROUGHOUT  NEW
 YORK  WILL  ENABLE  CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTHCARE, PUBLIC SAFETY,
 EDUCATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND  THE  CREATION  OF  JOBS,  AND  WILL
 FACILITATE  THE  FREE  EXCHANGE OF IDEAS THAT IS VITAL TO DEMOCRACY. THE
 LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL SERVICES  COMMUNITY,
 PUBLISHING COMMUNITY, HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY, HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMMU-
 NITY  AND OTHER WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS COMMUNITIES HAVE PLACED NEW YORK AT
 THE FOREFRONT OF NUMEROUS VITAL INDUSTRIES, BUT THAT TO CONTINUE TO BE A
 WORLD-CLASS LEADER, NEW YORK MUST  ADOPT  POLICIES  AND  PRACTICES  THAT
 PROMOTE  THE ROLL-OUT AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BROADBAND. FINALLY, THE
 LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT RURAL AREAS OF NEW YORK LACK THE  MULTIPLE  TELE-
 COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS NECESSARY TO LINK TO OUTSIDE RESOURCES DURING
 TIMES  OF  EMERGENCY, THAT BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE NECESSARY TO CREATE OR
 FACILITATE SUSTAINABLE TELEMEDICINE NETWORKS THAT CONNECT  RURAL  HEALTH
 CLINICS  TO  URBAN MEDICAL CENTERS, AND THAT INCREASED GOVERNMENT USE OF
 BROADBAND NETWORKS AND ADVANCED  COMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES  WILL  ENHANCE
 GOVERNMENT  OPERATIONS  THROUGH  TELEMEDICINE  FOR  HEALTHCARE, DISTANCE
 LEARNING FOR EDUCATION, REDUNDANT  AND  DIVERSELY-PATHED  COMMUNICATIONS
 NETWORKS  FOR  PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS AND TO GENERALLY PROTECT THE
 HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS.

 SIONS  COMMITTEE.  THE  REPORT  SHALL  STUDY IN DETAIL THE ACTUAL RETAIL
 AVAILABILITY OF WIRELINE, WIRELESS CELLULAR AND FIXED-WIRELESS BROADBAND
 COMMUNICATIONS MODALITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND SHALL ORGAN-
 IZE THE DATA OF SUCH AVAILABILITY BY CENSUS TRACT.

 CORPORATION,  SHALL PREPARE AND SUBMIT, WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE EFFEC-
 TIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR, TEMPORARY PRESIDENT
 OF THE SENATE, SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, MINORITY LEADERS OF  THE  SENATE

 TRACT,  THAT  DO  NOT  HAVE GENERALLY AND READILY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE
 RETAIL ACCESS TO BROADBAND  WIRELINE  FACILITIES  AND/OR  FIXED-WIRELESS
 BROADBAND FACILITIES ("UNSERVED AREAS"); THE REPORT SHALL ALSO DETERMINE

 TELECOMMUNICATIONS  OR  ADVANCED  COMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES  PROVIDERS
 ("UNDERSERVED  AREAS");  THE REPORT SHALL ALSO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF
 ALL AREAS OF THE STATE, BY CENSUS TRACT,  THAT  QUALIFY  AS  "DISTRESSED
 AREAS"  UNDER  THIS  CHAPTER, AND EITHER DO OR DO NOT HAVE GENERALLY AND
 READILY COMMERCIALLY  AVAILABLE  RETAIL  ACCESS  TO  BROADBAND  WIRELINE
 FACILITIES AND/OR FIXED-WIRELESS BROADBAND FACILITIES; THE REPORT SHALL,
 FURTHERMORE,  ASSESS  AND SET FORTH WITH SPECIFICITY THE AGGREGATE UNMET
 DEMAND FOR BROADBAND SERVICES IN UNSERVED,  UNDERSERVED  AND  DISTRESSED

 ADMINISTRATIVE CHARACTERISTIC, AND SHALL ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT  OF  BROAD-
 BAND  CONNECTIVITY  THAT WOULD NEED TO BE BUILT OR OFFERED IN SUCH AREAS
 TO MEET THE UNMET DEMAND.  SUCH  REPORT  SHALL,  IN  ADDITION  TO  BEING
 SUBMITTED  TO  THE  GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND OFFICIALS SET FORTH ABOVE, BE
 USED TO CREATE A MAP IN STANDARD FORMAT TO BE DETERMINED BY THE NEW YORK
 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS CLEARINGHOUSE AND CSCIC,  AND  CONSISTENT
 WITH  THE  LEGITIMATE  SECURITY CONCERNS THAT MAY BE EXPRESSED BY CSCIC,
 SUCH MAP SHALL BE A FULLY THREE-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION OF ALL BROAD-
 BAND RESOURCES WITHIN THE STATE.
  § 15. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  90-d
 to read as follows:
  § 90-D. LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE. 1. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT:
  (A)  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST IS FURTHERED AND PROTECTED BY ENSURING THAT
 NEW YORK'S EXISTING ENHANCED 9-1-1 ("E911") SYSTEM  FOR  WIRELINE  TELE-
 PHONE  SERVICE  AND  WIRELESS CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDE ALL THE
 AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION ("ANI") AND AUTOMATIC LOCATION IDENTIFI-
 CATION ("ALI") NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND RESPOND  TO  HOME-
 LAND  SECURITY  CONCERNS,  AND  PARTICULARLY SO IN RURAL AREAS AND ON OR
 NEAR NEW YORK'S COASTLINES;
  (B) EXISTING EMERGENCY SERVICES SYSTEMS CAN ISOLATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE
 AGENCIES THAT NEED INTER-CONNECTIVITY IN MEETING HOMELAND  SECURITY  AND
 PUBLIC SAFETY CRISES;
  (C)  ALL  9-1-1  CALLERS  IN  NEW  YORK,  AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO
 RECEIVE AND ACT UPON SUCH CALLS, WOULD BE BETTER  ABLE  TO  ENHANCE  THE
 PUBLIC  SAFETY  WITH FLEXIBLE E911 NETWORKS THAT COULD BE INTERCONNECTED
 WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL INTERNET PROTOCOL BASED NETWORKS,  AND
 THAT  COULD  BE  FLEXIBLY  ADAPTED AND SCALED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES NEW
 COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY PLACE UPON E911 NETWORKS; AND
  (D) CLEAR LINES OF AUTHORITY AND ORGANIZATION IN  THE  DEPLOYMENT  AND
 ADMINISTRATION  OF  PUBLIC  SAFETY  ANSWERING POINTS SHOULD BE A GOAL OF
 STATE E911 POLICY.
  2. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PREPARE AND SUBMIT, WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF  THE

 AND TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN THE STATE
 PROVIDE  HIGH  QUALITY  CUSTOMER  SERVICE  AND  HIGH  QUALITY  TECHNICAL
 SERVICE.  ALL  NEW  YORK RESIDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT TO RECEIVE A
 SIMILAR LEVEL OF HIGH QUALITY SERVICE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY  LIVE  OR
 WHO  PROVIDES THEIR SERVICE. THE COMMISSION MUST MAKE USE OF ITS MAXIMUM
 AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE  BY  ENSURING
 THAT  TELEPHONE  SERVICE  QUALITY DOES NOT ERODE TO THE POINT THAT E-911
 SERVICE IS ENDANGERED BY PERSISTENT, EXTENDED, OR  CHRONIC  LOSS OF DIAL
 TONE, OR  BY  THE  FAILURE  OF  INTERMODAL  CARRIERS  TO  PROVIDE  E-911
 SERVICES, OR BY SUCH OTHER EROSION OF SERVICE QUALITY THAT WOULD TEND TO
 UNDERMINE  THE  ABILITY OF THE VARIOUS CITIZENS OF NEW YORK TO ENGAGE IN
 PROTECTED SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE NETWORKS AND  LINES  AND  FACILITIES
 AND EQUIPMENT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMISSION.
  2.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  COMMENCE A STUDY TO SURVEY SERVICE QUALITY
 PRACTICES AND STANDARDS OF PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES THAT
 WILL  LEAD  TO  LEGISLATIVE  AND  REGULATORY  RECOMMENDATIONS.  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  "TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICE  PROVIDER" OR
 "PROVIDER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES" SHALL MEAN A TELEPHONE  CORPO-
 RATION,  OR OTHER PROVIDER OF TELEPHONE SERVICES, CERTIFIED IN THE STATE
 WITH THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE INTRASTATE TOLL AND LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICE
 USING EITHER ITS OWN OR LEASED FACILITIES. THE COMMISSION SHALL ALSO, AS
 PART OF SUCH STUDY, DETERMINE WHAT RULES AND REGULATIONS SHALL BE NECES-
 SARY:
  (A) TO ENHANCE CONSUMER  PROTECTIONS  CURRENTLY  OFFERED  TO  WIRELINE
 TELEPHONE SERVICES CONSUMERS;
  (B)  TO  ESTABLISH AND SAFEGUARD WIRELINE TELEPHONE SERVICE QUALITY SO
 THAT IT IS REASONABLY COMPARABLE TO THE WIRELINE SERVICE QUALITY  NECES-
 SARY TO SAFEGUARD CITIZEN ACCESS TO E911; AND
  (C)  TO  PROTECT  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST,  PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH AND
 WELFARE.
  3. THE COMMISSION SHALL SPECIFICALLY  STUDY  SERVICE  AND  RELIABILITY
 ISSUES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AREAS OF THE STATE THAT EXPERIENCE
 CHRONIC  TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDERS OF TELE-
 COMMUNICATION  SERVICES,  INSTALLATION  OF  TELECOMMUNICATION  SERVICES
 ISSUES,  NETWORK PERFORMANCE, DATA COLLECTION BY PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMU-
 NICATIONS SERVICES, THE PREVIOUS EFFECT OF  PERFORMANCE-BASED  INCENTIVE
 PLANS  UPON  SERVICE QUALITY PROVIDED BY WIRELINE PROVIDERS, WHETHER AND
 HOW THE COMMISSION'S PRE-TWO THOUSAND ONE SERVICE QUALITY  AND  CONSUMER
 PROTECTION  RULES AND REGULATIONS CAN BE EXPANDED TO BE EQUALLY APPLICA-
 A. 3682  48
 
 BLE TO ALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE  E911  AND  IN  ANY
 MARKETING  MATERIALS  PRESENT  THEIR COMPANY OR PRODUCT AS A REPLACEMENT
 FOR PRIMARY LINE TELEPHONE SERVICE USED BY CONSUMERS IN  NEW  YORK,  AND
 ISSUES  CONCERNING  REPORTING  UPON  SERVICE  QUALITY AND OTHER CONSUMER
 PROTECTION RELATED ISSUES, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT SUCH REPORTING REQUIRE-
 MENTS SHALL BE  EXAMINED  BY  THE  COMMISSION  FOR  METHODS  THAT  MIGHT
 DECREASE THE COST OF COMPLIANCE BY SUCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS.
  4.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  ISSUE  A  REPORT OF ITS FINDINGS INCLUDING
 LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS  TO  ENHANCE  RELIABILITY  OF
 PROVIDERS  OF  TELEPHONE SERVICE TO THE GOVERNOR, TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF
 THE SENATE, SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, CHAIR OF THE  SENATE  COMMITTEE  ON
 ENERGY  AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  AND  CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON
 CORPORATIONS, AUTHORITIES AND COMMISSIONS WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS
 OF COMMENCING THE STUDY.
  5. THE COMMISSION SHALL, AT THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY AND SIMULTANE-
 OUSLY WITH THE DELIVERY OF THE REPORT, BEGIN A RULEMAKING PROCEEDING  TO
 IMPLEMENT  SUCH RULES AS MAY BE DETERMINED DURING THE STUDY TO BE NECES-
 SARY AND CONVENIENT TO EFFECTUATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF
 THIS SECTION.
  § 18. Applicability of other laws. The provisions of section seven  of
 this  act  are  intended to be consistent with the Federal Cable Act, 47
 U.S.C.  §521, et. seq., and nothing in this act shall be interpreted  to
 prevent  a  voice  provider, cable operator or municipality from seeking
 clarification of its rights and obligations under federal  law.  In  the
 event  that any cable operator obtains relief through judicial, adminis-
 trative, or executive action from any obligation imposed under this act,
 or from any obligation in a franchise agreement that gives  rise  to  an
 obligation  of  another  cable  operator under this act, all other cable
 operators shall be deemed to be relieved of their obligations under this
 act within the same geographic area and to the same extent.
  § 19. Severability. If any provision of this act or its application to
 any person or circumstance is held invalid,  this  invalidity  does  not
 affect  other  provisions  or applications of this act that can be given
 effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the
 provisions of this act are declared to be severable.
  § 20. This act shall take effect immediately.
