  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Mental Health Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
events designed to raise awareness of serious health issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Mental  Health  Awareness
Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mental Health Month (MHM) began in 1949, to raise awareness
of mental health conditions and mental wellness for all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mental  illness is common, yet many never get help; 1 in 5
U.S. adults experience mental illness each year, yet only 43 percent  of
people  with  a mental illness receive treatment; furthermore, for those
who ultimately do get help, the average delay in getting treatment is 11
years from the first onset of symptoms; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first signs and symptoms  of  mental  health  problems,
some  of  which  develop  to  the  point  of becoming diagnosable mental
illness begin on average, at about 14 years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS, Untreated mental illness has serious consequences; this  is
a  serious  problem  because  unrecognized,  untreated  and late treated
mental illness elevates the risk of mental health crises such as suicide
and self-injury, diminishes prospects for recovery  and  contributes  to
substance abuse and other damaging negative coping behaviors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Suicide  is  the  second  leading  cause of death for ages
10-34, and the overall suicide rate in the  U.S.  has  increased  by  31
percent since 2001; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from
cancer,  heart  disease,  AIDS,  birth  defects,  stroke,  pneumonia,
influenza, and chronic lung disease combined; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many adults miss or dismiss these early signs and symptoms
and young people are even less likely to recognize or understand what is
happening to them; and even when there is some recognition that a  young
person  is  struggling, stigma often causes people to ignore, dismiss or
rationalize a child's true need for help; the result is often as  tragic
as it is unnecessary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  exacerbated pre-existing and
underlying mental illness, with 50  percent  of  Americans  reporting  a
negative impact on their mental health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  these trying times, it is more imperative than ever to
recognize and destigmatize mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, There must be greater public awareness  of  mental  illness
and  suicide,  and  more  must  be done at the local, State and national
levels to respond to the rise in mental health concerns during and after
this crisis; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  of  2023,  as  Mental
Health Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
