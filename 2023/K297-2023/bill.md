  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 30, 2023,  as  Adverse  Childhood  Experiences
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in recognizing days
of  awareness  of  serious  public  health  concerns,  in  the  hopes of
increasing understanding and developing appropriate responses; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 30, 2023, as Adverse Childhood
Experiences Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adverse Childhood  Experiences  (ACEs)  are  the  traumatic
events  experienced  as  a child that can cause toxic stress and trauma,
including:  emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical
neglect, sexual abuse,  substance  abuse  of  a  family  member,  mental
illness  of  a family member, loss of a parent through death or divorce,
incarceration of a parent, and domestic violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research demonstrates that ACEs impact  a  person's  health
and  overall  well-being  into  adulthood,  and  can be passed down from
parent to child, and that reducing ACEs in New  York  State  could  save
tens  of  millions  of  dollars  in  health  care costs related to heart
disease, diabetes, and cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to chronic disease, addiction  and  failure  to
succeed  in  the  workplace  or  in  school  can  often  stem from ACEs;
therefore, reducing exposure to ACEs and mitigating trauma will  improve
both the well-being of our families and our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Identifying  ACEs  is only the first step, and raising the
awareness of the public, policymakers, and those who regularly come into
contact with children is vital in order to put into place  systems  that
preempt  these  challenges  and  improve outcomes for these children and
their parents; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is vital to understand that ACEs  are  preventable,  and
that  for  those already impacted by ACEs, it is essential to help build
resilience, which is defined as adaptation in  the  face  of  adversity,
trauma, tragedy, threats, or stress; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  person  can  build resilience through use of protective
factors, including parental  resilience,  social  connections,  concrete
support  in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development,
and social and emotional competencies of children; as such,  communities
and people who come into contact with children and families on a regular
basis can help strengthen that resiliency; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New York State can help people build resilience by further
investing in primary prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  existence  and  impacts  of  ACEs  are  increasingly
understood  to  constitute  a  public health crisis, yet the response is
woefully inadequate to prevent and mitigate them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 30, 2023, as Adverse
Childhood Experiences Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
