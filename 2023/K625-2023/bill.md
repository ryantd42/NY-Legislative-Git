BY: M. of A. Simpson
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the
  Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical Society
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Hadley-Lake  Luzerne  Historical
Society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical Society is dedicated to
the discovery,  preservation  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  of  the
history of the Towns of Hadley and Lake Luzerne in upstate New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical Society is housed in the
Frances Garnar Kinnear Museum of Local History located at 52 Main Street
in Lake Luzerne; the museum's artifacts depict the evolution of life and
development in the Hadley-Lake Luzerne area across three centuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1973,  long-time Lake Luzerne residents, Eva Reynolds,
Lester Thomas, and Grace Burchino shared a  belief  that  people  should
become aware of local history, and a meeting was held on April 10, 1973,
with approximately 10 people in attendance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shortly  after  the  Luzerne  Historical  Association  was
formed, the group reached out to Hadley residents  and  by  the  group's
second meeting they became the Hadley-Luzerne Historical Society with 28
members,  including  Ira Gray, famous wilderness guide, poet, and expert
wood whittler; prior to the Society's Charter application, the name  was
once again changed to the Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical Society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  Society's  early  development, Frances Garnar
Kinnear and Lester  Thomas  sealed  the  Society's  concrete  plans  and
connected  the  group  to  its  permanent  home,  the  beautiful  1880's
Victorian house, furnished in the style of the era and  which  currently
displays  artifacts and exhibit rooms illustrating the region's history;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical  Society  remains
true to its mission and offers a platform for historians, archeologists,
and  historical  writers  to speak about their specific disciplines; the
Society offers guided tours of the  Kinnear  Museum  and  hosts  various
community  events  such  as an annual, guided autumn Lantern Walk around
the  Historical  District,  a  self-guided  walking  and  driving  tour
throughout  the  Hadley-Lake  Luzerne area, and letterboxing activities;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, the historical society has a research  library
that holds a variety of resource materials specific to its local history
and genealogy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th Anniversary of the Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical
Society; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Hadley-Lake Luzerne Historical Society.
