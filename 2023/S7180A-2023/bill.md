 as  a  Tier I member on January 1, 1972, who retired from such system on
 September 28, 2010, and who for reasons not ascribable to his own negli-
 gence had his retirement benefits calculated without the inclusion of  a
 lump  sum  payment  for  accumulated vacation, shall have his retirement
 benefits recalculated with such lump sum  payments,  including  interest
 accruing  from  the  date of retirement, if he shall file an application
 therefor with the state comptroller on or before one year of the  effec-
 tive date of this act.
  § 2. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the city of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

 average salary.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 S. 7180--A  3

  TRS
  Receiving Members
  - Number Count:  1
  - Average Age:  76.0
 
  BACKGROUND:  Mr.  Grossman retired as a Tier 1 TRS member on September
 28, 2010. He  currently  receives  an  annual  retirement  allowance  of
 $103,495  per  year under the 50% Joint and Survivor with Pop-Up payment
 option.
  If the proposed  legislation  is  passed,  Mr.  Grossman's  retirement
 allowance would be recalculated to include in his final average salary a
 lump  sum payment he received for unused vacation time, which is a bene-
 fit that is generally not afforded to TRS retirees. The additional cost,
 less any required member contributions paid by Mr. Grossman, to fund the
 increased retirement allowance associated with the proposed  legislation
 would be paid by the City of New York.
  Tier  1  TRS  members  are  generally  permitted  to take an actuarial
 reduction of their retirement  allowance  to  account  for  deficits  in
 member  contributions.  For  purposes of this fiscal note, it is assumed
 that Mr.  Grossman would not pay any owed member contributions resulting
 from the recalculation. Based on  this  assumption  and  application  of
 other  Tier  1  benefit calculation provisions, it is estimated that Mr.
 Grossman's annual retirement allowance would increase to $114,514.  This
 annual increase would apply prospectively as well as retroactively, less
 any  payments previously made, to Mr. Grossman's September 28, 2010 date
 of retirement.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the  Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the impacted
 retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
