  2.  SUCH  REPORT  REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL BE POSTED AND MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE DIVISION  OF  HOUSING
 AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL'S WEBSITE IN A CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS MANNER.
  §  2.  Section  1200  of  the private housing finance law, as added by
 chapter 159 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1200. Statement of legislative findings and purpose. The legislature
 hereby finds and declares that there exists in New York state a  serious
 need for financial and technical resources to assist renters and proper-
 ty  owners to make dwelling units accessible for low and moderate income
 persons with disabilities. Providing assistance with the cost of  adapt-
 ing  homes  will enable many New Yorkers with disabilities to safely and
 comfortably continue to, or return to, live in their residences  instead
 of  residing  in  an  institutional setting. THE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND
 COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL UNDERTAKE  AN  ONGOING  EFFORT  TO  PROMOTE  THE
 AVAILABILITY  OF  THE  ACCESS TO HOME PROGRAM TO ALL ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS
 AND PERSONS WITH ELIGIBLE PROPERTIES, AS THOSE TERMS ARE  DEFINED  UNDER
 THIS  ARTICLE,  BOTH TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND GAUGE
 UNMET NEED.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
