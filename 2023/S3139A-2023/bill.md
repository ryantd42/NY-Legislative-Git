  (G) HOW MANY PERSONS WITH ELIGIBLE  PROPERTIES  WERE  DENIED  AND  THE
 DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION REGARDING SUCH DENIED INDIVIDUALS; AND
  (H) THE AVERAGE TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION OF EACH PROJECT.
  2.  SUCH  REPORT  REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL BE POSTED AND MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE DIVISION  OF  HOUSING
 AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL'S WEBSITE IN A CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS MANNER.
  §  2.  Section  1200  of  the private housing finance law, as added by
 chapter 159 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1200. Statement of legislative findings and purpose. The legislature
 hereby finds and declares that there exists in New York state a  serious
 need for financial and technical resources to assist renters and proper-
 ty  owners to make dwelling units accessible for low and moderate income
 persons with disabilities. Providing assistance with the cost of  adapt-
 ing  homes  will enable many New Yorkers with disabilities to safely and
 comfortably continue to, or return to, live in their residences  instead
 of  residing  in  an  institutional setting. THE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND
 COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL UNDERTAKE  AN  ONGOING  EFFORT  TO  PROMOTE  THE
 AVAILABILITY  OF  THE ACCESS TO HOME PROGRAMS TO ALL ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS
 AND PERSONS WITH ELIGIBLE PROPERTIES, AS THOSE TERMS ARE  DEFINED  UNDER
 THIS  ARTICLE,  BOTH TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND GAUGE
 UNMET NEED.  SUCH ACTIONS SHALL INCLUDE WORKING  WITH  ANY  OTHER  STATE
 AGENCIES  THAT  PROVIDE SERVICES TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES TO PROMOTE
 THE ACCESS TO HOME PROGRAMS. SUCH ACTIONS SHALL ALSO INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT
 LIMITED TO PROVIDING CONTACT AND APPLICATION INFORMATION ON THE  WEBSITE
 FOR  THE  DIVISION  OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL FOR ELIGIBLE APPLI-
 CANTS AND PERSONS WITH ELIGIBLE PROPERTIES WHICH SHALL BE UPDATED  ANNU-
 ALLY.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
