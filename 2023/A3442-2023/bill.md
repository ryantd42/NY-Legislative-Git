 Introduced  by M. of A. STERN -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Ways and Means
 
 AN ACT to amend the tax law,  in  relation  to  the  real  property  tax
  circuit breaker credit
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subparagraph (E) of paragraph 1 and paragraphs 3 and  7  of
 subsection  (e)  of section 606 of the tax law, as amended by chapter 28
 of the laws of 1987 and subparagraph (E) of paragraph 1  as  amended  by
 chapter 105 of the laws of 2006, are amended to read as follows:
  (E)  "Qualifying  real  property taxes" means all real property taxes,
 special ad valorem levies and special assessments, exclusive  of  penal-
 ties  and  interest, levied on the residence of a qualified taxpayer and
 paid during the taxable year less the credit claimed  under  THE  FORMER
 subsection (n-1) of this section. [In addition, for taxable years begin-
 ning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, a quali-
 fied taxpayer may elect to include any additional amount that would have
 been  levied  in the absence of an exemption from real property taxation
 pursuant to section four hundred sixty-seven of the  real  property  tax
 law.]  If  tenant-stockholders in a cooperative housing corporation have
 met the requirements of section two  hundred  sixteen  of  the  internal
 revenue  code  by  which  they  are  allowed a deduction for real estate
 taxes, the amount of taxes so allowable, or which would be allowable  if
 the taxpayer had filed returns on a cash basis, shall be qualifying real
 property  taxes.  If  a residence is owned by two or more individuals as
 joint tenants or tenants in common, and one or more than one  individual
 is not a member of the household, qualifying real property taxes is that
 part  of  such  taxes  on  the  residence  which  reflects the ownership
 percentage of the qualified taxpayer and members of his household. If  a
 residence is an integral part of a larger unit, qualifying real property
 taxes  shall  be  limited  to  that  amount of such taxes paid as may be

 reasonably apportioned to such residence. If a household owns and  occu-
 pies two or more residences during different periods in the same taxable
 year,  qualifying  real  property taxes shall be the sum of the prorated
 qualifying  real property taxes attributable to the household during the
 periods such household occupies each of such residences. If  the  house-
 hold  owns  and  occupies  a  residence for part of the taxable year and
 rents a residence for part of the same taxable year, it may include both
 the proration of qualifying real property taxes on the  residence  owned
 and  the  real  property  tax  equivalent with respect to the months the
 residence is rented. Provided,  however,  for  purposes  of  the  credit
 allowed  under  this  subsection,  qualifying real property taxes may be
 included by a qualified taxpayer only to the extent that  such  taxpayer
 or  the  spouse of such taxpayer occupying such residence for six months
 or more of the taxable year owns or has owned  the  residence  and  paid
 such  taxes.  PROVIDED  FURTHER, HOWEVER, QUALIFYING REAL PROPERTY TAXES
 SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY PORTION OF A  REAL  PROPERTY  TAX  PAID  THAT  WAS
 SUBSEQUENTLY  RETURNED TO THE TAXPAYER BY A TAX CREDIT OR ANY OTHER REAL
 PROPERTY TAX REBATE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE SCHOOL TAX RELIEF
 CREDIT UNDER SUBSECTION (EEE) OF THIS SECTION.
  (3) Determination of credit. (A)  For  qualified  taxpayers  who  have
 attained  the  age of sixty-five years before the beginning of or during
 the  taxable  year  the  amount  of  the  credit  allowable  under  this
 subsection shall be fifty percent, or in the case of a qualified taxpay-
 er  who has elected to include an additional amount pursuant to subpara-
 graph (E) of paragraph one of this subsection, twenty-five  percent,  of
 the  excess  of  real  property taxes or the excess of real property tax
 equivalent determined as follows:
 
  Excess real property taxes are the
  excess of real property tax equiv-
  alent or the excess of qualifying
  real property taxes over  the  fo-
