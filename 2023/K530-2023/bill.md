  WHEREAS, America's military spouses are the backbone of the families
who support our troops during  mission,  deployment,  reintegration  and
reset; and
 
  WHEREAS, Military spouses are silent heroes who are essential to the
strength of the nation, and they serve our country just like their loved
ones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  12,  2023,  as  Military  Spouse
Appreciation  Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Military Spouse Appreciation Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 17, 1984, President Ronald Reagan  recognized  the
profound  importance  of  spousal  commitment  to  the  readiness  and
well-being  of  military  members  with  Proclamation  5184;  Congress
officially  made  Military  Spouse  Appreciation  Day  part  of National
Military Appreciation Month in 1999; and
 
  WHEREAS, Subsequently, the Department of  Defense  standardized  the
date  by declaring the Friday before Mother's Day every year as Military
Spouse Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Military  Spouse  Appreciation  Day,  we  honor  the
contribution  and  sacrifices  made by military spouses whose commitment
and support help to keep our country safe; military spouses truly have a
great impact on our lives and our military communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Military spouses share a bond with each  other,  and  share
valuable information pertaining to military news, benefits, fitness, and
so much more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  celebration  of  Military Spouse Appreciation Day, the
armed forces host special events and  programs  to  inform,  honor,  and
recognize  military  spouses  around the world; events range from spouse
appreciation luncheons to educational workshops, and  spouse  employment
fairs which pay tribute to military spouses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Military Spouse Appreciation Month recognizes the
spouses of those on active duty in all branches  of  the  services,  the
National  Guard  and  Reserves,  military  retirees,  and veterans; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12, 2023, as Military
Spouse Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
