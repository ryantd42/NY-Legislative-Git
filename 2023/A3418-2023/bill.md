 STATE  TO  RECEIVE  HIGH-QUALITY  HEALTH  CARE AND DENTAL SERVICES AT AN

 SERVICES  OR  IS  OTHERWISE DELIVERED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS
 BETWEEN CARRIERS AND PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS;
  (D)  CARRIERS  ARE  ABLE TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF PATIENTS TO PHYSICIANS
 AND DENTISTS THROUGH COMPELLING FINANCIAL  INCENTIVES  FOR  PATIENTS  IN
 THEIR  HEALTH  AND DENTAL BENEFITS PLANS TO UTILIZE ONLY THE SERVICES OF
 PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS WITH WHOM THE CARRIERS HAVE CONTRACTED;
  (E) CARRIERS ALSO CONTROL THE HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL SERVICES RENDERED
 TO PATIENTS THROUGH UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND OTHER MANAGED CARE  TOOLS
 AND ASSOCIATED COVERAGE AND PAYMENT POLICIES;
  (F)  CARRIERS  ARE  OFTEN  ABLE  TO VIRTUALLY DICTATE THE TERMS OF THE
 CONTRACTS THAT THEY OFFER PHYSICIANS AND  DENTISTS  AND  COMMONLY  OFFER
 THESE CONTRACTS ON A TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT BASIS;
  (G)  THE  POWER  OF  CARRIERS TO UNILATERALLY IMPOSE PROVIDER CONTRACT
 TERMS JEOPARDIZES THE ABILITY OF PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS TO DELIVER  THE
 SUPERIOR QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL SERVICES TRADITIONALLY AVAILABLE

 REJECT UNFAIR PROVIDER CONTRACT TERMS OFFERED BY  CARRIERS  THAT  IMPEDE

  (I) INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT AND OTHER UNFAIR PAYMENT TERMS OFFERED BY

 MENT OF THE RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE;
  (K)  THE  INEVITABLE  COLLATERAL REDUCTION AND MIGRATION OF THE HEALTH
 CARE WORK FORCE WILL ALSO HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ECONOMY  OF
 THIS STATE;
  (L)  EMPOWERING INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS TO JOINTLY NEGOTI-
 ATE WITH CARRIERS AS PROVIDED IN THIS  ARTICLE  WILL  HELP  RESTORE  THE
 COMPETITIVE  BALANCE  AND  IMPROVE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETS FOR HEALTH
 CARE AND DENTAL SERVICES IN THIS STATE, THEREBY PROVIDING  BENEFITS  FOR
 CONSUMERS, PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AND LESS DOMINANT CARRIERS;
  (M) THIS ARTICLE IS NECESSARY AND PROPER, AND CONSTITUTES AN APPROPRI-
 ATE  EXERCISE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THIS STATE TO REGULATE THE BUSINESS OF
 INSURANCE AND THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL SERVICES;
  (N) THE PRO-COMPETITIVE AND OTHER BENEFITS OF THE  JOINT  NEGOTIATIONS
 AND  RELATED  JOINT  ACTIVITY AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, RESTORING THE COMPETITIVE  BALANCE  IN  THE  MARKET  FOR
 HEALTH CARE SERVICES, PROTECTING ACCESS TO QUALITY PATIENT CARE, PROMOT-

 ARTICLE; AND
  (O)  IT  IS  THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO AUTHORIZE INDEPENDENT
