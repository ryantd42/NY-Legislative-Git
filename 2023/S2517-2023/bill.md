 CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THE BUILDING SERVICE EMPLOYEES WERE
 NOT PAID THE WAGES AND SUPPLEMENTS REQUIRED UNDER THIS ARTICLE.

 as added by chapter 777 of the laws of  1971,  is  amended  to  read  as

 IS  A  CITY COMPTROLLER OR OTHER ANALOGOUS OFFICER, THE PENALTY SHALL BE
 PAID TO SAID OFFICER FOR DEPOSIT IN THE CITY TREASURY.

 AWARD  THE  EMPLOYEE, IN ADDITION TO OTHER RELIEF, HIS OR HER REASONABLE
