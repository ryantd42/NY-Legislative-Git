 OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE SERVING IN THE EXECUTIVE  CHAMBER  OF  THE  GOVERNOR
 SHALL BE INELIGIBLE FOR ANY SUCH APPOINTMENT.
  Except  for  members who serve as members by virtue of holding a civil
 office of the state, [the majority of]  the  remaining  members  of  the
 governing  body  of  every state or local authority shall be independent
 members; provided, however, that this provision shall apply to  appoint-
 ments  made  on  or  after  the  effective date of chapter seven hundred
 sixty-six of the laws of two thousand five which added this subdivision.
 The official or officials having the authority to appoint or remove such
 remaining members shall take such actions as may be necessary to satisfy
 this requirement and further, shall consider the  prospective  diversity
 of  the members of a state authority when making their determinations to
 appoint any member. For the purposes of  this  section,  an  independent

  §  3.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  1  and subdivisions 2 and 4 of
 section 856 of the general municipal law, paragraph (a) of subdivision 1
 and subdivision 4 as added by chapter 1030  of  the  laws  of  1969  and
 subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 356 of the laws of 1993, are amended
 and a new subdivision 5 is added to read as follows:
  (a)  Upon  the  establishment  of  an industrial development agency by
 special act of the legislature, the governing body of  the  municipality
 for  whose  benefit  such  agency  is  established shall file within six
 months after the effective date of the special act  of  the  legislature
 establishing  such  agency  or  before  the  first day of July, nineteen
 hundred sixty-nine, whichever date shall be later, in the office of  the
 secretary of state, a certificate setting forth: (1) the date of passage
 of  the special act establishing the agency; (2) the name of the agency;
 (3) the names of the members and their terms of office, specifying which
 member is the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON; and  (4)  facts  establishing  the
 need for the establishment of an agency in such municipality.
  2.  An agency shall be a corporate governmental agency, constituting a
 public benefit corporation. Except as otherwise provided by special  act
 of  the  legislature, an agency shall consist of not less than three nor
 more than seven members who shall be appointed by the governing body  of
 each  municipality and who shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing
 authority. Such members may include representatives of local government,
 school boards, organized labor and business. A member shall continue  to
 hold  office  until his OR HER successor is appointed and has qualified.
 The governing body  of  each  municipality  shall  designate  the  first
 [chairman]  CHAIRPERSON  and  file with the secretary of state a certif-
 icate of appointment or reappointment of any member. Such members  shall
 receive  no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to the
 necessary  expenses,  including  traveling  expenses,  incurred  in  the
 discharge of their duties.
  4.  Any  one or more of the members of an agency may be an official or
 an employee of the municipality. In the event that  an  official  or  an
 employee of the municipality shall be appointed as a member of the agen-
 cy,  acceptance  or  retention of such appointment shall not be deemed a
 forfeiture of his OR HER municipal office or employment, or incompatible
 therewith or affect his OR HER tenure or compensation in  any  way.  The
 term of office of a member of an agency who is an official or an employ-
 ee of the municipality when appointed as a member thereof by special act
 of  the  legislature  creating  the  industrial development agency shall
 terminate at the expiration of the term of his OR HER municipal office.

  §  4.  Subdivision  1  of section 4 of section 1 of chapter 174 of the

 the  superintendent of financial services, the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON of
 the New York state science and technology foundation, and  seven  direc-
 tors  to be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the

 OF  THEIR  SERVICE.  From  the  seven  directors appointed by [him,] the
 governor, HE OR SHE shall designate the [chairman]  CHAIRPERSON  of  the
 corporation  and  two  others who shall all serve at the pleasure of the
 governor. Of the four remaining directors, one of such  directors  first

 as amended shall serve for a term ending January first  next  succeeding
 his  OR  HER  appointment,  one of such directors shall serve for a term
 ending one year from such date, one of such directors shall serve for  a
 term  ending  two  years from such date, and one of such directors shall
 serve for a term ending three years from  such  date.  Their  successors
 shall  serve  for  terms of four years each. Directors shall continue in
 office until their successors have been appointed and qualified. In  the
 event  of  a  vacancy  occurring  in  the office of a director by death,
 resignation or otherwise, the governor shall appoint  a  successor  with
 the  advice  and  consent  of the senate to serve for the balance of the
 unexpired term. The governor shall appoint the president of  the  corpo-
 ration,  with  the  advice  and  consent of the senate, who shall be the
 chief executive officer of the corporation and who shall  serve  at  the
 pleasure  of  the  governor.  Such president may be one of the directors
 appointed by the governor.
