according to His will; and

the Church of the Holy Spirit continues Reverend John Fox's tradition of
welcoming all; and

retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and

enduring religious institutions and to bring such  institutions  to  the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Church of the  Holy  Spirit  of
East  Greenbush,  New  York,  fully  confident  that  this commemoration
reflects the belief in  those  values  which  enhance  the  dignity  and
