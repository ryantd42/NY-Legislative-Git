  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  380-j  of the general business law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision (i) to read as follows:
  (I) NO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY SHALL COLLECT, EVALUATE,  REPORT,  OR
 MAINTAIN  IN  THE  FILE  ON A CONSUMER THE CONSUMER'S USE OF INTERNET OR
 INTERNET VIEWING HISTORY AS A FACTOR TO DETERMINE THE CONSUMER'S  CREDIT
 WORTHINESS, CREDIT STANDING OR CREDIT CAPACITY.
  §  2.  Section  352  of  the  banking law is amended by adding a new
 seventh undesignated paragraph to read as follows:
  NO LICENSEE SHALL COLLECT, EVALUATE, REPORT OR MAINTAIN IN THE FILE ON
 A BORROWER THE BORROWER'S USE OF INTERNET OR INTERNET VIEWING HISTORY AS
 A FACTOR TO DETERMINE THE BORROWER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS, CREDIT  STANDING
 OR  CREDIT  CAPACITY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE ENFORCED
 CONCURRENTLY BY THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE  DIVISION  OF
 CONSUMER  PROTECTION AND EACH SHALL UTILIZE THEIR CONSUMER COMPLAINT AND
 ASSISTANCE HOTLINES TO DOCUMENT COMPLAINTS BY BORROWERS WHO BELIEVE THAT
 THEIR INTERNET VIEWING HISTORY IS BEING USED TO DENY  THEM  CREDIT.  THE
 SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL ENSURE THAT THE CREDIT SCORING FORMULAS FILED WITH
 THE DEPARTMENT DO NOT CONTAIN VARIABLES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR INTERNET VIEW-
 ING HISTORY AS PART OF THAT FORMULA BY ASKING THE LICENSEE TO CERTIFY TO
 THAT FACT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
