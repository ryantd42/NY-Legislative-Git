 identifying  data  and numbers of such ballots is filed with the balance
 of ballots described in this section, for the balance of  the  two  year

  9.  The county board of elections shall, as soon as practicable and in
 any event, not later than seven days after receipt by it of the applica-
 tion, verify the identity of the applicant. In order to do so, the coun-
 ty board of elections shall utilize  the  information  provided  in  the
 application and shall attempt to verify such information with the infor-
 mation  provided  by  the  department of motor vehicles, social security
 administration and any other lawful available information source. If the
 county board of elections is unable to verify the identity of the appli-
 cant within seven days of the receipt of the application, it shall imme-
 diately take steps to confirm  that  the  information  provided  by  the
 applicant was accurately utilized by such county board of elections, was
 accurately  verified  with  other  information  sources and that no data
 entry error,  or  other  similar  type  of  error,  occurred.  Following
 completion  of  the preceding steps, the county board of elections shall
 mail (a) a notice of its approval, (b) a notice of  its  approval  which
 includes  an  indication that such board has not yet been able to verify
 the identity of the applicant and a request for more information so that
 such verification may be completed, or (c) a notice of its rejection  of
 the  application  to the applicant in a form approved by the state board
 of elections. Notices of approval, notices of approval with requests for
 more information or notices of rejection shall be sent by nonforwardable
 first class or return postage guaranteed mail on which is endorsed  such
 language  designated  by  the  state board of elections to ensure postal
 authorities do not forward such mail but  return  it  to  the  board  of
 elections  with  forwarding  information, when it cannot be delivered as
 addressed and which contains a request that any such mail  received  for
 persons  not  residing  at  the address be dropped back in the mail. The
 voter's registration and enrollment shall be complete  upon  receipt  of
 the  application by the appropriate county board of elections. The fail-
 ure of a county board of elections to  verify  an  applicant's  identity
 shall  not  be  the  basis  for  the rejection of a voter's application,
 provided, however, that such verification failure shall be the basis for
 requiring county board of elections to take the additional  verification
 steps  provided by this chapter. The notice shall also advise the regis-
 trant of the date when their registration and enrollment  is  effective,
 of  the  date  and  the hours of the next regularly scheduled primary or
 general election in which such registrant will be eligible to  vote,  of
 the location of the polling place of the election district in which such
 registrant  is  or will be a qualified voter, whether such polling place
 is accessible to physically handicapped voters, an indication  that  ANY
 REGISTERED VOTER MAY VOTE EARLY BY MAIL AND INFORMATION ON HOW TO OBTAIN
 AN  EARLY  MAIL BALLOT, THAT physically handicapped voters or voters who
 are ill or voters who will be out of the city or county on  the  day  of
 the  primary  or general election, may obtain an absentee ballot and the
 phone number to call for absentee ballot applications, the phone numbers
 S. 7394  18
 
 to call for location of polling places, to obtain registration forms and
 the phone number to call to indicate that the voter is willing to  serve
 on  election  day as an inspector, poll clerk or interpreter. The notice
 of  approval,  notice  of  approval with request for more information or
 notice of rejection shall also advise the applicant to notify the  board
 of elections if there is any inaccuracy. The form of such mail notifica-
 tion  shall  be  prescribed  by  the  state board of elections and shall
 contain such other information and instructions  as  it  may  reasonably
 require  to carry out the purposes of this section. The request for more
 information shall inform the voter that  "THE  FAILURE  TO  CONTACT  THE
 BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS  AND CORRECT ANY INACCURACIES IN THE APPLICATION OR
 PROVIDE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT  IN  A  REQUEST  FOR
 IDENTIFICATION  AT  THE  POLLS  IN  ORDER  TO  CAST  A  VOTE ON A VOTING
 MACHINE." If such notice is returned undelivered without a new  address,
 the  board  shall  forthwith  send  such applicant a confirmation notice
 pursuant to the provisions of section 5-712 of this  article  and  place
 such  applicant  in  inactive status. The state board of elections shall
 prepare uniform notices by this section as provided for  in  subdivision
 eight of section 3-102 of this chapter.

 ance as required of participating agencies.
  (b)  The  state  university of New York and the city university of New

 pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision publicly available on  its

 voting,  the  board of elections shall proceed in the manner hereinafter
 prescribed to review, cast and canvass EARLY MAIL, any  absentee,  mili-
 tary, special presidential, special federal or other special ballots and
 any  ballots  cast  in  affidavit  envelopes.  Each such ballot shall be
 retained in the original envelope containing the voter's  affidavit  and
 signature, in which it is delivered to the board of elections until such
 time as it is to be reviewed, in order to be cast and canvassed.
  1.  Central board of canvassers. Within four days of the receipt of an
 EARLY MAIL, absentee, military or special ballot, the board of elections
 shall designate itself or such of its employees as it shall deem  appro-
 priate  as  a  set  of  poll clerks to review such ballot envelopes. The
 board may designate additional sets of poll clerks and if it  designates
 more  than one such set shall apportion among all such sets the election
 districts from which such ballots have been received, provided that when
 reviewing ballots, all ballots from a single election district shall  be
 assigned  to  a  single  set  of clerks, and that each such set shall be
 divided equally between  representatives  of  the  two  major  political
 parties.  Each  such  set  of  clerks shall be deemed a central board of
 canvassers for purposes of this section.
  Review of EARLY MAIL, absentee, military and special ballot envelopes.
 Within four days of the receipt of an EARLY MAIL, absentee, military  or
 special  ballot before the election, and within one day of receipt on or

 write-in absentee ballots validly cast by a military voter for all ques-
 tions  or proposals, public offices or party positions for which a mili-
 tary voter is otherwise eligible to vote as provided in  section  10-104
 of this chapter.
 S. 7394  23
 
  (b)  Federal  write-in absentee ballots shall be deemed valid only if:
 (i) an application for an EARLY  MAIL,  absentee,  military  or  special
 federal  ballot  was received from the EARLY MAIL, absentee, military or
 special federal voter; (ii) the federal  write-in  absentee  ballot  was
 submitted  from  inside or outside the United States by a military voter
 or was submitted from outside the United States  by  a  special  federal
 voter; (iii) such ballot is received by the board of elections not later
 than  thirteen  days following the day of election or seven days after a
 primary election; and (iv) the EARLY MAIL, absentee, military or special

 board  of  canvassers  shall  thereupon, as nearly as practicable in the
 manner provided in this article for EARLY MAIL, absentee,  military  and
 special  ballots,  verify the number of ballots so cast, tally the votes
 so cast, add such tally to the previous tally of all votes cast in  such
 election district, and record the result.
  (a)  Within four business days of the election, the board of elections
 shall review all affidavit ballots cast in the election. If the  central
 board  of  canvassers  determines  that a person was entitled to vote at
 such election it shall cast and canvass such affidavit ballot; provided,
 however, if the board of elections receives one  or  more  timely  EARLY
 MAIL  OR absentee ballots from a voter who also cast an affidavit ballot
 at a poll site, the last such  timely  EARLY  MAIL  OR  absentee  ballot
 received  shall be canvassed and the affidavit ballot shall be set aside
 unopened; and provided further, if a voter was issued an EARLY  MAIL  OR
 absentee  ballot  and  votes  in  person via an affidavit ballot and the
 board does not receive such EARLY MAIL OR absentee ballot, the affidavit
 ballot shall be canvassed if the voter is otherwise qualified to vote in
 such election.
  (k) The board of elections shall enter  information  into  the  ballot
 tracking  system,  as  defined  in [section] SECTIONS 8-414 AND 8-712 of
 this chapter, to allow a voter who cast a ballot in an EARLY  VOTING  OR
 affidavit envelope to determine if the vote was counted.
  Post-election  review  of  invalid  EARLY MAIL, absentee, military and
 special ballots. (a) Within four business  days  of  the  election,  the
 board  of  elections  shall designate itself or such of its employees to
 act as a central board of canvassers as provided in subdivision  one  of
 this  section  and  meet  to  review  EARLY MAIL, absentee, military and
 special ballots determined to be invalid pursuant to  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision  two of this section, ballot envelopes that were returned to
 the board as undeliverable, and ballot envelopes containing one or  more
 curable defects that have not been timely cured.
  9. State board of elections; powers and duties for canvassing of EARLY
 MAIL, absentee, military, special and affidavit ballots. The state board
 of  elections  shall  promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the
 implementation of the provisions of this section. Such rules  and  regu-
 lations  shall  include, but not be limited to, provisions to (a) ensure
 an efficient and fair review process that respects the  privacy  of  the
 voter, (b) ensure the security of the central count scanners used before
 election  day,  and  (c)  ensure  that  ballots cast as provided in this
 section are canvassed and counted as if cast on election day.

 pursuant  to  paragraph  c  of subdivision one of section 15-104 of this
 article, the other provisions of this chapter governing the  conduct  of
 elections  and  proceedings  relating  thereto, including the manner and
 times for making nominations and proceedings relating to EARLY MAIL  AND

 with other provisions of this chapter shall apply to such elections.
  § 32. Subdivision 8 of section 15-118 of the election law, as  amended
 by chapter 217 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:
  8.  The  village  clerk  shall  furnish the inspectors of election, at

 held.
  § 33. Subdivisions 1 and 5 of section 16-106 of the election  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  763  of  the  laws of 2021, are amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The post-election refusal to cast: (a)  challenged  ballots,  blank
 ballots,  or  void ballots; (b) EARLY MAIL, absentee, military, special,
 or federal write-in ballots; (c)  emergency  ballots;  and  (d)  ballots
 voted in affidavit envelopes may be contested in a proceeding instituted
 in  the supreme or county court, by any candidate or the chairman of any
 party committee, and by any voter with respect to the  refusal  to  cast
 such voter's ballot, against the board of canvassers of the returns from
 such  district, if any, and otherwise against the board of inspectors of
 election of such district. If the court determines that the  person  who
 cast  such  ballot was entitled to vote at such election, it shall order
 such ballot to be cast and canvassed, including if the court finds  that
 ministerial  error  by  the  board  of elections or any of its employees
 caused such ballot envelope not to be valid on its face.
  5. In the event  procedural  irregularities  or  other  facts  arising
 during  the  election suggest a change or altering of the canvass sched-
 S. 7394  26
 
 ule, as provided for in section 9-209 of this chapter, may be warranted,
 a candidate may seek an order for temporary  or  preliminary  injunctive
 relief  or  an impound order halting or altering the canvassing schedule
 of  EARLY  MAIL,  absentee, military, special or affidavit ballots. Upon
 any such application, the board or boards of elections have a  right  to
 be  heard.  To obtain such relief, the petitioner must meet the criteria
 in article sixty-three of the civil practice law and rules and  show  by
 clear  and  convincing evidence, that, because of procedural irregulari-
 ties or other facts arising during the election, the petitioner will  be
 irreparably harmed absent such relief. For the purposes of this section,
 allegations  that opinion polls show that an election is close is insuf-
 ficient to show irreparable harm to a petitioner by clear and convincing
 evidence.
  § 34. Subdivision 4 of section 16-108 of the election law  is  amended
 to read as follows:
  4.  Such  court,  justice  or judge, in a proceeding instituted by any

  PROVIDED FURTHER THAT, A PERSON WHOSE ABSENTEE BALLOT  APPLICATION  IS
 PROCESSED  AS AN EARLY MAIL BALLOT APPLICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-402

 or  refrain  from  voting  in  general  or for or against any particular
 person or for or against any proposition submitted  to  voters  at  such
 election; to place or refrain from placing their name upon a registry of
 voters; or to request or refrain from requesting an EARLY MAIL OR absen-
 tee ballot; or
  (ii)  a  person  knowingly  uses  any  deceptive or fraudulent device,
 contrivance or communication, that impedes, prevents or otherwise inter-
 feres with the free exercise of the elective franchise by any person, or

 a city with less than  one  hundred  twenty-five  thousand  inhabitants,
 according  to  the latest federal census, by a majority vote taken at an
 annual or special meeting of such district shall adopt a proposition  to

 IN THE BALLOT BOX SHALL BE ADDED TO THE NUMBER OF OTHER BALLOTS DEPOSIT-
 ED  IN THE BALLOT BOX IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF ALL BALLOTS TO
