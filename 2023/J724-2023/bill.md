  HONORING Firefighter Robert West upon the occasion
  of  his designation for special recognition after 52
  years of dedicated service to the Lowville Volunteer
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Robert West upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition
after  52  years  of  dedicated  service  to the Lowville Volunteer Fire
Department to be celebrated at an Annual Banquet on Saturday, April  22,
2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robert "Bob" West has over five decades of service between
two fire departments, joining the Martinsburg Volunteer Fire  Department
in  1971,  serving for 13 years, and later joined the Lowville Volunteer
Fire Department in December of 1984; throughout his 52 years of service,
he held several positions within the Department including being a member
of the House Committee, making choices that will benefit the good of the
Department, and is a driver, bringing  the  appropriate  apparatuses  to
scenes of emergencies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighter  Robert  West  has taken part in many parades,
conventions, and fairs, always jumping at an opportunity to display  his
rightful pride in the Department and Village; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State
with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers  are  often
the  first  to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Robert West is one such firefighter;  throughout  52  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Robert West upon the occasion of his  designation  for
special  recognition after 52 years of dedicated service to the Lowville
Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Robert West.
