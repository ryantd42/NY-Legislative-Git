 typewritten  or  printed  [in  English  and  Spanish]  notices  in  form
 prescribed by the chairman, stating the fact that he has  complied  with
 all  the rules and regulations of the chairman and the board and that he
 has secured the payment of  compensation  to  his  employees  and  their

 report for work at an established place of business maintained  by  such

 deposited into the uninsured employers' fund.

 employee  as  to his or her employment because such employee has claimed
 or attempted to claim compensation  from  such  employer,  [requested  a
 claim  form  for  injuries  received  in  the  course of employment,] or
