 that  in  order  to  increase  employment of state residents, especially
 construction workers, it shall invest in public works projects.
  The legislature further declares that channeling funds to such  public
 works  projects  for  the  employment  of qualified local residents will
 reduce unemployment while improving the welfare  of  its  residents  and
 facilitating the completing of public works projects more quickly, effi-
 ciently and economically.
  Therefore, the legislature declares that in certain limited situations
 there shall be a preference for qualified local labor.

 follows:

 SUBDIVISION,  MUNICIPAL CORPORATION, PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION OR LOCAL
 OR STATE AUTHORITY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PUBLIC  WORK  DETERMINES

 RATE CASE OF FAILURE TO EMPLOY QUALIFIED LOCAL RESIDENTS ON PUBLIC WORKS
 PROJECTS CONSTITUTES A SEPARATE OFFENSE.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law and shall control all contracts advertised or solicit-
 ed for bid on or after such effective date.
