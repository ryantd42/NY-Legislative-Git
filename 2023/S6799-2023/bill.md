 two and have been retired for [five] TWO years; (ii) all pensioners  who
 have attained age fifty-five and have been retired for [ten] FIVE years;
 (iii)  all disability pensioners regardless of age who have been retired
 for  [five]  TWO  years;  and (iv) all recipients of an accidental death

 [five] TWO years.
  § 4. Subdivision a of section 13-696 of the administrative code of the

 education  retirement  system  or  the  relief  and  pension fund of the
 department of street cleaning provided for in  subchapter  one  of  this
 chapter  on  the  basis provided for in this section to: (i) all retired
 members who have attained age sixty-two and have been retired for [five]

  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would expand eligibility for the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living  adjustment  (COLA)  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System. Effective immediately, COLA will be payable to
  1. Service pensioners aged sixty-two years and retired two years,
  2. Service pensioners aged fifty-five years and retired five years,
  3. Disability pensioners regardless of age once retired two years, and
  4. Accidental death beneficiaries after receiving a  benefit  for  two
 years.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2023 legislative session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.8 billion.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $1.62 billion as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in the NYSLERS is 0.12% of billable  salary,  or
 approximately $15 million to the State of New York and approximately $22
 million to local participating employers in the fiscal year ending March
 31,  2025.  This  PERMANENT  ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent billing
 cycles with changes in the billing  rate  and  salary  of  the  affected
 members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative session,
 S. 6799  3
 
 the increase in the present value of  benefits  would  be  approximately
 $162 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1-5  $140 million  $86 million
  Tier 6  $22 million  $76 million
  Total  $162 million  $162 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $3.4 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $14  million  to  the  local  participating employers in the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary  in  subse-
 quent  billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of the
 affected members.

 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2022 Report of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate, dated March 30, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No.  2023-18  Revised,
 prepared  by  the  Actuary  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State TeachersÆ Retirement System,  this
 bill  would amend subdivision a of Section 532-a of the Education Law to
 change the eligibility for the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for  all
 current  and  future  retirees.  Retirees  retired  for service would be
 eligible for the COLA upon attainment of age sixty-two with two years of
 retirement or age fifty-five with five years of retirement. The  current
 COLA  eligibility  requirement  is attainment of age sixty-two with five
 years of retirement or age fifty-five  with  ten  years  of  retirement.
 Disability  retirees  would  be  eligible for the COLA regardless of age
 with two years  of  retirement  instead  of  the  five  years  currently
 required.  Recipients of an accidental death benefit would be eligible
 for the COLA regardless of age after  receiving  such  benefit  for  two
 years instead of the five years currently required.
 S. 6799  4
 
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $67.8
 million or 0.37% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  Member  data  is  from  the  System's  most recent actuarial valuation
 files, consisting of data provided by the employers  to  the  Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the System's
 Annual Report. System assets are as reported in the  System's  financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al  assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-8  dated  February  7,
 2023  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2023
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New
 York City Retirement Systems and  Pension  Funds  (NYCRS),  would  amend
 Section  13-696  of  the  Administrative  Code  of  the City of New York
 (ACCNY) to accelerate  eligibility  for  the  Cost-of-Living  Adjustment
 (COLA)  for  service, vested, and disabled retirees and accidental death
 recipients of the New York City Employees' Retirement  System  (NYCERS),
 the  New  York  City  Teachers' Retirement System (NYCTRS), the New York
 City Board of Education Retirement System  (BERS),  the  New  York  City
 Police  Pension  Fund  (POLICE), and the New York City Fire Pension Fund
 (FIRE).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Under this proposed legislation, the time  periods
 for COLA eligibility would be reduced as follows:
  * From age 62 and retired for five years to age 62 and retired for two
 years
  *  From age 55 and retired for 10 years to age 55 and retired for five
 years
  * From disabled retirees who are  retired  for  five  years  to  those
 retired for two years
  * From accidental death benefit recipients who have been receiving the
 benefit for five years to those receiving the benefit for two years
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  The  estimated  financial  impact  to  NYCRS is an
 increase in Present Value  of  Future  Benefits  of  approximately  $1.3
 billion  and  an  increase  in Fiscal Year 2024 annual employer contrib-
 utions of approximately $666.0 million.
  The increase in Fiscal Year  2024  annual  employer  contributions  of
 $666.0  million  is estimated to be $491.5 million for New York City and
 $174.5 million for the other obligors  of  NYCRS.  A  breakdown  of  the
 financial impact by System is shown in the table below.
 
  NYCRS  Additional Present  Estimated First Year
  Value of Future Benefits  Annual Employer
  ($ Millions)  Contributions*
  ($ Millions)
  NYCERS  $664.4  $363.3
  NYCTRS  359.6  168.6
  BERS  73.6  35.5
 S. 6799  5
 
  POLICE  117.5  74.2
  FIRE  49.9  24.4
  Total  $1,265.0  $666.0
 
  *  Total  employer contributions are reduced by $572 million after the
 first year due to the 1-year amortization of  the  UAL  attributable  to
 current retirees.
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted  by  the  benefit changes. For purposes of this Fiscal Note, it
 has been assumed that increases in UAL attributable to current  retirees
 would  be  recognized immediately and that increases in UAL attributable
 to active members would be amortized over periods ranging from 12 to  15
 years  depending  on  the  System  (11 to 14 payments under One-Year Lag
 Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCRS to determine
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods to be
 used for the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 NYCRS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuations  of NYCRS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
