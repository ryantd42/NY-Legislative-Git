 THE CONTINUED, UNINTERRUPTED, ADEQUATE AND EFFICIENT OPERATION  OF  FIRE
 AND  EMERGENCY  MEDICAL SERVICES IS NECESSARY FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE OF
 THE PEOPLE AND  THAT  SUCH  ADEQUATE  OPERATION  INVOLVES  AND  REQUIRES
 PERSONNEL  WITH  HIGHLY  SPECIALIZED  ABILITY, SKILL, TRAINING AND KNOW-
 LEDGE, WHICH NECESSITATES THAT VACANCIES IN THE  FIRE  ALARM  DISPATCHER
 SERVICE  IN  THE  POSITION OF SUPERVISING FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER LEVEL II
 SHALL BE FILLED AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE BY PROMOTION  FROM  AMONG  PERSONS
 CURRENTLY HOLDING PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPERVISING FIRE ALARM
 DISPATCHER  LEVEL  II  POSITION,  AS WELL AS PERSONS HOLDING COMPETITIVE
 CLASS POSITIONS IN A LOWER GRADE IN THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THE  VACANCY
 EXISTS,  PROVIDED  THAT SUCH LOWER GRADE POSITIONS ARE IN DIRECT LINE OF
 PROMOTION, AS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR MUNICIPAL COMMISSION.  THE
 LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS AND DECLARES THAT  WHEN  NEITHER  AN  ELIGIBLE
 LIST  NOR A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION FOR A TITLE EXISTS, ALLOWING CITY OF
 NEW YORK EMPLOYERS  AND  THE  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THEIR  EMPLOYEES  TO,
 THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS, AGREE TO AN ALTERNATIVE EXAM-
 INATION  METHOD  TO MEASURE THE MERIT AND FITNESS OF EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY
 HOLDING PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENTS TO SUCH TITLE, SUCH AGREEMENT  ADVANCES
 THE  GOAL  OF  REDUCING  THE  NUMBER  OF EMPLOYEES HOLDING A PROVISIONAL
