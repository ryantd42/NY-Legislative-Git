 paid  in  all  four  calendar  quarters during his or her base period or

 paid  in  all  four  calendar  quarters during his or her base period or
 alternate base period  and  whose  high  calendar  quarter  remuneration
 during  the  base  period  is  three  thousand five hundred seventy-five

 twenty-sixth  of  the average remuneration paid in the two highest quar-

 who  has  remuneration paid in two or three calendar quarters during his
 or her base period or alternate base  period  and  whose  high  calendar
 quarter  remuneration  during  the  base  period  is three thousand five
 hundred seventy-five dollars or less, the benefit amount  shall  be  one
 twenty-fifth  of the remuneration paid during the highest calendar quar-
 ter of the base period by employers liable for contributions or payments
 in lieu of contributions under this article.  Any  claimant  whose  high
 calendar  quarter remuneration during the base period is more than three
 thousand five hundred seventy-five dollars shall not have a weekly bene-
 fit amount less than one hundred forty-three dollars. The weekly benefit
