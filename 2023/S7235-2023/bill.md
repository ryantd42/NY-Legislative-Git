  2.  THE  CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PLAN SHALL INCLUDE ANY EXEMPTIONS TO THE
 CLASS SIZE TARGETS. THESE EXEMPTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO:  (I)  SPACE;
 (II)  OVER-ENROLLED  STUDENTS;  (III)  STAFF  SHORTAGES; AND (IV) SEVERE
 ECONOMIC DISTRESS. ANY SUCH EXEMPTIONS SHALL BE APPROVED BY  THE  SUPER-
 INTENDENT  AND  THE PRESIDENT OF EACH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT REPRES-
 ENTING THE TEACHERS, OTHER  CLASSROOM  STAFF,  AND  THE  BUILDING  LEVEL
 ADMINISTRATIVE  STAFF  AS  PART OF THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PLAN. SHOULD
 THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF EACH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING  UNIT
 REPRESENTING  THE  TEACHERS AND THE PRINCIPALS BE UNABLE TO REACH AGREE-
 MENT ON THE EXEMPTIONS AFTER THIRTY DAYS, THE ISSUE SHALL BE  DETERMINED
 BY  AN  ARBITRATOR.  IN ADDITION, ANY EXEMPTION BASED ON AVAILABLE SPACE
 SHALL INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THE CAPITAL BUDGET TO DEMONSTRATE THAT  THE
 BUDGET IS ALIGNED WITH RESOLVING THE EXEMPTION STATUS. EXEMPTED CLASSES,
 FOR  THE  YEARS  IN WHICH THEY ARE EXEMPT, AND SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES
 SHALL NOT COUNT TOWARD THE TWENTY PERCENT TARGET.
  3. THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PLAN SHALL ALSO INCLUDE THE METHODS TO  BE
 USED  TO  ACHIEVE  THE  CLASS  SIZE  TARGETS,  SUCH  AS  THE CREATION OR
 CONSTRUCTION OF MORE CLASSROOMS AND SCHOOL BUILDINGS, THE  PLACEMENT  OF
 MORE  THAN ONE TEACHER IN A CLASSROOM OR METHODS TO OTHERWISE REDUCE THE
 STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO, BUT ONLY AS A  TEMPORARY  MEASURE  UNTIL  MORE
 CLASSROOMS ARE MADE AVAILABLE IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE PLAN. FOR ELECTIVE
 AND  SPECIALTY  CLASSES,  THE  COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING  UNIT REPRESENTING
 TEACHERS MAY NEGOTIATE CLASS SIZES  HIGHER  THAN  THE  TARGETS  IF  SUCH
 INCREASE IS APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF THE TEACHING STAFF IN THE SCHOOL.
  4. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL PREPARE ANNUAL REPORTS, ON THE DATES SET
 FORTH  BELOW, TO THE COMMISSIONER ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
 ITS PLAN TO REDUCE ACTUAL CLASS SIZES AS SET FORTH HEREIN.  SUCH  REPORT
 SHALL  BE PUBLICLY RELEASED AND POSTED ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S WEBSITE,
 AND SHALL FURTHER  PROVIDE  THE  FOLLOWING  INFORMATION  REGARDING  SUCH
 SCHOOLS:
  (A)  THE ACTUAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT FOR THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR AND THE
 PROJECTED STUDENT ENROLLMENT FOR  THE  UPCOMING  SCHOOL  YEAR  FOR  EACH
 SCHOOL BY GRADE LEVEL;
  (B)  THE  ACTUAL  CLASS  SIZES  FOR  THE  CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR, AND THE
 PROJECTED CLASS SIZES FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR FOR  EACH  SCHOOL  BY
 GRADE LEVEL;
  (C)  THE  ANNUAL  CAPITAL  PLAN FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND LEASING TO
 SHOW HOW MANY CLASSROOMS WILL BE ADDED IN EACH YEAR AND IN WHICH SCHOOLS
 AND DISTRICTS TO ACHIEVE THE CLASS SIZE TARGETS;
  (D) HOW THE SCHOOL CAPACITY IS ALIGNED TO THE CLASS  SIZE  TARGETS  IN
 THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PLAN; AND
  (E)  THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE MADE INSUFFICIENT PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING
 THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION TARGETS SET FORTH IN THE  APPROVED  CLASS  SIZE
 REDUCTION  PLAN  PURSUANT  TO THIS SECTION AND A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
 THE ACTIONS THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES  IN  SUCH  SCHOOLS.
 THE  REPORT  SHALL  BE  SUBMITTED  TO THE COMMISSIONER ON OR BEFORE JULY
 FIRST OF EACH YEAR AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BY SUCH DATE ON  THE
 SCHOOL DISTRICT'S WEBSITE. IF THE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES THAT THE ANNU-
 AL  REPORT  DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE SUFFICIENT DECREASES IN CLASS SIZE IN A
 DISTRICT, THEN THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ISSUE A STATEMENT  IN  WRITING  TO
 THE  DISTRICT MAKING THAT DETERMINATION AND THE DISTRICT SHALL MAKE SUCH
 STATEMENT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON ITS WEBSITE AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
 SHALL SUBMIT A PLAN FOR CORRECTIVE  ACTION  WITHIN  THIRTY  DAYS,  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  DEVELOPED  IN  COLLABORATION  WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE

 AND  EDUCATION  FUNDING PLANS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SPACE AND STAFFING
 FOR THE REDUCTION IN CLASS SIZE SET FORTH HEREIN AND, IF NOT, WHAT MEAS-
 URES AND/OR FUNDING SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE PLAN TO ACHIEVE SUCH TARGETS.
  5. PROVIDED THE COMMISSIONER APPROVES THE CLASS SIZE  REDUCTION  PLAN,
 ANY  FAILURE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH PLAN WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES

 ORDER  PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED SIX OF THIS
 CHAPTER.
  6. IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORTS, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL SUBMIT
 A FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH, TWO  THOUSAND  TWEN-
 TY-SIX.  THE  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  STATEMENT  MAY RECOMMEND A PAUSE OF THE

 OR INCREASE IN CLASS SIZES.
