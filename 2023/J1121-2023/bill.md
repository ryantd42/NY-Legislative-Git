  WHEREAS, New Granada was a colony under  traditional  Spanish  rule;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1809, Camilo Torres Tenorio wrote his famous Memorial de
Agravios, "Remembrance of Offenses," to the Spanish monarchy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Camilo  Torres  Tenorio  criticized the Spanish Monarchy's
policy of excluding Creoles from  esteemed  positions  in  the  American
colonies; Tenorio alleged that their rights to govern in their homelands
is "the offspring of the conquistadores"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  Granada  felt neglected and abused as a colony of the
Spanish, especially with a figurehead, placed by Napoleon Bonaparte, who
sat on the throne; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the morning of July 20,  1810,  patriots  in  Bogota,  a
holdout  for  Spanish rule, offered a flower vase as an act of good will
to Spanish merchant Joaquin Gonzalez Llorente to beautify a table for  a
celebration  in  honor  of  Antonio  Villavicencio, a well-known patriot
sympathizer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joaquin Camacho visited the palace of the Viceroy,  Antonio
Jose Amar y Borbon, the same morning to request an open council in hopes
of establishing equality for the Creole population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Both  offers  were denied, and an uproar broke out amongst
the populace for representation and equality; and
 
  WHEREAS, Viceroy Antonio Jose Amar y Borbon signed an act  the  very
same  day which permitted a local ruling council, which eventually paved
the way to independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
great contributions which Colombians, such as photographer Miguel Gomez,
mathematician  Guillermo  Owens,  and  fashion  icon  Nina  Garcia, have
brought to our State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  July  20,  2023,  as
Colombian  Independence  Day  in  the  State  of  New York, on the 213th
Anniversary of Colombian Independence; and be it further
