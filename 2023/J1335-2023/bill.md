  COMMEMORATING  the  120th Anniversary of the Glens
  Falls Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proud  to  commemorate  the  120th
Anniversary  of the Glens Fall Fire Department and to honor its past and
present firefighting members for more than a century of fire  protection
to  the  citizens  of  Glens  Falls,  New  York,  and  its  surrounding
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection  services in every locality of our State; during the past 120
years, the courageous and devoted firefighters of the Glens  Falls  Fire
Department valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and have
won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On March 4, 1903, the Board of Trustees for the Village of
Glens Falls met to discuss the  annual  report  of  the  Volunteer  Fire
Department  presented  by Chief John Mack; the 49 fires occurring during
1902 had caused the second largest casualty loss in the  village  behind
the fire of 1864; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  higher insurance rates and constant pressure from
the citizens of the village, the board transitioned the  Volunteer  Fire
Department into a Career Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The transition officially took place on June 8, 1903, with
the first Career Firefighters manning both the Ridge  Street  and  South
Street  Fire  Stations;  in  its  first year of operation the department
responded to 42 alarms for help; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, the  224  Firefighters  of  the  Glens
Falls Fire Department have responded to 3,345 alarms for help; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today, under the able leadership of Chief James Schrammel,
the Glens Falls Fire  Department  remains  committed  to  providing  the
highest level of public safety to the residents and visitors of the City
of  Glens  Falls;  its  members are dedicated to the protection of life,
property and the environment through fire suppression, rescue, emergency
medical service, hazardous materials response and  disaster  management;
to prevent fires and protect life through fire prevention and education;
and to maintain a work environment that values cultural diversity and is
free of harassment and discrimination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by individual firefighters, the Glens Falls Fire Department reflects the
history and development of firefighting over the past 120 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the volunteer fire  departments  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the  120th  Anniversary  of  the  Glens  Falls  Fire
Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Chief James Schrammel, Glens Falls Fire Department.
