 AN ACT requiring the registration and licensing of vehicles
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that unregistered
 and unlicensed vehicles can pose a threat to public safety  and  may  be
 used for criminal activity. It is necessary to regulate the operation of
 vehicles  on  public roads and highways in order to ensure public safety
 and maintain the integrity of the transportation system.  Vehicles  that
 can  travel  over twenty miles per hour are capable of high-speed opera-
 tion and may require special handling and safety considerations.
  § 2. All vehicles that are capable of traveling over twenty miles  per
 hour shall be registered and licensed with the department of motor vehi-
 cles.
  §  3. Any individual who operates a vehicle that is not registered and
 licensed as required by this act shall be subject to penalties and fines
 as determined by the department of motor vehicles.
  § 4. The department of motor vehicles shall establish regulations  and
 guidelines for the registration and licensing of vehicles, including but
 not  limited to safety requirements, insurance requirements, and vehicle
 identification requirements.
  § 5. This act shall take effect one hundred days after it  shall  have
 become  a  law and shall apply to all vehicles operating on public roads
 and highways within the jurisdiction of the state of New York.
