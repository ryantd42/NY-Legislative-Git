 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  requiring
  the  registration  and  licensing of vehicles that have the ability to
  travel over twenty-five miles per hour
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that unregistered
 and  unlicensed  vehicles  can pose a threat to public safety and may be
 used for criminal activity. It is necessary to regulate the operation of
 vehicles on public roads and highways in order to ensure  public  safety
 and  maintain  the integrity of the transportation system. Vehicles that
 can travel over twenty-five miles per hour  are  capable  of  high-speed
 operation and may require special handling and safety considerations.
  §  2.  The  vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new section
 1229-e to read as follows:
  § 1229-E. REGISTRATION AND LICENSING  OF  VEHICLES  THAT  TRAVEL  OVER
 TWENTY-FIVE  MILES PER HOUR.  ALL VEHICLES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF TRAVELING
 OVER TWENTY-FIVE MILES PER HOUR SHALL BE REGISTERED  PURSUANT  TO  TITLE
 FOUR  OR ELEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER AND ISSUED A PLATE NUMBER BY THE DEPART-
 MENT.  NO PERSON SHALL OPERATE A VEHICLE UNLESS SUCH  VEHICLE  HAS  BEEN
 REGISTERED  WITH  THE  DEPARTMENT  AND  HAS A NUMBER PLATE ISSUED BY THE
 COMMISSIONER WITH A NUMBER CORRESPONDING TO THAT OF THE  CERTIFICATE  OF
 REGISTRATION.
  2.  SUCH  NUMBER  PLATES  SHALL  BE OF SUCH MATERIAL, FORM, DESIGN AND
 DIMENSIONS AND CONTAIN OR SET FORTH SUCH DISTINGUISHING NUMBER OR  OTHER
 IDENTIFICATION  MARKS  AS  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL PRESCRIBE, PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THAT THERE SHALL BE AT ALL TIMES A MARKED CONTRAST BETWEEN  THE
 COLOR OF THE NUMBER PLATES AND THAT OF THE NUMERALS OR LETTERS THEREON.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  3. EACH SUCH NUMBER PLATE SHALL BE CONSPICUOUSLY DISPLAYED AND SECURE-
 LY FASTENED ON THE VEHICLE.
  4.  THE  FEE FOR SUCH REGISTRATION AND NUMBER PLATES SHALL BE THE SAME
 AS SET FORTH IN SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS CHAPTER.
  5. ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO OPERATES A VEHICLE THAT IS  NOT  REGISTERED  AND
 LICENSED  AS  REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES AND
 FINES SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION EIGHTEEN OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED  ONE  OF
 THIS CHAPTER.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect one hundred days after it shall have
 become a law and shall apply to all vehicles operating on  public  roads
 and highways within the jurisdiction of the state of New York.
