  Section  1.  Subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  (b) of subdivision 1 of
 section 162 of the civil service law, as amended by section 3 of part  T

  (i) Any and all health insurance coverage mandated by any law, rule or
 regulation,  including  but not limited to coverage mandated pursuant to
 article forty-three of the insurance law, applicable  to  contracts  for
 health  insurance entered into under this section shall be provided in a
 manner assuring uninterrupted continuance of coverage  for  all  covered
 persons. HEALTH BENEFITS SHALL INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT COVERED HEALTH
 CARE  SERVICES  PROVIDED  TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS WILL BE REIMBURSED AT THE
 LEVEL OF AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY COST OF EACH
 OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH  CARE SERVICE.  AS  USED  IN  THIS  SUBPARAGRAPH,
 "USUAL  AND  CUSTOMARY  COST" SHALL MEAN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OF ALL
 CHARGES FOR THE PARTICULAR HEALTH CARE SERVICE PERFORMED BY  A  PROVIDER
 IN  THE  SAME OR SIMILAR SPECIALTY AND PROVIDED IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL
 AREA AS REPORTED IN A BENCHMARKING DATABASE MAINTAINED  BY  A  NONPROFIT
 ORGANIZATION  SPECIFIED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES. For

 the purposes of this paragraph "coverage" shall include but shall not be
 limited to all benefits, services,  rights,  privileges  and  guarantees
 allowed by law;
  §  2.  Subdivision  1  of  section  161-a of the civil service law, as
 amended by section 10 of part T of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2010,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  Where,  and to the extent that, an agreement between the state and
 an employee organization entered into pursuant to  article  fourteen  of
 this  chapter provides for health benefits, the president, after receipt
 of written directions from the director  of  employee  relations,  shall
 implement  the  provisions  of  such agreement consistent with the terms
 thereof and to the extent necessary shall  adopt  regulations  providing
 for  the  benefits  to  be  thereunder provided. The president, with the
 approval of the director of the budget, may  extend  such  benefits,  in
 whole  or in part, PROVIDED THAT SUCH BENEFITS ARE NOT A DIMINISHMENT OF
 CURRENT EXISTING BENEFITS to employees not subject to the provisions  of
 such agreement.
