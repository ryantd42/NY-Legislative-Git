  memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
  May 26, 2023, as Guyanese Independence  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 26, 2023, as  Guyanese
Independence  Day,  in  conjunction  with  the  57th  Anniversary of the
Independence of Guyana; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Co-operative  Republic  of  Guyana  is  a  vibrant  and
prosperous nation in the Caribbean region that enjoys friendly relations
with  our  great  State  and  Nation,  serving  as  a  partner in trade,
diplomacy, culture, and security; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a result of successive waves of  settlement,  Guyana  is
home  to  an  incredibly  diverse  population,  primarily  consisting of
Indo-Guyanese descended from South Asia,  Afro-Guyanese  descended  from
Africa,  Amerindians,  people  of  mixed  ancestry,  and  descendants of
European and Chinese workers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Guyana gained independence from the United Kingdom  on  May
26,  1966;  on  this date at midnight, the British flag in National Park
was lowered and the Guyanese flag was raised, followed by a ceremony  in
Parliament  where  the  Duke  of  Kent  presented  the  Constitutional
Instruments to Prime Minister Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham; and
 
  WHEREAS, From the  very  beginning,  the  Guyanese  have  celebrated
Independence Day with elaborate celebrations such as carnivals, parades,
fireworks, exhibitions, and rallies; and the Guyanese American community
in  New  York  City  celebrates with an Independence Parade, among other
festivities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 140,000 people of Guyanese descent call New York  City
home,  constituting  the second-largest Guyanese population in the world
after the Guyanese capital of  Georgetown,  with  large  communities  in
South  Queens,  Central and Southeast Brooklyn, and the Southeast Bronx;
and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the greatest  testaments  to  the  contributions  of
Guyanese New Yorkers is the neighborhood of Little Guyana, running along
Liberty  Avenue  in  South  Queens,  which  is  home  to  a  bustling
Indo-Guyanese community and numerous restaurants and  small  businesses;
and in 2021, New York City honored the neighborhood by co-naming Liberty
Avenue as "Little Guyana Avenue"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  57th Anniversary of Guyana's Independence provides an
opportunity to recognize the significance of their contributions to  the
 
quality  and  character of life, and, through events and activities, for
all people to gain  a  greater  appreciation  of  Guyanese  history  and
traditions,  and of the role the Guyanese have played, and will continue
to play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 26, 2023, as Guyanese
Independence Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  Guyanese  Consul  General  and  various  Guyanese
organizations in the State of New York.
