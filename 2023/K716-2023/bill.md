  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body that the  quality
and  character of life in this great Empire State is greatly enriched by
the faithful and diligent work of those  organizations  which  serve  to
meet the needs of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  25th anniversary of Rochester Careers in Construction,
Inc., to be celebrated on Thursday, October 19, 2023  at  Monroe  County
Fleet Center Building 11; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rochester  Careers in Construction, Inc. (RCCI) is a local

possibilities that the construction industry provides; through educating
the  community and giving job training to students, RCCI works to enrich
and embolden the community's youth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established  in  1998  by  the  Builders  Exchange,  RCCI's
purpose  was to meet the future workforce needs of industry contractors;
over time, it served to increase participation in local labor unions and
to date, more than 12,000 students have participated in  RCCI's  various
programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Construction encompasses all different types of skills and
crafts and requires  many  different  disciplines,  from  carpentry  and
painting  to  plumbing  and  electrical;  all these crafts exist in many
different areas of the industry:  residential,  commercial,  industrial,
institutional, heavy-highway, roads, bridges, and more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rochester, New York is home to hundreds of contractors that
work  in  all areas of construction and RCCI's mission is to improve the
image of construction as a career choice and to facilitate ways to bring
interested individuals together with education and  employment  training
opportunities,  like  high  school programs, help to find an entry-level
job, or a local apprenticeship program; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Rochester Careers in Construction,  Inc.  is
in  direct  correlation  to the efforts of its Board of Directors, their
partners, Rochester Building & Construction Trades Council,  Multi-Craft
Apprenticeship Preparation Program, Construction Industry Association of
Rochester,  Unions  and  Businesses  United  in  Construction, Workforce
Development Institute, and staff, whose involvement is, and  always  has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful  care  on behalf of improving the quality and dignity of life
 
in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
