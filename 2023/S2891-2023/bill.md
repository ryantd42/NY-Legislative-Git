 Introduced  by  Sens.  MYRIE,  COMRIE, KRUEGER, RIVERA -- read twice and
  ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on
  Codes
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to motions for
  resentencing by the people
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The Legislature finds and declares the following:
  1.  People who commit crimes grow and change over time. The commission
 of a crime--no matter the offense--need not  define  a  person  forever.
 Continued incarceration of people who no longer pose a risk to community
 safety is not in the public interest and only makes our State and socie-
 ty less humane.
  2.  Yet  after  a person is sentenced, we provide few meaningful mech-
 anisms to review the length of that  sentence  based  on  how  a  person
 responds  to  incarceration. We limit these opportunities even though at
 the time of sentencing,  all  involved--including  prosecutors,  judges,
 defense  attorneys, and even the person sentenced--are not positioned to
 determine with any precision how long a sentence needs to be in order to
 fulfill the purpose of incarceration. It is impossible  to  predict  how
 individuals will develop during incarceration.
  3.  The  result  of  this  system is thousands of people still serving
 prison terms despite having long-since been  rehabilitated.  Our  system
 traps  tens  of  thousands of people in New York's prisons who are not a
 safety risk, many for life or de facto life sentences.
  4. Our failure to provide a meaningful opportunity  for  release  also
 traps  a  large  number  of  people  in prison who are serving sentences
 imposed during the tough-on-crime era that we would not impose today.
  5. Our overreliance on lengthy sentences  helped  explode  New  York's
 prison population.

  a.  In  1980,  New  York incarcerated just over 20,000 people. Despite
 recent efforts to reduce the state's  prison  population,  there  remain
 over  45,000  people in our State's prisons, and over 70,000 people when
 jail and prison populations are combined. Even with  recent  reductions,
 New  York's  incarceration  rate remains nearly 2.5-times what it was in
 1980, as the State incarcerates 249 people per 100,000.
  b. Currently, more than 9,000 people in New York prisons are serving a
 life or virtual life sentence. This is the ninth highest  percentage  of
 people in prison serving such sentences in the country.
  c.  Too  many  people  are serving life sentences for crimes committed
 before they even turned twenty years old.
  d. Over a third of people in New York's prisons are serving  sentences
 of  10  years or more; more than 8,500 people have been in prison for at
 least 20 years.
  e. Over 90% of people in prison  in  New  York  are  incarcerated  for
 either  a  first  or  second  felony offense and more than 40% had never
 previously served a jail or prison sentence.
  6. New York's  reliance  on  determinate  sentences  has  particularly
 contributed  to  the increased number of people serving sentences who no
 longer pose a risk to public safety.  A  person  serving  a  determinate
 sentence  in  New  York  must  serve at least 6/7 of the sentence before
 release is possible.
  a. The total number of  people  serving  a  determinate  sentence  has
 tripled since 2001.
  b.  Currently  60%  of  people  in  prison  are  serving a determinate
 sentence.
  c. 98% of all people convicted of a drug crime in New York are serving
 determinate sentences.
  7. Though there have been incremental improvements  in  recent  years,
 New  York's  current  system  of parole provides little relief for those
 facing lengthy sentences who have been rehabilitated. Of the over 12,000
 people who sought release through parole in 2017, more than 7,500 people
 were denied (63%).
  8. Incarcerating people for long periods of time--long after a  person
 presents a risk of danger--takes away tax dollars that could be used for
 health care, housing, education, and infrastructure.
  a.  The  current  average  cost of imprisoning a person in New York is
 $69,000 per year. In contrast, New York spends less than $20,000 a  year
 per student it educates.
  b. The Fiscal Year 2020 executive budget recommended $3.38 billion for
 the  Department  of  Corrections  and  Community  Supervision,  an $84.2
 million increase from the previous fiscal year. New York  State  prisons
 spend  $380.6  million  alone  on health care costs, a 20% increase from
 three years earlier.
  c. The increasing health care costs are  largely  due  to  New  York's
 aging  prison  population. It costs more to incarcerate a person as that
 person ages because of increased health costs, and there are  more  than
 10,000  people  in  our  prisons over the age of 50. And since 1992, the
 number of people age 50 and older incarcerated in New York State prisons
 has steadily increased, while the population of every  other  age  group
 has declined dramatically.
  9.  Lengthy  incarceration  separates families and communities and has
 decimated communities of color.
  a. 61% of all people in prison in New York have at  least  one  child,
 including more than 70% of all women in prison.
 S. 2891  3
 
  b.  People  of  color  are  incarcerated  at disproportionate rates. A
 Latinx person is three times more likely than a white person to be in  a
 New York prison and an African American person is eight times more like-
 ly  than  a  white person to be there.  Though African Americans make up
 18%  of  the state's population, they represent 48.2% of those the state
 incarcerates.
  10. New York's sentencing laws stand out when compared to the rest  of
 the world in terms of their unique cruelty and punitiveness.
  a. It is rare for a European country to have a sentence longer than 20
 years, and many do not have life sentences.
  b. In Latin America, only 6 out of 19 countries allow life sentences.
  c.  Many  countries  allow  for  parole  release,  like Belgium, which
 requires parole review after ten years and Germany after 15.
  d. If New York state were a country, it would have the  fifth  highest
 incarceration rate in the world.
  11.  The actions of District Attorneys have had an oversized impact on
 the growth of prison populations since the 1980s.
  12. The goal of prison is to protect public safety and  promote  reha-
 bilitation. The continued incarceration of those who no longer present a
 serious  risk  to  the  public's  safety  meets  neither of those goals.
 District Attorneys currently have no mechanism to revisit cases from the
 past in which their office recommended sentences  that  today  would  be
 viewed as excessive, or which no longer meet the goals of incarceration.
 District  Attorneys  should be able to move for a modified sentence when
 an incarcerated person has served a substantial amount of time in prison
 on the original sentence, specifically: at least 20 years in prison  for
 an A felony or at least 15 years in prison for any other felony.
  13. Providing District Attorneys with an opportunity to move to reduce
 a  sentence will not risk public safety. Research has consistently shown
 that:
  a. Individuals age out of committing crimes, even those  convicted  of
 the most serious offenses.
  (A)  By  the  time  individuals  reach  their  thirties, their odds of
 committing future crimes drop dramatically. While crime starts  to  peak
 when  a  person  is  in  his or her late teenage years to mid-20s, crime
 drops "sharply" as adults reach their 30s.
  (B) Much of this is due to neurological changes, which take  place  in
 profound  ways  up  until an individual turns 26. The prefrontal cortex,
 which is highly involved in executive functioning and behavior  control,
 continues  to develop until age 26, making it harder for young people to
 make what adults consider logical and appropriate decisions.
  b. Similarly, the odds of recidivism decrease significantly with  age,
 and  a  person's  age--not whether they commit a prior violent crime--is
 the number one predictor of whether a person will  commit  a  new  crime
 once released from prison.
  (A) Released individuals over the age of 50 have a very low recidivism
 rate;  in  New York state, just 5 percent of people released from prison
 aged 50 to 64 return to prison for new offenses; among those aged 65  or
 higher, the rate of new offending is just six-tenths of 1 percent.
  (B)  The  Office  of Inspector General of the US Department of Justice
 has found that older people  in  prison  commit  less  misconduct  while
 incarcerated  and  have a lower rate of re-arrest once released, and has
 recommended the early release of older people in prison to  help  manage
 the inmate population and reduce costs at the Bureau of Prisons.
  (C)  Several  studies,  state  policies and programs, and the National
 Institute of Corrections of the Bureau of Prisons, consider incarcerated
 S. 2891  4
 
 individuals aged 50 and above to be elderly because incarcerated  people
 age at an accelerated rate. They are more likely than the general public
 to  experience  stresses like long histories of alcohol and drug misuse,
 insufficient diet, lack of medical care, financial struggles, and stress
 of maintaining safety while behind bars.
  c. Decreasing sentences does not increase crime.
  (A)  Between  1996 and 2016, New York city reduced its jail and prison
 population by 55% while also reducing its violent crime by 58%.
  (B) A recent Brennan Center for Justice report documented  34  states,
 including  New York, that reduced both their prison population and their
 crime rates.
  (C) The Sentencing Project concluded that  lengthy  prison  terms  are
 counterproductive for public safety.
  (D)  The  Justice  Policy  Institute  found  little  to no correlation
 between time spent in prison and recidivism rates.
  14. A District Attorney's ethical obligation is  not  just  to  secure
 convictions and sentences, but to do justice. This act will allow DAs to
 fulfill  this ethical obligation by moving to reduce sentences where the
 interest of justice demands it.
  15. This act does not relieve people of the consequences  of  criminal
 conduct; rather, it provides a District Attorney with the opportunity to
 seek  a  reduced  sentence and allows a judge to make the decision after
 reviewing all current and relevant information. This act will help  make
 our policies consistent with the reality that many--though certainly not
 all--people  that  we  incarcerate  have  since grown, changed, and been
 rehabilitated to the point where continued incarceration  no  longer  is
 required to protect the public.
  §  2.  The  criminal  procedure law is amended by adding a new section
 440.48 to read as follows:
 § 440.48 MOTION FOR RESENTENCE; BY THE PEOPLE.
  1. WHERE A DEFENDANT IS SERVING A  SENTENCE  OF  INCARCERATION  FOR  A
 DETERMINATE  OR  INDETERMINATE SENTENCE, THE COURT IN WHICH THE JUDGMENT
 WAS ENTERED, UPON MOTION OF THE PEOPLE, MAY SET ASIDE THE  SENTENCE  AND
 RESENTENCE  THE  DEFENDANT  IF  SUCH  RESENTENCING IS IN THE INTEREST OF
 JUSTICE.
  2. THE PEOPLE MAY MAKE A MOTION FOR RESENTENCE AFTER A  DEFENDANT  HAS
 SERVED  AT  LEAST TWENTY YEARS OF A SENTENCE FOR A CLASS A FELONY, OR AT
 LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS OF ANY OTHER SENTENCE, INCLUDING A SENTENCE RECEIVED
 FOLLOWING A GUILTY PLEA. THE MOTION SHALL BE MADE UPON REASONABLE NOTICE
 TO THE DEFENDANT AND TO THE ATTORNEY IF ANY WHO APPEARED FOR HIM OR  HER
 IN THE LAST PROCEEDING WHICH OCCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE JUDGMENT OR
 SENTENCE.
  3.  THE  MODIFIED  SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE COURT SHALL NOT REQUIRE THE
 DEFENDANT TO SERVE MORE THAN THE REMAINDER OF THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE  AND
 MAY  BE  BELOW  THE STATUTORY MANDATORY MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT FOR
 THE OFFENSE. IN CALCULATING THE MODIFIED SENTENCE TO BE  SERVED  BY  THE
 DEFENDANT,  SUCH  DEFENDANT  MAY  BE CREDITED FOR ANY JAIL TIME CREDITED
 TOWARDS THE SUBJECT CONVICTION AS WELL AS ANY  PERIOD  OF  INCARCERATION
 CREDITED TOWARD THE SENTENCE ORIGINALLY IMPOSED.
  4.  THE  COURT  SHALL  GIVE  NOTICE  OF  ANY  SENTENCE-MODIFICATION
 PROCEEDINGS TO VICTIMS OR THE FAMILY OF THE  VICTIMS,  IF  THEY  CAN  BE
 LOCATED  WITH REASONABLE EFFORTS. VICTIMS AND VICTIMS' FAMILIES SHALL BE
 AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.
  5. IN CONSIDERING AN APPLICATION MADE PURSUANT TO  THIS  SECTION,  THE
 COURT  SHALL  CONSIDER  ANY  FACTS  OR CIRCUMSTANCES RELEVANT TO WHETHER
 S. 2891  5
 
 RESENTENCING THE DEFENDANT WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE,  INCLUD-
 ING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
  (A)  WHETHER  THE  DEFENDANT  CAN BE RETURNED SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
  (I) WHETHER THERE IS A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT  IF  RELEASED,  THE
 DEFENDANT WILL LIVE AND REMAIN AT LIBERTY WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAW; OR
  (II)  EVIDENCE  THAT  REFLECTS  WHETHER AGE, AMOUNT OF TIME SERVED, OR
 DIMINISHED PHYSICAL CONDITION  OR  HEALTH,  IF  ANY,  HAVE  REDUCED  THE
 DEFENDANT'S RISK FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE;
  (B) THE DEFENDANT'S DISCIPLINARY RECORD WHILE INCARCERATED;
  (C)  ANY  MEASURES THE DEFENDANT HAS TAKEN TOWARD REHABILITATION, SUCH
 AS THE DEFENDANT'S RECORD OF PARTICIPATION OR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE
 IN PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT WHILE INCARCERATED;
  (D) THE AGE OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE NUMBER OF YEARS  HE  OR  SHE  HAS
 ALREADY SERVED OF THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE;
  (E)  ANY  VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL SENTENCING AND ANY
 SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT MADE TO THE COURT BY THE VICTIM OR  THE  VICTIM'S
 FAMILY PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION;
  (F)  THE  RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION AND COMMUNITY
 SUPERVISION; AND
  (G) EVIDENCE THAT REFLECTS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED  SINCE  THE
 DEFENDANT'S ORIGINAL SENTENCING SO THAT THE DEFENDANT'S CONTINUED INCAR-
 CERATION IS NO LONGER IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
