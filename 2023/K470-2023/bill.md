  memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
  May 4-10, 2023, as Late Onset Hearing Loss Awareness
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official weeks that are set aside to increase awareness of health issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 4-10, 2023, as Late
Onset Hearing  Loss  Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National Late Onset Hearing Loss
Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Late onset hearing loss, defined as hearing loss  occurring
after  birth  and  before  Kindergarten,  often  goes  undiagnosed  and
untreated in childhood due to lack of awareness and infrequency of early
childhood hearing screenings; and
 
  WHEREAS, Late onset hearing loss may develop in  infants,  toddlers,
and  young  children who have already passed a newborn hearing screening
test; a hearing screening at birth may fail to detect mild hearing  loss
or the onset of hearing loss may not occur until after infancy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The factors causing late onset hearing loss are varied and
include  genetic  causes,  childhood  syndromes,  congenital  illness,
infections,  exposure to ototoxic medications, head trauma, and exposure
to excessive noise; however, the cause of late onset hearing loss is not
always known; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hearing plays a vital role in  childhood  development,  and
undetected  late  onset hearing loss could lead to developmental delays,
speech and language difficulties, and social and emotional distress that
can only be addressed once hearing loss is diagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  associated  decrease  in
in-person  education,  medical  treatment, and other social interactions
have increased the likelihood that  late  onset  hearing  loss  will  go
undetected for longer in many children; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important to quickly diagnose late onset hearing loss
so  that  appropriate  developmental management can be provided, hearing
loss progression can be monitored, and amplification  and  communication
options  can  be  reviewed  by  a  child's  family,  caretakers,  and
professionals who support the child; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awareness of late onset hearing  loss  will  help  parents,
families,  guardians,  teachers, child-care providers, and pediatricians
to discuss and assess  a  child's  developmental  milestones,  regularly
monitor  hearing  health  and  seek hearing evaluations, and learn about
resources, treatment, and intervention services to address the needs and
 
improve the lives  of  children  with  late  onset  hearing  loss;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 4-10,  2023,  as  Late
Onset Hearing Loss Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
