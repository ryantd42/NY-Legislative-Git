  Except  as  otherwise provided in subdivision two of this section, any
 moneys in the general fund of the state or moneys received from the sale
 of any bonds or notes issued by the state, any moneys  in  any  fund  or
 account  of  the state, heretofore or hereafter established, the invest-
 ment of which is not otherwise authorized and which are not  immediately
 required  may  be  invested  by  the  comptroller.  Such moneys may be
 invested only in obligations of the categories specified in subdivisions

 teen,  as  added by chapters seven hundred ninety-seven and nine hundred
 thirty-two of the laws of nineteen  hundred  sixty-three,  respectively,

 this article, maturing or redeemable at the option of the holder  within
 twelve  years  of the date of such investment, subdivisions two-a, eigh-
 teen, nineteen and twenty of section ninety-eight of this article or  in
 a  certificate  of deposit of a bank [or], trust company OR CREDIT UNION
 in this state. Any certificate of deposit shall be fully secured by  the
 issuer  thereof  depositing with the comptroller stocks, bonds, or notes
 of any county, town, city, village, fire district or school district  of
 this  state  issued  pursuant to law and maturing within five years from
 the date of issuance of such certificate of deposit, bonds or  notes  or

 icate  of deposit. Any bonds, notes or certificates of deposit purchased

 lawful  appropriation  in  force.  Any  bonds,  notes or certificates of
 S. 6355  3
 
 deposit purchased with moneys received from the sale  of  any  bonds  or
 notes  issued by the state shall be available always for the purposes or
 purpose for which such bonds or notes were issued.  Any bonds, notes  or
 certificates  of  deposit purchased with moneys of any other funds shall
 be available always for the purpose for which  such  fund  was  created.
 Unless otherwise required by law, income received on any moneys invested
 pursuant  to  this  section  shall be credited to the fund or funds from
 which such moneys were invested, provided, however, the  comptroller  is
 hereby  precluded  from  crediting  interest  earnings to funds/accounts
 which:
  § 4. Subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 105 of  the  state  finance  law,
 subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 204 of the laws of 2002, subdivision

  1. All moneys received by the commissioner of taxation and finance  on
 account of the state, excepting such moneys as are required by law to be
 deposited to the credit of the comptroller, but including such moneys as
 are thereafter paid into the state treasury by the comptroller, shall be
 deposited  by the commissioner of taxation and finance within three days
 after the receipt thereof, either as a demand deposit  or  an  interest-
 bearing  time  deposit (other than a time certificate of deposit), as he
 and the comptroller may determine, in such banks, trust companies [and],
 industrial banks AND CREDIT UNIONS as in his opinion and the opinion  of
 the  comptroller  are secure. The moneys so deposited shall be placed to
 the account of the commissioner of taxation and finance. He shall keep a
 bankbook in which shall be entered his account of deposit in and  moneys
 drawn  from  the  banks  and trust companies [and], industrial banks AND
 CREDIT UNIONS in which deposits are made by him, which he shall  exhibit
 to  the  comptroller  for  his  inspection on the first Tuesday of every
 month and oftener if required. He shall not draw any  moneys  from  such
 banks, trust companies [or], industrial banks OR CREDIT UNIONS unless by
 checks  signed and countersigned in the manner prescribed by section one
 hundred one, unless otherwise provided by law. No moneys shall  be  paid
 by  any  such  bank, trust company [or], industrial bank OR CREDIT UNION
 out of any such deposit except upon such checks.  Moneys  may  be  paid
 through  electronic  transfer in accordance with procedures developed by
 the commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  and  the  comptroller  and
 consistent with the requirements of this section for recording payments.
 Such  payments  through  electronic  transfer  shall  be considered, for
 purposes of this chapter, to be moneys drawn by check.  Every such bank,
 trust company [or], industrial bank OR CREDIT UNION  shall  transmit  to
 the comptroller monthly statements of all moneys received and paid by it
 on account of the commissioner of taxation and finance.
  2.  Every  bank, trust company [and], industrial bank AND CREDIT UNION

 section shall, before deposits are made:

 bond to the state in such form and with such surety or sureties for such
 sums as may be prescribed and approved by the commissioner  of  taxation
 and  finance  and comptroller, for the safekeeping and prompt payment of
 such moneys on legal demand therefor with interest, if any; or
  b. In lieu of such surety bond, with the permission of the comptroller
 and the commissioner of taxation and finance,  deposit  with  the  comp-
 troller outstanding unmatured:
