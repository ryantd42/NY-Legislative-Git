  COMMEMORATING the 350th Anniversary of the Town of
  Coeymans on April 7, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  350th  Anniversary  of  the Town of Coeymans in Albany
County, New York, to be celebrated with a myriad of events on Friday and
Saturday, June 9 & 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town  of  Coeymans  was  named  after  Barent  Pieteres
Koijemans  who  arrived  in  New  York from Holland in 1639; on April 7,
1673, he officially took possession of the land he purchased from Native
Americans in 1672, land which became known as the Coeymans Patent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The land from the Coeymans  Patent  was  approximately  120
square miles, located along the Hudson River, spanning from Bethlehem to
Coxsackie, inclusive of the modern towns of Coeymans, New Baltimore, and
Westerlo; and
 
  WHEREAS, It was in this area which Barent Pieteres Koijemans erected
his  home  which  is  known as the Coeymans Castle, along with two grist
mills and two sawmills, all located  along  the  Coeymans  Creek;  these
mills  were  the  catalyst  for  the  area's  flourishing commercial and
industrial river port, making the Town of Coeymans well known  to  river
travelers for many centuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Revolutionary  War,  starting  in  1776,  was another
contributing factor to the rapid growth of local  industries;  the  need
for ship building grew drastically, with local sawmills supplying lumber
for the construction of ships such as gunboats and gundelos; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  the  war,  the  Hudson River Valley area became
rapidly settled; the prosperous river port known as Coeymans Landing was
the  earliest  settlement  which  quickly  became  instrumental  in  the
commercial  trading  of  goods such as spices, molasses, tobacco, cloth,
clothing, rice, brandy, spirits, and local produce; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first recorded Town meeting was held in April of  1811,
and the first Supervisor was elected in 1818; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Commerce  continued to grow following the close of the War
of 1812, and continued to grow through the turn  of  the  century;  ship
building  and  ice harvesting were prominent industries, alongside brick
manufacturing, Mossy Hill Stone Quarry, and the variety of  grist,  saw,
and  water  mills  which  were  built  along the Hannacroix Creek and in
modern day Alcove; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stage companies established routes and were given contracts
for carrying mail around 1820; prior to this  time,  mail  had  commonly
been carried by Post Riders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  turnpike  company was incorporated for the construction
and maintenance of a highway  from  Coeymans  Landing  through  Coeymans
Hollow,  Indian  Fields,  Dormansville,  and  Westerlo,  to the Delaware
Turnpike, ranging a total of approximately 18 miles; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first newspaper in the area was published in  1863;  in
1907,  the  Ravena  News  bought  the Coeymans Herald to become the News
Herald, with F. E. Bleezarde becoming the owner in 1917; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coeymans was first connected  to  Albany  in  1864  by  the
Saratoga  and  Hudson  River  Railroad,  however,  this  railroad  was
short-lived, and the Town went without a railroad until 1883,  when  the
New York West Shore Buffalo Line was completed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  completion  of  the  latter  railroad, Coeymans
Square, which later became known as Coeymans Junction, and lastly called
Ravena, truly thrived; and
 
  WHEREAS, Waterworks systems were constructed in the  Town  in  1897,
telephone  services  were  added  in 1903, electric lights were added in
1908, Ravena was incorporated into a  village  in  1914,  and  a  sewage
system was installed in 1915; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rich  in  history,  the  Fletcher  Blaisdell Farm Complex,
Coeymans School, Ariaanje Coeymans House, Coeymans-Bronck  Stone  House,
Mull House and Cemetery, Tobias Ten Eyck House and Cemeteries, Cornelius
and  Agnietje  Van  Derzee House, Little Red Schoolhouse Museum, and the
Electus Shear house are all listed on the National Register of  Historic
Places; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Present  day  Coeymans  is  home to a population of around
7,200 citizens, sitting just 15 miles south of the City of  Albany,  the
New  York  State  capital  in the Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk Central School
District; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many events and activities take place to celebrate life  in
the  Town  of  Coeymans;  notably,  the  occasions  of  Riverfest,  the
Friendship Festival, and the  We  Love  aRtCS  Music  and  Art  Festival
provide  opportunities for the community at large to socialize, educate,
learn, eat, dance, and marvel at the artistic and musical talents within
the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 350th Anniversary of  the  Town  of  Coeymans  will  be
celebrated  on Friday and Saturday, June 9 & 10, 2023, at Joralemon Park
and Coeymans Landing; these days will be host to food, vendors, parades,
rides, local live music, and a memorable display of fireworks  to  close
the night; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  fruitful  over  the  ebb and flow of decades of
growth and change, the Town of  Coeymans  continues  its  commitment  to
enhancing  the  quality  of  life  of  its citizens, ensuring a positive
business, institutional, and educational climate, as well  as  providing
all  essential  services for its citizenry to thrive; now, therefore, be
it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 350th Anniversary of the Town of Coeymans  on  April  7,
2023,  recognizing  the significance of the role it continues to play in
the life of the community of the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Town of Coeymans.
