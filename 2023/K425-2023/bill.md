  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  26,  2023,  as  Heat
Awareness  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of National Heat Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Heat Awareness Day is observed each  year  on  the
last  Friday  in  May  to  highlight  the  numerous  health problems and
fatalities caused each year by exposure to excessive heat,  one  of  the
leading weather-related killers in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over the years, massive temperature rises have resulted in
a multitude of deaths including the over 600 people who died  in  Oregon
and Washington over one week in June 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, The number of heat-related fatalities has risen in the last
30 years due to higher temperatures from climate change; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tim  Barber,  a healthy 35-year old, died from heat stress
and heat exhaustion on his second day working on a construction  jobsite
in  Geneseo  on a sweltering afternoon in July 2020 with temperatures in
the mid-90s; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Weather Service issues a number of  advisories
during  times  of  high  temperatures including Excessive Heat Outlooks,
Excessive Heat Watches, and Excessive Heat Warnings/Advisories; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heat-related illnesses are  preventable;  New  Yorkers  can
take  such  precautions  as  staying  hydrated  and avoiding alcohol and
caffeinated drinks, as well as avoiding over-exertion and finding a cool
place to stay indoors; furthermore, employers should  accommodate  these
precautions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
important issue, and more must be  done  to  increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  26,  2023,  as  Heat
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the family of Tim Barber.
