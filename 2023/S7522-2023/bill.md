 AN  ACT  to amend the public buildings law and the state finance law, in

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 public buildings law, as amended by section 1 of part N of chapter 55 of
 the laws of 2015, is amended to read as follows:
  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provisions of law, the commissioner

 having custody of any public building full responsibility for the prepa-
 ration of plans and specifications and the supervision of minor, routine
 or  uncomplicated  construction, reconstruction, alteration, improvement

 ation or repair of any state building may  be  done  by  special  order.

 dollars and a bond shall not be required for  special  orders.  No  work

 selecting the  contractor  to  perform  the  work.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions  of  subdivision  two  of section eight of this chapter, work
 done by special order  under  this  section  may  be  advertised  solely
 through the regular public notification service of the office of general
 services.  At least five days shall elapse between the first publication
 of such public notice and the date so specified for the  public  opening
 of bids. All payments on special orders shall be made on the certificate
 of  the commissioner of general services and audited and approved by the
 state comptroller. All special orders shall contain a  clause  that  the
 special order shall only be deemed executory to the extent of the moneys
 available  and  no  liability  shall be incurred by the state beyond the
 moneys available for the purpose.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 137 of the state finance law,  as  sepa-
 rately amended by section 17 of part MM of chapter 57 and chapter 619 of
 the laws of 2008, is amended to read as follows:
  1. In addition to other bond or bonds, if any, required by law for the
 completion  of  a  work specified in a contract for the prosecution of a
 public improvement for the state of New York a municipal corporation,  a
 public benefit corporation or a commission appointed pursuant to law, or
 in the absence of any such requirement, the comptroller may or the other
 appropriate  official, respectively, shall nevertheless require prior to
 the approval of any such contract a bond guaranteeing prompt payment  of
 moneys  due to all persons furnishing labor or materials to the contrac-
 tor or any subcontractors in the prosecution of the work provided for in
 such contract. Whenever a municipal corporation issues a permit  subject
 to  compliance  with  section  two hundred twenty of the labor law, such
 permittee or its contractor or subcontractors furnishing  workers  shall
 post a payment bond subject to this section. Provided, however, that all
 performance  bonds  and payment bonds may, at the discretion of the head
 of the state agency, public benefit corporation or commission, or his or
 her designee, be dispensed with for the completion of a  work  specified
 in  a contract for the prosecution of a public improvement for the state
 of New York for which bids are solicited [where the aggregate amount  of
 the contract is under one hundred thousand dollars and provided further,
 that  in a case where], FOR ALL CONTRACTS, WHETHER the contract is OR IS
 not subject to the multiple contract award requirements of  section  one
 hundred  thirty-five of this article, such requirements may be dispensed
 with where the head of the state agency, public benefit  corporation  or
 commission finds it to be in the public interest and where the aggregate
 amount of the contract awarded or to be awarded is less than two hundred
 thousand  dollars.  Provided further, that in a case where a performance
 or payment bond is dispensed with, twenty per  centum  may  be  retained
 from  each  progress  payment or estimate until the entire contract work
 has been completed and accepted, at which time the  head  of  the  state
 agency,  public  benefit  corporation  or  commission shall, pending the
 payment of the final estimate, pay not to exceed seventy-five per centum
 of the amount of the retained percentage.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
