 AN ACT to amend the  general  business  law  and  the  banking  law,  in
  relation  to  prohibiting  a  consumer reporting agency or lender from
  using an individual's late payment of cashless tolls to determine such
  individual's credit worthiness
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraphs (vii) and (viii) of paragraph 1 of subdivi-
 sion (f) of section 380-j of the general business law, as added by chap-
 ter 867 of the laws of 1977, are amended to read as follows:
  (vii) information relating to past confinement in a mental institution
 where the date of last confinement antedates the  report  by  more  than
 seven years; [or]
  (viii) LATE PAYMENTS OF ANY CASHLESS TOLLS; OR
  (IX)  any other adverse information which antedates the report by more
 than seven years.
  § 2. Section 352 of the banking law is amended by adding a  new  ninth
 undesignated paragraph to read as follows:
  NO LICENSEE SHALL COLLECT, EVALUATE, REPORT OR MAINTAIN IN THE FILE ON
 A  BORROWER THE BORROWER'S LATE PAYMENT OF CASHLESS TOLLS AS A FACTOR TO
 DETERMINE THE BORROWER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS, CREDIT  STANDING  OR  CREDIT
 CAPACITY.  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL  ENSURE  THAT THE CREDIT SCORING
 FORMULAS FILED WITH  THE  DEPARTMENT  DO  NOT  CONTAIN  VARIABLES  WHICH
 ACCOUNT  FOR  LATE  PAYMENT OF CASHLESS TOLLS AS PART OF THAT FORMULA BY
 ASKING THE LICENSEE TO CERTIFY TO THAT FACT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
