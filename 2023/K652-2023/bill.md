  WHEREAS, Dr. Alan S. Chartock founded and became  the  publisher  of
the Legislative Gazette in 1978, which provided detailed coverage of New

citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1981,  Dr.  Alan  S.  Chartock's  leadership  has

analysis of current events and  conversations  with  prominent  leaders,
including several New York State Governors; and

film  presentations  and  other  programming  of  value to the listening
community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
