  COMMEMORATING  the 245th Anniversary of the Battle
  of Oriskany on August 6, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commemorate  events  which  evoke  the  historical,  social and cultural
development of this great State,  and  pay  tribute  to  the  memory  of
individuals  of  remarkable  courage  and  strength  of character, whose
purposeful lives embodied the spirit of the principles upon  which  this
Nation was founded; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  245th  Anniversary  of  the  Battle  of Oriskany; this
momentous occasion will  be  held  on  Saturday,  August  6,  2022,  and
includes  a re-enactment of the militia march, a musket salute in memory
of the fallen, and a presentation of wreaths and  ceremonial  offerings,
as well as guest speakers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Considered  to  be  a  significant  turning  point  in the
Revolutionary War, the Battle of Oriskany, fought on August 6, 1777, has
been described as one of its bloodiest battles; and
 
  WHEREAS, While the British were attacking Fort Stanwix in August  of
1777,  Brigadier  General  Nicholas  Herkimer  assembled 800 militiamen,
supported by 60 allied Oneida warriors, and marched from Fort Dayton  to
aid against the siege; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  hearing  of Herkimer's advance, British and Loyalist
troops under Sir John  Johnson  and  Colonel  John  Butler,  and  Native
American forces led by Mohawk Joseph Brant, ambushed the American troops
in a ravine west of Oriskany Creek; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  patriots  fought  in  brutal hand-to-hand combat, and
despite  heavy  losses,  caused  their  opponents  to  retreat;  General
Herkimer  received  a  wound  to  his leg which led to his death 10 days
later; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Oneidas were the only Haudenosaunee nation to side with
the Americans and it is that famous battle that cemented their legacy as
America's First Allies; and
 
  WHEREAS, A monument was dedicated on August 6, 1884, to serve  as  a
memorial  to  those  who  fought  so bravely and tenaciously to preserve
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, Oriskany Battlefield was designated a New York
State Historic Site in 1927; in recognition of  the  site's  exceptional
historic  value,  the  battlefield  was  designated  a National Historic
Landmark in 1963; and
 
  WHEREAS, As our State and Nation observe this 245th Anniversary,  we
reflect with solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served
with  honor,  and  pay tribute to the selfless and courageous militiamen
 
for their tremendous sacrifices made for our Nation and for the  benefit
of all Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 245th Anniversary of the Battle of Oriskany on August 6,
2022; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site, Oriskany, New
York.
