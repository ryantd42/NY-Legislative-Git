  COMMEMORATING the 53rd Anniversary of Earth Day on
  April 22, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  and  persons  dedicating  their
purposeful work to increasing public awareness of, and appreciation for,
the  natural  resources  of  New York, recognizing the role all citizens
have in protecting the environment and  the  quality  of  life  in  this
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Responding to widespread environmental degradation, Gaylord
Nelson,  a  United  States  Senator  from  Wisconsin,  called  for  an
environmental teach-in, or Earth Day, to be held on April 22, 1970; over
20 million people participated that year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Earth Day is now observed each year on  April  22  by  more
than 500 million people and national governments in 175 countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the 53 years that have passed since the original Earth
Day, the planet has been subjected to the continuing  burdens  of  world
population  growth,  increasing  commercial and residential development,
ocean pollution, increasing stores of toxic and nuclear waste, and other
similar assaults which have exacerbated the growing  dangers  of  global
climate change, ozone depletion, toxic poisoning, deforestation and mass
species extinctions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  the  first Earth Day, and the demonstrations of
concern of over 20 million Americans, a collective national  action  has
resulted  in  the passage of sweeping new laws to protect the invaluable
resources of air, land and water; and
 
  WHEREAS, A sound natural environment is the foundation of a  healthy
society  and  a  robust  economy  in that it works hand in hand with the
creation of green jobs, boosts sustainable  agriculture  in  communities
and  allows  for  New  Yorkers to take in the natural elements that have
defined our State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Human  activities  around  the  world  are  causing  severe
environmental  damage  that  threatens  human  health  and  our planet's
ability to  sustain  a  diverse  community  of  life  such  as  a  heavy
dependence  on  fossil  fuels, widespread use of toxic chemicals in food
and other consumer goods, devastation of  forests,  hazardous  chemicals
that  have  affected  children  and  families  in our many environmental
justice communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  knowledge  of  ways  to  live  in  harmony  with  our
environment  and methods and technologies to accomplish this end already
exists in the pristine natural resources that  New  York  State  has  to
offer  for sustainable communities in rich agriculture, clean waters and
a movement that promotes reliance  on  renewable  energy  resources  and
recycling; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Local  communities  can  do  much to reverse environmental
degradation and contribute to building a healthy  society  by  promoting
energy  conservation, sustainable land use policies, and public transit;
and
 
  WHEREAS, There are sound economic, environmental, and social reasons
for local governments to initiate energy efficiency and renewable energy
practices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  environmental realities of our time require humans to
make a dramatic shift in our relationship to the earth; and
 
  WHEREAS, April 22, 2023, marks the 53rd Anniversary of Earth Day,  a
day  set aside to celebrate the beauty and bounty of our environment and
to revitalize the efforts required to protect, and maintain respect for,
the environment and its resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, Earth Day 2023  activities  and  events  will  educate  all
citizens  on  the  importance  of acting in an environmentally sensitive
fashion by recycling,  conserving  energy  and  water,  using  efficient
transportation, and adopting more ecologically sound lifestyles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  goal of Earth Day 2023 is not to plan only one day of
events and activities, but to continue worldwide efforts to protect  all
aspects of the environment; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 53rd Anniversary of Earth Day on April 22, 2023; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  New York commits itself to undertaking programs and
projects that enhance our community's natural  environment;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  New  York  State  hereby  encourages its residents,
businesses and institutions to use Earth Day to celebrate the Earth  and
commit to building a sustainable society; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body congratulate all the concerned
citizens of New York State who have embraced  the  responsible  work  of
protecting and preserving the environment for future generations.
