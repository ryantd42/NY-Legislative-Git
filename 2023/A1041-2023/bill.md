 Introduced  by  M. of A. PEOPLES-STOKES -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT to amend the real property tax law, in relation  to  providing  a
  tax abatement related to the removal of leaded paint
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The real property tax  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 467-m to read as follows:
  §  467-M.  ABATEMENT OF REAL PROPERTY TAXES FOR THE COST OF LEAD-BASED
 PAINT REMEDIATION TO CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL RENTAL BUILDINGS.  1.  RESIDEN-
 TIAL  RENTAL  BUILDINGS  WHERE LEAD-BASED PAINT REMEDIATION IS COMPLETED
 SUBSEQUENT TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A LOCAL LAW  OR  RESOLUTION  ADOPTED
 PURSUANT  TO THIS SECTION SHALL RECEIVE A REAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT TO
 THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. AFTER A PUBLIC HEARING, THE GOVERN-
 ING BOARD OF A CITY MAY ADOPT A LOCAL LAW TO GRANT THE ABATEMENT AUTHOR-
 IZED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. A COPY OF SUCH LOCAL  LAW  OR  RESOLUTION
 SHALL BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND THE ASSESSOR OF SUCH CITY.
  2. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:
  A.  "LEAD-BASED  PAINT  REMEDIATION"  SHALL  MEAN  ANY SET OF MEASURES
 DESIGNED TO PERMANENTLY ELIMINATE LEAD-BASED PAINT OR  LEAD-BASED  PAINT
 HAZARDS.  REMEDIATION INCLUDES: (I) THE REMOVAL OF LEAD-BASED PAINT AND
 DUST LEAD HAZARDS, THE PERMANENT ENCLOSURE  OR  ENCAPSULATION  OF  LEAD-
 BASED  PAINT,  THE  REPLACEMENT  OF  COMPONENTS OR FIXTURES PAINTED WITH
 LEAD-BASED PAINT, AND THE REMOVAL OR  PERMANENT  COVERING  OF  SOIL-LEAD
 HAZARDS;  AND (II) ALL PREPARATION, CLEANUP, DISPOSAL AND POST ABATEMENT
 CLEARANCE TESTING ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MEASURES. REMEDIATION  SHALL  NOT
 INCLUDE  RENOVATION,  REMODELING,  LANDSCAPING OR OTHER ACTIVITIES, WHEN
 SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT DESIGNED  TO  PERMANENTLY  ELIMINATE  LEAD-BASED
 PAINT HAZARDS, BUT, INSTEAD, ARE DESIGNED TO REPAIR, RESTORE, OR REMODEL
 A  GIVEN  STRUCTURE  OR DWELLING, EVEN THOUGH THESE ACTIVITIES MAY INCI-
 DENTALLY RESULT IN  A  REDUCTION  OR  ELIMINATION  OF  LEAD-BASED  PAINT

 HAZARDS.  FURTHERMORE,  REMEDIATION  DOES  NOT INCLUDE INTERIM CONTROLS,
 OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER MEASURES AND  ACTIVITIES
 DESIGNED  TO  TEMPORARILY,  BUT NOT PERMANENTLY, REDUCE LEAD-BASED PAINT
 HAZARDS.
  B.  "ASSESSOR"  SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION
 THREE OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWO OF THIS CHAPTER, PROVIDED THAT THE CITY
 MAY DESIGNATE AN AGENCY OR PERSON TO EXERCISE THE FUNCTIONS, POWERS  AND
 DUTIES TASKED TO THE ASSESSOR PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  C.  "RESIDENTIAL  RENTAL  BUILDING"  SHALL MEAN A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING
 WITH THREE OR MORE DWELLING UNITS, OTHER THAN A HOTEL, WHICH  IS  EITHER

 HOME OF THREE OR MORE FAMILIES LIVING INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER.

 INCURRED  TO  SAFELY  REMOVE LEADED PAINT FROM INTERIOR SURFACES, WINDOW
 SILLS, WINDOW FRAMES OR PORCHES.

 AN  AMOUNT  EQUAL  TO  THE  COST  OF  THE  LEAD-BASED PAINT REMEDIATION,
 PROVIDED THAT THE GOVERNING BODY  OF  THE  CITY  MAY  ESTABLISH  MAXIMUM
 DOLLAR  LIMITS  FOR SPECIFIED ITEMS OF COST THROUGH ITS LOCAL LAW. ADDI-
 TIONALLY, SUCH GOVERNING BODY MAY ESTABLISH A  MAXIMUM  TOTAL  ABATEMENT
 AMOUNT GRANTED PER RESIDENTIAL RENTAL BUILDING.
  B.  THE  ABATEMENT  SHALL  BE PAID OVER A MAXIMUM PERIOD OF TWO YEARS,
 PROVIDED THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING PARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE  TAX
 ABATEMENT  SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TAX LIABILITY FOR THE RESIDENTIAL RENTAL
 BUILDING IN THE TAX YEAR IN WHICH THE TAX ABATEMENT IS TAKEN.
  C. NO SUCH ABATEMENT SHALL BE GRANTED FOR THE LEAD-BASED PAINT REMEDI-
 ATION UNLESS:
  (I) THE LEAD-BASED  PAINT  REMEDIATION  COMMENCED  SUBSEQUENT  TO  THE
 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE LOCAL LAW OR RESOLUTION ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SUBDI-
 VISION ONE OF THIS SECTION;
  (II)  THE  LEAD-BASED  PAINT  REMEDIATION  WAS  PERFORMED BY FIRMS AND

 WITH REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE UNITED  STATES  ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION
 AGENCY  AT  SUBPART  L  OF  40 C.F.R. PART 745 FOR THE ABATEMENT OF LEAD
 HAZARDS; AND
  (III) THE RESIDENTIAL RENTAL BUILDING DOES  NOT  HAVE  ANY  DELINQUENT
 CITY  TAXES  AS OF THE TAXABLE STATUS DATE APPLICABLE TO THE TAX ROLL ON
 WHICH AN ABATEMENT IS APPLIED, OR AS OF SUCH LATER DATE AS SPECIFIED  BY
 LOCAL LAW.
  4.  SUCH ABATEMENT SHALL BE GRANTED ONLY UPON APPLICATION BY THE OWNER
 OF SUCH BUILDING ON A FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSIONER. THE  APPLICA-
 TION  SHALL BE FILED WITH THE ASSESSOR OF THE CITY, BEFORE THE APPROPRI-
 ATE TAXABLE STATUS DATE  OF  SUCH  CITY  AND  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR  OF  THE
 COMPLETION  OF  THE  LEAD PAINT REMEDIATION. SUCH APPLICATION SHALL AT A
 MINIMUM INCLUDE:
