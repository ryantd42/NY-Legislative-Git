  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 25 - July 1, 2023, as Helen  Keller  Deaf-Blind
  Awareness Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
celebrate a week that is set aside to promote and raise public awareness
and attention concerning deaf-blindness and highlight the  contributions
of those who have this disability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 25 - July 1, 2023, as
Helen  Keller  Deaf-Blind  Awareness  Week  in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance  of  National  Helen  Keller  Deaf-Blind
Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Deaf-blindness  is  one  of  the  most  severe  of  all
disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1984, President Reagan declared the last week of June as
Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week, which was an action enforced  as
a result of a joint Senate and House resolution; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Helen  Keller  is  the  most  accomplished,  respected and
renowned American who was deaf-blind; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born June 27, 1880, and died June  1,  1968,  Helen  Keller
made  a  significant  impact  in the month of June, with the way she has
lived her life as a  deaf  and  blind  author,  political  activist  and
lecturer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  she  was born with both vision and sound senses,
she lost her ability to see and hear at the tender age of 19 months  due
to an illness which was possibly meningitis or scarlet fever; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is in the interest of the State of New York to prevent
the waste of human resources by encouraging the  full  participation  of
Americans  with  severe  multisensory  disabilities  in  our  economy by
fostering employment, housing and recreational options  for  people  who
are  deaf-blind,  thus  maximizing  their opportunities for a productive
life in the community of their choice; and
 
  WHEREAS, Independent living means an ability  to  function  smoothly
and  easily  within  the structure of society, being able to communicate
with others to obtain useful  information,  travel  freely  and  without
fear, and have the ability to perform chores and work that are necessary
for survival; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is highly appropriate to publicize the needs, abilities
and potential  of  our  fellow  citizens  who  are  deaf-blind,  and  to
recognize  Helen  Keller  as  a  guiding  example  of  courage,  hope,
determination and achievement for other individuals who are  deaf-blind;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week is an opportunity to
urge  and  encourage the residents of New York to support programs which
have the objective to empower and educate  people  from  the  deaf-blind
community of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 25 - July 1, 2023, as
Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week in the State of New York; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
