  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2023, as Dysautonomia Awareness Month in the
  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
  observance of National Dysautonomia Awareness Month
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this  Legislative  Body  to bring
awareness to the major health concerns that exist within this State  and
Nation,  and  to honor those organizations which work towards addressing
these concerns and creating treatments and cures  for  life  threatening
illnesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, society calls upon these individuals and
organizations  to  be  recognized  for  the  significance  of  their
contributions and efforts to  assist  others  in  the  arena  of  public
health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant to such concern, this Legislative Body is justly
proud to commend the efforts of Dysautonomia International, a non-profit
organization which seeks to improve the lives of individuals living with
autonomic  nervous  system  disorders  through  research,  physician
education, public awareness and patient empowerment programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dysautonomia  is a group of medical conditions that result
in a malfunction of the automatic nervous system, which  is  responsible
for  "automatic" bodily functions such as respiration, heart rate, blood
pressure, digestion, temperature control and more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some forms of dysautonomia are  considered  rare  diseases,
such  as Multiple System Atrophy and Pure Autonomic Failure, while other
forms of dysautonomia are common, impacting millions of  people  in  the
United  States  and  around  the  world,  such  as  Diabetic  Autonomic
Neuropathy,  Neurocardiogenic  Syncope  and  Postural  Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dysautonomia  impacts people of every age, gender, race or
background, including many individuals living here in  New  York  State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  forms of dysautonomia can be very disabling and this
disability can result in social isolation, stress  on  the  families  of
those impacted, and financial hardship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dysautonomia  can  result  in  death,  causing  tremendous
emotional pain and suffering for the loved ones of those inflicted; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increased  awareness  about  dysautonomia  will  help  get
patients  diagnosed  and treated earlier, save lives, and foster support
for  individuals  and  families  coping  with  dysautonomia  in  our
communities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2023,  as
Dysautonomia  Awareness  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction
 
with the observance of National Dysautonomia Awareness Month; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and Dysautonomia International.
