  3. The board may not grant a certificate for the construction or oper-
 ation  of a major electric generating facility, either as proposed or as
 modified by the board, unless the board determines that:
  (a) the facility is a beneficial addition to or substitution  for  the
 electric generation capacity of the state; and
  (b)  the  construction  and  operation  of the facility will serve the
 public interest; and
  (c) the adverse environmental effects of the construction  and  opera-
 tion  of the facility will be minimized or avoided to the maximum extent
 practicable; and
  (d) if the board finds that the facility results in or contributes  to
 a  significant  and adverse disproportionate environmental impact in the
 community in which the facility would be  located,  the  applicant  will
 avoid,  offset  or  minimize the impacts caused by the facility upon the
 local community for the duration that the certificate is issued  to  the
 maximum extent practicable using verifiable measures; and
  (e)  the facility is designed to operate in compliance with applicable
 state and local laws and regulations issued thereunder concerning, among
 other matters, the environment, public health and safety, all  of  which
 shall be binding upon the applicant, except that the board may elect not
 to  apply,  in whole or in part, any local ordinance, law, resolution or
 other action or any regulation issued thereunder or any  local  standard
 or  requirement,  including,  but  not limited to, those relating to the
 interconnection to and use of water, electric, sewer, telecommunication,
 fuel and steam lines in public rights of way, which would  be  otherwise
 applicable  if  it finds that, as applied to the proposed facility, such
 is unreasonably burdensome in view of the  existing  technology  or  the
 needs  of  or  costs  to ratepayers whether located inside or outside of
 such municipality. The board shall provide the municipality an  opportu-
 A. 3223  5
 
 nity  to present evidence in support of such ordinance, law, resolution,

 CONSERVATION LAW.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
