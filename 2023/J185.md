  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 17-23, 2023, as Telehealth Awareness  Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official weeks established to increase awareness of medical issues  that
affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 17-23, 2023,  as  Telehealth
Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Telehealth Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, From  September  19-25,  2021,  the  American  Telemedicine
Association  (ATA)  will  sponsor  the  first  Telehealth Awareness Week
(TAW), a landmark event that will highlight and  reinforce  the  central
role  telehealth,  which  includes  asynchronous  and  synchronous
technologies, and remote patient monitoring, now plays in  the  delivery
of healthcare; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  ATA will host a series of events, publish educational
resources, and share patient and healthcare  provider  experiences  that
support  the  permanent  adoption of telehealth as part of a two-channel
care delivery system which combines in-person and virtual care; and
 
  WHEREAS, The expansion of telehealth has played a critical  role  in
supporting  the  health  of  patients  and  families  in  New  York  and
addressing healthcare disparities that prevent  members  of  underserved
communities from receiving the care they need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is imperative that there be greater awareness of these
vital health care, health education, and health information services via
remote technologies, and more must  be  done  to  increase  activity  at
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 17-23, 2023,  as
Telehealth Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York and the American Telemedicine Association.
