  COMMENDING  the  Jewish War Veterans of the United
  States of America, and paying tribute to its members
  for their outstanding contributions to our Nation
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Services from the State of  New  York,
who  have  served  so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars in which this
country's freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of  peace
in peacetime, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend the Jewish
War  Veterans  of the United States of America (JWV), and to pay tribute
to its members for their outstanding contributions to our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded on March 15, 1896, by 63  Jewish  veterans  of  the
American  Civil War, the JWV was and is the oldest veterans organization
in the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, this  esteemed  veterans  organization
has  been  a  force against bigotry in America, while working to support
the Jewish Community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Now in its 126th year of service, the JWV and  its  women's
auxiliary  continue  to  serve  our  Nation's  veterans  through  active
programs on behalf of the war wounded and  those  who  are  patients  in
Veterans  Administration  hospitals  and  participates  in and organizes
several Jewish as well as patriotic programs across the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, there are numerous posts located throughout  New
York,  and  the  United  States as a whole; one such organization is the
David J. Kauffman Post 401 of the JWV of  the  Finger  Lakes  which  was
founded on June 12, 1932; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  true  to  the  mission of the JWV, the David J.
Kauffman Post 401 has made numerous contributions  to  the  success  and
progress  of  society which have truly enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through its long and sustained commitment to the ideals and
principles upon which this beloved Nation was first founded, the  Jewish
War  Veterans  of  the United States of America has unselfishly advanced
that  spirit  of  united  purpose  and  shared  concern  which  is  the
unalterable manifestation of our American experience; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, and  to
pay  tribute  to  its members for their outstanding contributions to our
Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America.
