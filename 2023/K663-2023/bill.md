BY: M. of A. Joyner
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 11, 2023, as Hip Hop Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
seek  to  preserve  and  celebrate the musical heritage of our State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 11,  2023,  as  Hip
Hop Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  August  11, 1973, at a Back To School Jam organized by
his sister Cindy Campbell, and held  at  the  recreation  room  of  1520
Sedgwick  Avenue  in  the  Bronx,  New York, Clive DJ Kool Herc Campbell
introduced his innovative style of disk jockeying and, together with the
master of ceremonies engaging the crowd with rap on the microphone while
party-goers known as B-boys and B-girls danced, introduced a new  style,
later  known  as  Hip  Hop, which combined the elements of a disk jockey
(commonly known as a DJ), a master of ceremonies (commonly known  as  an
MC), music, art, fashion, and dance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  its  humble  beginnings in New York City, the music,
lyricism, dance, fashion, and art of Hip Hop has become a  culture,  now
found  in  communities  across  the  United  States, and has long been a
worldwide phenomenon; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hip Hop  artists  and  supporters,  originally  of  African
heritage,  now  transcend  many  different ages, ethnicities, religions,
locations, political affiliations,  and  socioeconomic  statuses,  which
demonstrates the melting-pot quality of Hip Hop art and culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception, Hip Hop has inspired generations of
young people to express themselves and celebrate their culture, and  has
greatly  contributed to the entertainment and cultural enrichment of its
community and the entire State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim August 11, 2023, as Hip
Hop Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of New York.
