 "prepaid" system, funds may be deposited into an account in order to pay

 shall  require the department to provide or administer a prepaid system.
 Under a "collect call" system, call recipients are billed for  the  cost

 ual  telephone  service,  as an additional means of payment, must permit
 the recipient of incarcerated individual calls to establish  an  account
 with  such  provider  in  order to deposit funds to pay for such collect
 calls in advance] STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES CHARGED  WITH  THE  OPERATION
 AND  MANAGEMENT  OF STATE AND LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND JUVENILE
 DETENTION FACILITIES SHALL PROVIDE PERSONS IN THEIR CUSTODY AND CONFINED
 IN A CORRECTIONAL OR DETENTION FACILITY WITH VOICE COMMUNICATION SERVICE
