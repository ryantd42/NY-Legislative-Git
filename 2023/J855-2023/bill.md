  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body to commemorate
and recognize certain milestones celebrated by citizens  of  this  great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to

to so many; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  her  Christian  faith  has  always  been  a
significant anchor in her life, she sees ministry  not  merely  as  that
 
which  she  is  blessed  to  receive,  but that which she is blessed and
called to share with others within her church and the  wider  community;

  WHEREAS,  Julia Rinehardt has enriched the lives of those around her
through her joyous and sincere love for others and through the quiescent
charm and wisdom which comes only from a fullness of years; and

themselves contributing to the  growth  and  excellence  of  this  great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
