 arrange  for  the  consultation  and evaluation within thirty days after
 receiving the notification and must within ten  days  thereafter  notify
 its insurer and the department of labor in writing of the means by which
 the  evaluation  is  to  be  accomplished. The employer must provide its

 an inspection to ascertain whether the recommended remedial  action  has
 been implemented, and the insurer shall within forty-five days thereaft-
 er  provide  to  the  employer and the department of labor a copy of its
 inspection report.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
