  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
foster  ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 23, 2023, as Pakistan Day in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pakistan  Day  is  a  national  holiday  in  Pakistan
commemorating the Lahore Resolution passed on March 23,  1940,  and  the
adoption  of the first constitution of Pakistan during the transition of
the Dominion of Pakistan to the Islamic Republic of  Pakistan  on  March
23, 1956, making it the world's first Islamic republic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  the  citizens  of  Pakistan  come together to
celebrate this special day with a full military and civilian  parade  in
the  capital, Islamabad; these are presided by the President of Pakistan
and are held early in the  morning;  after  the  parade,  the  President
confers national awards and medals on the awardees at the Presidency and
wreaths  are  also laid at the mausoleums of Muhammad Iqbal, regarded as
having inspired the Pakistan  Movement  and  Muhammad  Ali  Jinnah,  the
founder of Pakistan; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pakistan  Day provides an excellent means by which all New
Yorkers  can  learn  more  about  the  rich  Pakistani  heritage,  while
fostering  an  appreciation  for  this  ancient  culture  among  future
generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York City is the home to  194,000  American-Pakistanis;
the  community of people who came to New York from Pakistan, or who have
ancestral ties to  the  homeland,  share  their  cherished  culture  and
traditions  with  Americans  of  all  backgrounds,  and  they uphold the
principles of freedom and democracy that are fundamental to life in  our
great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Pakistani-American community demonstrate a
strong work ethic that has enabled them to realize many  accomplishments
and  find  continued success in this State and Nation, and they continue
to excel in a wide range of professions  such  as  education,  medicine,
science, technology, business and industry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to acknowledge various
cultures of people who add to the overall diversity of our State and, on
this occasion, we take the opportunity to  recognize  the  contributions
made  by  the Pakistani-American community and extend best wishes to all
of its members as they hold appropriate ceremonies to  commemorate  this
historic milestone; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  23,  2023,  as
Pakistan Day in the State of New York; and be it further
