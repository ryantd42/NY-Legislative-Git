 AN ACT directing a state agency telework report
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "State agency telework report act".
  §  2.  Legislative intent. The legislature takes notice of the growing
 practice of the use of telework as a future form of work away  from  the
 principal place of employment. Telecommuting is being used more and more
 by  businesses as a way to save money for employers by reducing contrib-
 utions to workers' compensation premiums, allowing more  freedom  for  a
 balance  between  work  and  family  life  for  employees,  reducing air
 pollution and traffic congestion, reducing absenteeism, and  accommodat-
 ing those who are disabled.
  Teleworking  warrants  further  research to enable the state to move a
 step closer to using it as a way to save taxpayer's  money,  while  also
 benefiting the state and its employees.
  §  3. Definitions. As used in this act, the following terms shall have
 the following meanings:
  (a) "State  agency" means any state department, board,  bureau,  divi-
 sion,  commission,  committee,  public  authority, public benefit corpo-
 ration, council, office, or other  governmental  entity  performing  a
 governmental or proprietary function for the state.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (b) "Telework" means to perform normal and regular work functions on a
 workday  that  ordinarily would be performed at the state agency's offi-
 cial principal location or locations, at a different location.
  § 4. State agency telework report.  (a) Each state agency shall submit
 a  report to the department of civil service by July 1, 2025 which shall
 contain the following:
  (i) Number of employees that teleworked in 2024;
  (ii) Job titles that teleworked in 2024;
  (iii) Number of days teleworked by anonymized employee in 2024;
  (iv) Number of days teleworked by job title in 2024;
  (v) Any benefits of telework remarked by the agency;
  (vi) Any disadvantages of telework remarked by the agency; and
  (vii) A copy of the agency's official telework policy, if any, includ-
 ing how employees and job titles are chosen for telework.
  In addition, each state agency shall allow  employees  to  anonymously
 submit  their  opinions  of  the  agency's telecommuting policy, or lack
 thereof, which the agencies shall include in the telework  state  agency
 report  due to the department of civil service and which shall be summa-
 rized in the finalized  report  compiled  by  the  department  of  civil
 service pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section.
  (b)  On  or  before  September 1, 2025 the department of civil service
 shall provide a report compiling all the  agency  telework  reports  and
 submit  such  compiled  report  to  the  speaker of the assembly and the
 temporary president of the senate.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
