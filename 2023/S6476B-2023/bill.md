 AN ACT to create a demonstration program and task force on teleworking
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Telework 2023 Act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature takes notice of  the  growing
 practice  of  the use of telework as a future form of work away from the
 principal place of employment. Telecommuting is being used more and more
 by businesses as a way to save money  for  employers  by  reducing  real
 estate  costs, reducing contributions to workers' compensation premiums,
 allowing more freedom for a balance between work  and  family  life  for
 employees,  reducing  air  pollution  and  traffic  congestion, reducing
 absenteeism,  and  accommodating  those  who  are  disabled.  For  these
 reasons,  telework  has  a very promising future as a form of out of the
 office work.
  Teleworking warrants further research to enable the state  to  move  a
 step  closer  to  using it as a way to save taxpayer's money, while also
 benefiting the state and its employees.
  § 3. Definitions. As used in this act, the following terms shall  have
 the following meanings:
  (a) "Remote work center (telework center)" means a workspace typically
 close  to employees' homes used part-time by remote workers in full-time
 or part-time employment.
  (b) "Satellite office" means a workspace typically used  full-time  by
 employees who live near them.
  (c)  "Telecommuter"  means an employee who has a primary office in his
 or her employer's office, but has the training, permission, and telecom-
 puting technology to work on an as-needed basis in  a  remote  location,
 typically in the employee's home.
  (d)  "Teleworker" means an employee with the training, permission, and
 telecomputing technology to work part- or full-time in a location  other
 than his or her employer's main office.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  § 4. Telework 2023 task force and demonstration program.  (a) There is
 hereby  created  the telework 2023 task force consisting of the depart-
 ments of environmental conservation, transportation, and civil  service,
 the workers' compensation board, the office of general services, and the
 office  of advocate for persons with disabilities.  The task force shall
 be chaired by the designee of the governor.  The chair may appoint other
 state administrative agencies which may prove beneficial to the work  of
 the task force as ad hoc members. The chair may also appoint individuals
 and  representatives  of  organizations  other than state administrative
 agencies to an advisory committee to advise on any aspect of  its  func-
 tions,  powers,  and duties.  The temporary president of the senate and
 the speaker of the assembly shall each appoint a  liaison  to  the  task
 force.  The  advisory committee may be compensated for only actual and
 necessary expenses from existing funds from task force agencies.
  (b) The task force shall be the administrative forum for:
  (1) identifying ways to improve productivity through teleworking; and
  (2) advancing the goal of promoting teleworking.
  (c) The task force shall:
  (1) identify technical assistance and training for state  agencies  to
 assist them in implementing teleworking;
  (2)  identify  and  recommend  means  to  improve productivity, reduce
 costs, and enhance the quality of life of employees through teleworking;
  (3) identify and assist in the development and dissemination of useful
 models for teleworking; and
  (4) review applicable statutes and budget authorization,  the  current
 activities,  regulations, policies, proposed budgets and proposed legis-
 lation of the demonstration program agencies which  would  affect  tele-
 working  and  make  recommendations to those agencies and the governor's
 office, as appropriate, on any changes that would  facilitate  telework-
 ing.
  (d)  The  task force shall implement a demonstration program involving
 employees  of  the  following  state  departments:  financial  services,
 health,  and  transportation  and  the division of housing and community
 renewal, in collaboration with such agencies.
  (1) In the first phase, the task force and demonstration program agen-
 cies shall identify suitable employees for participation.
  (2) In the second phase, the  task  force  agencies  shall  study  the
 impact  of  teleworking on the demonstration program agencies, including
 benefits and detriments to the agencies and  the  employees.  Each  task
 force  agency  shall  apply  its expertise as follows: The department of
 environmental conservation shall report on the  impact  teleworking  has
 upon  the  environment,  the workers' compensation board shall report on
 the impact on workers' compensation claims, benefits, and premiums,  the
 department  of  transportation shall report on reductions in transporta-
 tion use, the department of civil service shall report on the impact  to
 employees  and  employers  concerning  absenteeism and productivity, the
 office of general services shall report reductions in  necessary  office
 and parking space, and the office of advocate for persons with disabili-
 ties  shall  report  on  the  benefits of accommodation to those who are
 permanently and temporarily disabled.
  § 5. Report. Eighteen months after the implementation  of  the  demon-
 stration program, it shall be concluded, and the task force shall report
 its  findings  and  recommendations to the governor and the legislature.
 Such report shall be bound and made available to the public.
  § 6. This act shall take effect on the first of November next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
