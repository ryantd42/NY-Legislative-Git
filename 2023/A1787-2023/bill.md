 AN ACT to amend the energy  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  a  one
  hundred  percent  clean  energy  system by two thousand thirty-two; to
  amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to the  adoption
  of  a climate action plan; to amend the state finance law, in relation

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  New York state's continued use of
 fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is having  devastat-
 ing  impacts  on our climate and communities. Our state's ongoing use of
 nuclear fuels continues to create immensely radioactive wastes that will
 be dangerous to future generations for millennia.  It  is  in  the  best
 interest of the people of New York to move the state into a clean energy
 revolution,  meeting 100 percent of our energy needs from clean, renewa-
 ble sources by 2032. Transitioning to clean  energy  is  fundamental  to
 protecting  our communities, particularly communities of color and lower
 income communities that are disproportionately affected by the worsening
 air and water quality that  results  from  the  incineration  of  fossil
 fuels.  A  transition  to  a  100  percent  clean  energy system will be
 achieved in a way that protects displaced fossil fuel workers,  impacted
 communities,  builds  a  stronger economy for everyone in the state, and
 creates hundreds of thousands of new jobs, while at the same time elimi-
 nating New York's  contribution  to  the  biggest  environmental  threat
 facing our planet, climate change.

 DISPOSAL SYSTEM AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE ANIMAL  AGRI-
 CULTURAL  SECTOR BY PROMOTING PASTURE-BASED, SUSTAINABLE ANIMAL AGRICUL-
 TURAL SYSTEMS AND ELIMINATING INDUSTRIAL STYLE CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEED-
 ING OPERATIONS FROM OPERATING IN THE STATE.
  (D) THE PLAN SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE DISCONTINUANCE OF STATE  INVESTMENT

 SUCH FACILITIES.
  (E) THE PLAN SHALL INCLUDE, IN TWO-YEAR  INCREMENTS,  DETAILED  BENCH-
 MARKS  AND  STEPS  NEEDED  TO  ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
 CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY-TWO. INTERIM  GOALS

 GAS, OIL, COAL, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS SHALL BE CONTROLLING ONLY FOR THE
 SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DISCONTINUE THE USE OF SUCH
 FUELS BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY-TWO.
  (G) THE PLAN SHALL INCORPORATE MEASURES RELATED TO REDUCTION IN ENERGY
 USE, INCREASED ENERGY CONSERVATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIEN-
 CY; IT SHALL ALSO PROMOTE REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE TO HELP RETURN CARBON
