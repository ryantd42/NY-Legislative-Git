  § 2. Subdivision 7 of section 163 of the state finance law, as amended
 by section 2 of subpart A of part KK of chapter 57 of the laws of  2018,
 is amended to read as follows:
  7. Method of procurement. Consistent with the requirements of subdivi-
 sions  three and four of this section, state agencies shall select among
 permissible methods of procurement including, but  not  limited  to,  an
 invitation for bid, request for proposals or other means of solicitation
 pursuant  to  guidelines  issued by the state procurement council. State
 agencies may accept bids  electronically  including  submission  of  the
 statement of non-collusion required by section one hundred thirty-nine-d
 of  this chapter, and the statement of certification required by section
 one hundred thirty-nine-l of this chapter, THE STATEMENT ON HUMAN  TRAF-
 FICKING  AND WRITTEN POLICY FOR PREVENTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING REQUIRED BY
 SECTION ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE-D-1 OF THIS CHAPTER, and, starting April
 first, two thousand twelve, and ending March thirty-first, two  thousand
 fifteen,  may,  for  commodity, service and technology contracts require
 electronic submission as the sole method for the submission of bids  for
 the  solicitation.  State  agencies shall undertake no more than eighty-
 five such electronic bid solicitations, none of which shall  be  reverse
 auctions, prior to April first, two thousand fifteen. In addition, state
 agencies  may  conduct  up to twenty reverse auctions through electronic
 means, prior to April first, two thousand fifteen.  Prior  to  requiring
 the  electronic  submission  of  bids,  the agency shall make a determi-
 nation, which shall be documented in the procurement record, that  elec-
 tronic  submission  affords a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to
 submit responsive offers. Within thirty days of the  completion  of  the
 eighty-fifth  electronic  bid solicitation, or by April first, two thou-
 sand fifteen, whichever is earlier, the  commissioner  shall  prepare  a
 report  assessing the use of electronic submissions and make recommenda-
 tions regarding future use of  this  procurement  method.  In  addition,
 within  thirty  days  of the completion of the twentieth reverse auction
 through electronic means, or  by  April  first,  two  thousand  fifteen,
 whichever  is earlier, the commissioner shall prepare a report assessing
 the use of reverse auctions through electronic means and make  recommen-
 dations  regarding  future  use of this procurement method. Such reports
 shall be published on the website of the  office  of  general  services.
 A. 6423  3
 
 Except  where  otherwise  provided by law, procurements shall be compet-
 itive, and state agencies shall conduct formal competitive  procurements
 to  the  maximum  extent  practicable. State agencies shall document the
 determination of the method of procurement and the basis of award in the
 procurement  record.  Where the basis for award is the best value offer,
 the state agency shall  document,  in  the  procurement  record  and  in
 advance of the initial receipt of offers, the determination of the eval-
 uation criteria, which whenever possible, shall be quantifiable, and the
 process  to be used in the determination of best value and the manner in
 which the evaluation process and selection shall be conducted.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have  become  a law and shall only apply to contracts entered into on or
 after such effective date; provided  however,  that  the  amendments  to
 subdivision  7  of  section 163 of the state finance law made by section
 two of this act shall not affect the repeal of such section and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
