  value  of  rent  subsidies  to  be  included  as  a part of preventive

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision 5 of section 409-a of the
 social services law, as amended by chapter 624 of the laws of  2019,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (c)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this section, where a
 social services official determines that a lack of adequate  housing  is
 the  primary factor preventing the discharge of a child or children from
 foster care including, but not limited to, children  with  the  goal  of
 discharge  to  independent living, preventive services shall include, in
 addition to any other payments  or  benefits  received  by  the  family,
 special  cash  grants  in  the  form  of  rent subsidies, including rent
 arrears, or any other assistance, sufficient to obtain adequate housing.
 Such rent subsidies or assistance shall not exceed the  sum  of  [three]
 SIX  hundred  dollars  per  month, shall not be provided for a period of
 more than three years, and shall be considered a special grant.  Nothing
 in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the ability of those using
 such  rent  subsidy to live with roommates. The provisions of this para-
 graph shall not be construed  to  limit  such  official's  authority  to
 provide other preventive services.
  §  2.  Subdivision  7  of section 409-a of the social services law, as
 amended by chapter 624 of the laws  of  2019,  is  amended  to  read  as

 or  benefits  received by the family, special cash grants in the form of
 rent subsidies, including rent arrears, or any other assistance,  suffi-
 cient  to  obtain  adequate  housing.  Such rent subsidies or assistance
 shall not exceed the sum of [three] SIX hundred dollars per month, shall
 not be provided for a period of more than  three  years,  and  shall  be
 considered  a  special  grant.  Nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall be
 construed to limit the ability of those using such rent subsidy to  live
 with  roommates. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed
