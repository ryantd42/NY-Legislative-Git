 individual by reason of his or her having been convicted of one or  more
 criminal  offenses,  or  by reason of a finding of a lack of "good moral
 character" which is based upon his or her having been convicted  of  one
 or  more  criminal  offenses,  when  such  denial is in violation of the
 provisions of article twenty-three-A of  the  correction  law.  Further,
 there  shall  be  a  rebuttable  presumption  in favor of excluding from
 evidence the prior incarceration or conviction of any person, in a  case
 alleging  that the employer has been negligent in hiring or retaining an

 such employer has evaluated the  factors  set  forth  in  section  seven
 hundred  fifty-two  of  the  correction law, and made a reasonable, good
 faith determination that such factors  militate  in  favor  of  hire  or
 retention  of  that  applicant  or  employee. NO PERSON, AGENCY, BUREAU,
 CORPORATION, ASSOCIATION, THE STATE OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION  THERE-
 OF, SHALL REQUIRE AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROVIDE A COPY OF HIS OR HER CRIMINAL
