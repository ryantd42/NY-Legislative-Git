 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  disability  retirement  benefits for the presumption of post-traumatic
  stress disorder for certain titles
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 605-h to read as follows:
  §  605-H.  DISABILITY RETIREMENT FOR CERTAIN DISPATCHERS. 1.  A MEMBER
 EMPLOYED AS  A  COMMUNICATIONS  TECHNICIAN,  COMMUNICATIONS  SPECIALIST,
 COMMUNICATIONS  OPERATOR,  RADIO  DISPATCHER, OR EMERGENCY DISPATCHER BY
 ANY STATE AGENCY, DEPARTMENT, OR DIVISION, A COUNTY  911  DISPATCHER,  A
 COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER SUPERVISOR, A NEW YORK CITY FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER,
 A  NEW  YORK  CITY  SUPERVISING FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER LEVEL ONE OR A NEW
 YORK CITY SUPERVISING FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER LEVEL TWO SHALL BE  ENTITLED
 TO DISABILITY RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE, IF, AT THE TIME APPLICATION THEREFOR
 IS  FILED,  SUCH  MEMBER  IS  PHYSICALLY  OR  MENTALLY INCAPACITATED FOR
 PERFORMANCE OF DUTY AS A RESULT  OF  CONTRACTING  POST-TRAUMATIC  STRESS
 DISORDER WHILE SO EMPLOYED AND AS A RESULT OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.
  2.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER OR OF ANY GENERAL,
 SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY MEMBER WHO IS A COMMUNICATIONS
 TECHNICIAN, COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST,  COMMUNICATIONS  OPERATOR,  RADIO
 DISPATCHER,  OR EMERGENCY DISPATCHER BY ANY STATE AGENCY, DEPARTMENT, OR
 DIVISION, A COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER, A COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER SUPERVISOR, A
 NEW YORK CITY FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER, A NEW YORK  CITY  SUPERVISING  FIRE

 A. 6861--A  2
 
 STRESS  DISORDER  RESULTING IN DISABILITY TO SUCH FIRE ALARM DISPATCHER,
 PRESENTLY EMPLOYED, AND WHO SHALL HAVE SUSTAINED SUCH  DISABILITY  WHILE
 SO EMPLOYED, SHALL HAVE SUCH DIAGNOSIS BE PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH
 DISABILITY WAS INCURRED IN THE PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE OF DUTY, UNLESS
 THE CONTRARY BE PROVEN BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.
  3.  THE  ANNUAL  RETIREMENT  ALLOWANCE  PAYABLE  SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE
 THREE-QUARTERS OF THEIR FINAL AVERAGE SALARY, SUBJECT TO THE  PROVISIONS
 OF SECTION SIXTY-FOUR OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would grant improved disability eligibility to any Tier 3,
 4, 5 or 6 member of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System (NYSLERS) employed in the title of
  1. Communication technician, specialist, or operator,
  2. Radio dispatcher or Emergency dispatcher, or
  3. County 911 dispatcher or supervisor.
  For any member so employed who is diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
 disorder, resulting in disability, such diagnosis shall be considered as
 presumptive evidence that the disability was incurred in the performance
 of  the  member's  duties,  unless  the  contrary be proven by competent
 evidence. The annual accidental disability  benefit  for  these  members
 would be 75% of final average salary (FAS), minus workers' compensation.
 Current disability benefits vary by employer.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.4 billion.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $445 million as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of the
 State of New York and local participating  employers  will  increase  by
 2.0%  of  affected  member  salary,  or approximately $42 million to the
 State of New York and 49.5 million to the local participating employers,
 beginning in fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.  This  PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
  Further, this proposal will require many of  the  3,000  participating
 employers  to  modify  their  reporting  to  the NYSLERS to identify the
 affected members. As a result, we anticipate  additional  administrative
 costs to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
