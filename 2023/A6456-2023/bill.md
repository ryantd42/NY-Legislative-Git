 AN ACT relating to the investigation  of  and  findings  of  educational
  neglect of a child during the COVID-19 pandemic
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. a. Notwithstanding any  law,  rule  or  regulation  to  the
 contrary, evidence of a child's excessive absence from school shall not,
 by  itself, be sufficient to find that a parent or guardian of the child
 failed to provide an adequate education to such child if such  excessive
 absence:
  (i)  occurred during the state disaster emergency declared pursuant to
 executive order 202  of  2020  in  response  to  the  novel  coronavirus
 (COVID-19) pandemic; and
  (ii)  is  a  result of the child not having the opportunity to partic-
 ipate in remote learning due to:
  (A) a lack of resources or opportunity that would enable the child  to
 do  so,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  lack of access to necessary
 computer or other electronic equipment or lack of connectivity  opportu-
 nity; or
  (B) the fact that the child's parent or guardian is an essential work-
 er, is caring for someone with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is sick
 with  the  novel coronavirus (COVID-19), or is in mandatory isolation or
 quarantine.
  b. Upon a determination that a child's excessive absence  from  school
 is due solely to the factors listed in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subdi-
 vision  a of this section, any investigation into a claim of educational
 neglect of the child upon a complaint or report by a  school  or  school
 district  shall  be  closed  unless the school or school district demon-
 strates that the child has had the opportunity and resources to  partic-
 ipate in remote learning and has not done so.
