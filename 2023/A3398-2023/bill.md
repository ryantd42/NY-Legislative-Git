  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Health
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public  health law and the family court act, in
  relation to notice of abortions performed on unemancipated minors
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative purpose and findings. It is the intent of this
 legislature in enacting this parental notice provision  to  further  the
 important  and  compelling  state interests of protecting minors against
 their own immaturity, fostering the family structure and  preserving  it
 as  a viable social unit, protecting the rights of parents to rear chil-
 dren who are members of their household, and protecting  the  health  of
 minor children.
  The  legislature  finds that immature minors often lack the ability to
 make fully-informed choices that take  account  of  both  immediate  and
 long-range  consequences  and that the medical, emotional and psycholog-
 ical consequences of abortion are serious and can  be  lasting,  partic-
 ularly  when the patient is immature. The legislature further finds that
 the capacity to become pregnant and the  capacity  for  mature  judgment
 concerning  the  wisdom  of an abortion are not necessarily related. The
 legislature finds that parents ordinarily possess information  essential
 to  a  physician's  exercise of his best medical judgment concerning the
 child and, further, that parents who are aware that their minor daughter
 has had an abortion may better ensure that she receives adequate medical
 attention after her  abortion.  The  legislature  concludes  then,  that
 parental  consultation  is usually desirable and in the best interest of
 the minor.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  2509-b
 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  § 2509-B. NOTIFICATION OF ABORTIONS ON UNEMANCIPATED MINORS.  1. DEFI-
 NITIONS.  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS
 WILL APPLY:
  (A)  "UNEMANCIPATED MINOR" MEANS A PERSON WHO HAS NOT ATTAINED THE AGE
 OF EIGHTEEN YEARS AND IS NOT AN EMANCIPATED MINOR AS  DEFINED  IN  PARA-
 GRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (B)  "EMANCIPATED  MINOR"  MEANS  A  MINOR WHO IS OR HAS BEEN LAWFULLY
 MARRIED OR HAS BY COURT ORDER OR OTHERWISE BEEN  FREED  FROM  THE  CARE,
 CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF HER PARENTS.
  (C)  "ABORTION" MEANS THE USE OF ANY INSTRUMENT, MEDICINE, DRUG OR ANY
 OTHER SUBSTANCE OR DEVICE WITH INTENT TO TERMINATE THE  PREGNANCY  OF  A
 WOMAN KNOWN TO BE PREGNANT WITH INTENT OTHER THAN TO INCREASE THE PROBA-
 BILITY  OF  A  LIVE  BIRTH,  TO PRESERVE THE LIFE OR HEALTH OF THE CHILD
 AFTER LIVE BIRTH, OR TO REMOVE A DEAD FETUS.
  (D) "MEDICAL EMERGENCY" MEANS THAT CONDITION WHICH, ON  THE  BASIS  OF
 THE PHYSICIAN'S GOOD FAITH CLINICAL JUDGMENT, SO COMPLICATES THE MEDICAL
 CONDITION OF THE PREGNANT MINOR AS TO NECESSITATE THE IMMEDIATE ABORTION
 OF HER PREGNANCY TO AVERT HER DEATH OR FOR WHICH DELAY WILL CREATE SERI-
 OUS  RISK  OF  SUBSTANTIAL AND IRREVERSIBLE IMPAIRMENT OF A MAJOR BODILY
 FUNCTION.
  2. NOTIFICATION  CONCERNING  ABORTION.  NO  PERSON  SHALL  PERFORM  AN
 ABORTION  UPON  AN  UNEMANCIPATED  MINOR  UNLESS HE OR SHE OR HIS OR HER
 AGENT HAS GIVEN AT LEAST FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WRITTEN NOTICE TO A CUSTODIAL
 PARENT WITH WHOM THE MINOR RESIDES OR TO THE LEGAL GUARDIAN OF THE PREG-
 NANT MINOR OF HIS OR HER INTENTION TO PERFORM THE ABORTION OR UNLESS  HE
 OR  SHE  OR  HIS  OR  HER AGENT HAS RECEIVED A WRITTEN STATEMENT OR ORAL
 COMMUNICATION, BY ANOTHER PHYSICIAN, HEREINAFTER CALLED  THE  "REFERRING
 PHYSICIAN", CERTIFYING THAT THE REFERRING PHYSICIAN HAS EFFECTUATED SUCH
 NOTICE.  IF THE MINOR'S PARENTS ARE DIVORCED OR LEGALLY SEPARATED, AND A
 CUSTODIAL PARENT WITH WHOM THE MINOR RESIDES IS  NOT  AVAILABLE  TO  THE
 PERSON  PERFORMING  THE ABORTION OR THE REFERRING PHYSICIAN IN A REASON-
 ABLE TIME OR MANNER, THEN THE NOTICE TO A NON-CUSTODIAL PARENT OR TO THE
 PARENT WHO IS AVAILABLE SHALL BE SUFFICIENT.
  (A) THE WRITTEN NOTICE SHALL BE ADDRESSED TO THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN AT
 THE USUAL PLACE OF  ABODE  OF  THE  PARENT  OR  GUARDIAN  AND  DELIVERED
 PERSONALLY TO THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN BY THE PHYSICIAN OR AN AGENT.
  (B) IN LIEU OF THE DELIVERY REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION,  NOTICE SHALL BE MADE BY CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO THE PARENT OR
 GUARDIAN AT THE USUAL PLACE OF ABODE OF  THE  PARENT  OR  GUARDIAN  WITH
 RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED WITH RESTRICTED DELIVERY TO THE ADDRESSEE. TIME
 OF  DELIVERY SHALL BE DEEMED TO OCCUR AT 12:00 O'CLOCK NOON ON THE THIRD
 DAY AFTER MAILING.
  3. WAIVER OF NOTICE. NO NOTICE SHALL BE REQUIRED  UNDER  THIS  SECTION
 IF:
  (A)  THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN CERTIFIES IN THE PREGNANT MINOR'S MEDICAL
 RECORD THAT A MEDICAL EMERGENCY EXISTS; OR
  (B) THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO NOTICE CERTIFY IN  WRIT-
 ING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED; OR
  (C)  THE MINOR OBJECTS TO NOTICE BEING GIVEN HER CUSTODIAL PARENT WITH
 WHOM THE MINOR RESIDES OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND OBTAINS AN ORDER ISSUED  BY
 A  JUDGE  OF THE FAMILY COURT AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE TEN-A OF THE FAMILY
 COURT ACT, OR BY ANY OTHER JUDGE OR JUSTICE OF THIS STATE HAVING  JURIS-
 DICTION, DISPENSING WITH SUCH NOTICE.
  4.  COERCION  PROHIBITED.  NO  PARENT,  GUARDIAN OR OTHER PERSON SHALL
 COERCE A MINOR TO UNDERGO AN ABORTION. ANY MINOR WHO IS THREATENED  WITH
 SUCH COERCION MAY APPLY TO A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION FOR RELIEF.
 A. 3398  3
 
 THE  COURT  SHALL  PROVIDE THE MINOR WITH COUNSEL, GIVE THE MATTER EXPE-
 DITED CONSIDERATION AND GRANT SUCH RELIEF AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT
 SUCH COERCION. SHOULD A MINOR BE DENIED FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF HER PARENTS
 BY REASON OF HER REFUSAL TO UNDERGO AN ABORTION, SHE SHALL BE CONSIDERED
 EMANCIPATED FOR PURPOSES OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE BENEFITS.
  5.  PENALTIES.  ANY PERSON WHO INTENTIONALLY PERFORMS AN ABORTION WITH
 KNOWLEDGE THAT, OR WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD AS  TO  WHETHER,  THE  PERSON
 UPON WHOM THE ABORTION IS TO BE PERFORMED IS AN UNEMANCIPATED MINOR, AND
 WHO INTENTIONALLY OR KNOWINGLY VIOLATES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL  BE  GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR. IN ADDITION, ANY PERSON WHO PERFORMS
 AN ABORTION UPON ANOTHER IN VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION SHALL  BE  SUBJECT
 TO  CIVIL  LIABILITY.  HOWEVER,  A PERSON SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE UNDER
 THIS SECTION IF THE PERSON ESTABLISHES  BY  WRITTEN  EVIDENCE  THAT  THE
 PERSON  RELIED  UPON EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE A REASONABLE PERSON
 THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE  PREGNANT  MINOR  REGARDING  INFORMATION
 NECESSARY  TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION ARE BONA FIDE AND TRUE, OR IF THE
 PERSON HAS ATTEMPTED WITH REASONABLE DILIGENCE TO  DELIVER  NOTICE,  BUT
 HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO.
  §  3. Paragraph (viii) of subdivision (a) of section 213 of the family
 court act, as amended by chapter 920 of the laws of 1982, is amended and

 tional hearing, and the final disposition of such cases[.];
  (IX) THE NUMBER AND DISPOSITION OF CASES UNDER ARTICLE TEN-D  OF  THIS
 ACT,  INCLUDING  THE  TOTAL  NUMBER  OF  NEW CASES, THE AGE OF THE MINOR

 SECTION ONE THOUSAND NINETY-NINE-B OF THIS ACT OR THAT THE ABORTIONS, AS
 DEFINED IN SECTION TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED NINE-B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH  LAW,
 WERE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE MINORS.

 JUDGMENT  IN  CONNECTION  WITH A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED WITH
 THE ABORTION.
  § 1099-B. JURISDICTION. THE FAMILY COURT HAS EXCLUSIVE ORIGINAL JURIS-

 PARENTAL NOTIFICATION OF AN ABORTION.
  § 1099-C. PROCEDURE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW:
  1. THE WAIVER OF PARENTAL NOTIFICATION TO AN ABORTION UPON OR WITH THE

 PERFORMED, ON APPLICATION BY SUCH PERSON OR BY A RELATIVE OF SUCH PERSON
 OR OTHER INTERESTED PARTY.

 sentence,  paragraph,  section  or part thereof directly involved in the
 controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
