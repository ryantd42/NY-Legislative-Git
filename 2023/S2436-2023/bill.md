  Section 1. Section 1263 of the public authorities law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 10 to read as follows:
  10.  WHERE  A  SUBSTANTIAL  NUMBER  OF  PERSONS ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND A
 PUBLIC HEARING AS THE  RESULT  OF  INSUFFICIENT  SEATING  CAPACITY,  ONE
 SUBSEQUENT, ADDITIONAL HEARING SHALL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH
 PUBLIC  HEARING  REQUIREMENTS.  SUCH SUBSEQUENT HEARING SHALL BE HELD IN
 REASONABLE PROXIMITY TO THE  LOCATION  OF  THE  HEARING  WHICH  DID  NOT
 PROVIDE  ADEQUATE  PUBLIC  ACCOMMODATIONS. AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE
 AUTHORITY SHALL RECORD THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF ANY INTERESTED PERSONS
 WHO ARE UNABLE TO ENTER A HEARING ROOM DUE TO CAPACITY  LIMITATIONS  AND
 SHALL NOTIFY SUCH PERSONS BY MAIL OF THE DATE AND LOCATION OF THE SUBSE-
 QUENT  HEARING,  IN  ADDITION  TO ANY OTHER HEARING NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
 WHERE THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INTEREST IS  ANTIC-
 IPATED  REGARDING THE ISSUE BEING ADDRESSED, A REQUIRED HEARING SHALL BE
 HELD IN A VENUE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH PUBLIC  PARTICIPATION.  THE
 AUTHORITY  SHALL  PRESUME THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC INTEREST IN
 FARE INCREASES OR SERVICE REDUCTIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION, "SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER" SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN MORE THAN SEVEN-
 TY-FIVE PERSONS.
