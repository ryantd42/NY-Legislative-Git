 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. GONZALEZ-ROJAS, JOYNER, GLICK, DAVILA, ROZIC,

  MITAYNES, GALLAGHER, CRUZ,  TAYLOR,  STIRPE,  SEPTIMO,  DE LOS SANTOS,
  GIBBS, RIVERA -- read once and referred to the Committee on Cities
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the general city law, the criminal procedure law, the
  charter of the city of New York and the  administrative  code  of  the
  city  of  New York, in relation to the regulation of street vendors in
  cities with a population of one million or more; and to repeal certain
  provisions of the administrative code of the city of New York relating
  thereto
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and declaration.  The legislature
 finds and declares that street vending plays a crucial role in New  York
 City's small business landscape, allowing immigrants, military veterans,
 and  others  to create a foothold in the City's economy.  Street vendors
 contribute significantly to the vibrancy of the City's  streetscape  and
 add  a visible cultural representation of the City's inhabitants. Howev-
 er, street vendors in New York  City  have  historically  faced  several
 barriers  to  business  viability  as  a result of antiquated City laws,
 rules, and policies limiting the number of vending permits and licenses,
 as well as the criminalization of vending by the New  York  City  Police
 Department  and  other  agencies.  To  effectuate the removal of these
 barriers, the legislature finds and declares that  there  should  be  no
 limit  on  the number of street vending permits and licenses that can be
 issued in the City. Artificially created limits on the number of  street
 vendors  only  forces  the  creation  of underground markets, as well as
 vendors operating without licenses or  permits  outside  the  regulatory
 system.  Street  vendors  should receive the basic opportunities to open
 small businesses to further stimulate the  City's  economy  as  well  as
 provide economic viability and mobility for entrepreneurship.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 A. 3575  2
 
  Furthermore, the legislature finds and declares that the New York City
 Police  Department should be prohibited from enforcing all street vendor
 laws and regulations. Street vendors deserve the same respect and expec-
 tations as other small businesses and  should  be  regulated  solely  by
 civilian agencies without fear of criminal justice consequences.
  §  2.  The general city law is amended by adding a new section 18-e to
