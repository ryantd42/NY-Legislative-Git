  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Correct Posture Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Correct Posture Month in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
Correct Posture Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Correct Posture Month encourages people to think about how
posture can affect their overall health; and
 
  WHEREAS, Posture refers to the position a person's body is in whilst
they are sitting or standing;  sedentary  activities  such  as  sitting,
reading,  playing  video  games,  and  using a computer, as well as more
physical activities like gardening,  bending  or  lifting  objects,  are
often performed with poor posture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Poor posture can negatively impact a person's health, with
back pain being the most common problem; additionally, side effects from
medicines used to control back pain can have a huge impact on a person's
physical and mental well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 2023, as Correct
Posture Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
