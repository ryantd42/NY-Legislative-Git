  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help  increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of the 26th Anniversary of ALS Ride for Life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sometimes  called  Lou
Gehrig's  disease, is a progressive disease that attacks the nerve cells
that control voluntary movement; and
 
  WHEREAS, In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and  the  lower  motor
neurons  degenerate  or die, ceasing to send messages to muscles; unable
to function, the muscles  gradually  weaken,  waste  away,  and  twitch;
ultimately,  the  ability  of  the  brain to start and control voluntary
movement is lost; and
 
  WHEREAS, Once ALS starts, it almost  always  progresses,  eventually
taking  away  the  ability  to  walk,  dress,  write, speak, swallow and
breathe, and shortening the life span; and
 
  WHEREAS, ALS is 100% fatal and has few  treatments  to  improve  the
quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  two  different  types  of  ALS,  sporadic  and
familial; sporadic, which is the most common form of the disease in  the
United  States,  encompasses  90  percent  of  all  cases; it may affect
anyone, anywhere; familial ALS (FALS) accounts for  10  percent  of  all
cases in the United States and means the disease is inherited; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most  people  live  about  three  to five years after they
experience their first signs of disease, with one in 10 people surviving
at least 10 years;  the  variable  rate  of  disease  progression  makes
prognosis difficult to predict and therapies challenging to develop; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every 90 minutes, someone is diagnosed with ALS; people who
develop  ALS  are  generally  between  the  ages  of 40 and 70, with the
majority after age 60, although it can occur at a younger age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  5,000  people  in  the  United  States  are
diagnosed  with  ALS  each year; the incidence of ALS is two per 100,000
people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  it  is  estimated  that  more  than  30,000
Americans may be living with ALS at any given time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most  surveys  find  that  ALS  is more common in men than
women, though that gap may be closing; in  addition,  military  veterans
are approximately twice as likely to develop ALS; and
 
  WHEREAS,  ALS  occurs  throughout  the world with no obvious racial,
ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month increases the
public's awareness of ALS patients' circumstances and  acknowledges  the
terrible  impact  this  disease  has  not  only on patients but on their
families as well; and
 
  WHEREAS, The ALS Ride for Life was founded in  1997  by  Christopher
Pendergast (PALS) who defied the odds, living with ALS for 28 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Prior  to  his  death  in  October  of  2020,  Christopher
Pendergast served as the President  and  driving  force  of  this  vital
organization  where he led a small but mighty staff and many volunteers;
since its inception, the ALS Ride for Life has provided funding to  many
leading  research  facilities  across the country including, Stony Brook
University, Johns Hopkins, and Columbia Presbyterian; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Christopher  Pendergast's  legacy  will  long  endure  the
passage of time as we celebrate the 26th Anniversary of the ALS Ride for
Life  which  benefits  countless  initiatives in the fight to save lives
from this devastating disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month in the State of New York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the ALS Ride for Life.
