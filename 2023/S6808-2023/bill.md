 established at not less than fifteen miles per hour, for a distance  not
 to exceed one thousand three hundred twenty feet, on a highway passing a
 school  building,  entrance or exit of a school abutting on the highway,
 and except that, with respect to bridge and elevated structures that are
 a  part  of  any such highway, a lower maximum speed limit may be estab-
 lished if it is determined that such lower maximum speed  limit  is  the
 maximum speed limit which may be maintained without structural damage to
 such  bridge  or structure, and except that, with respect to any highway
 under the jurisdiction of the office of parks, recreation  and  historic

 lished for passage through such toll plazas.

 tion shall have established higher or lower speed limits than the statu-
 tory  fifty-five  miles  per  hour  speed  limit  as provided in section
