  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 71-0213 of the  environmental  conserva-

  1.  Whenever  proceedings  result in a conviction for an offense under
 this chapter there shall be levied, in addition to any sentence required
 or permitted by law, the following  mandatory  surcharges:  (a)  in  the
 amount of twenty-five dollars for violations of sportfishing regulations
 set forth in 6 NYCRR 10; (b) in the amount of [seventy-five dollars] ONE

 a mandatory surcharge equal to the greater of [seventy-five dollars] ONE
 HUNDRED  TWELVE  DOLLARS  AND  FIFTY  CENTS or [six] NINE percent of any

 rendered by a town or a village justice court, the clerk of  such  court
 shall  pay  twenty-five  dollars  of  such surcharge to the chief fiscal
 officer of the town or village in the case of surcharges resulting  from
 paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision  and  ten  dollars  in the case of

 § 71-0301. Summary abatement.
  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provisions  of  law,  whenever the
 commissioner finds, after investigation, that  any  person  is  causing,
 engaging  in  or maintaining a condition or activity which, in his judg-
 ment, presents an imminent danger to the health or welfare of the people
 of the state or results in or is likely to  result  in  irreversible  or
 irreparable  damage  to natural resources, and relates to the prevention
 and abatement powers of the commissioner and it therefore appears to  be
 S. 7086  3
 
 prejudicial  to the interests of the people of the state to delay action
 until an opportunity for a hearing can  be  provided,  the  commissioner
 may,  without  prior  hearing,  order  such person by notice, in writing
 wherever  practicable  or  in  such  other form as in the commissioner's
 judgment will reasonably notify such person whose practices are intended
 to be proscribed, to discontinue, abate or alleviate such  condition  or
 activity, and thereupon such person shall immediately discontinue, abate
 or  alleviate such condition or activity. As promptly as possible there-
 after, not to exceed fifteen days, the commissioner  shall  provide  the
 person  an opportunity to be heard and to present proof that such condi-
 tion or activity does not violate the provisions of this section.  The
 commissioner  shall  adopt  any  other appropriate rules and regulations
 prescribing the procedure to be followed in the issuance of such orders.
 Any person who violates any of  the  provisions  of,  or  who  fails  to
 perform  any  duty  imposed  by this section, or any rule, regulation or
 order promulgated by the commissioner hereunder, shall be  liable  to  a
 civil  penalty  of  not  more  than [twenty-five hundred] THREE THOUSAND
 SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY dollars for each such violation  and  an  additional
 penalty of not more than [five] SEVEN hundred FIFTY dollars for each day
 during  which  such  violation continues, and, in addition thereto, such
 person may be enjoined from continuing  such  violation.  Penalties  and
 injunctive  relief  provided  herein  shall  be recoverable in an action
 brought by the attorney general at the request and in the  name  of  the
 commissioner.
  §  5.  Subdivisions  3  and  4 of section 71-0507 of the environmental
 conservation law, subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 400 of the laws of

 with the conservation fund in the manner provided by section 99-a of the
 State Finance Law. The balance of all other such moneys after payment of
 lawful  fees  shall be credited by the Comptroller to the [general fund]

 of the provisions of this chapter listed in section 71-0501 and titles 5
 S. 7086  4

 eof  shall be paid by the department to the Commissioner of Taxation and
 Finance and credited to the  conservation  fund.  All  other  moneys  so

 imposed by any provision thereof shall be guilty of  a  violation,  and,
 upon  conviction,  shall  be  punished  by  a fine of not more than [two
 hundred fifty] THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE dollars,  or  by  imprisonment

  With respect to the penalty for violation of subdivision 4 of  section

 S. 7086  5

 established  by  clear and convincing evidence, that when such defendant
 committed the violation, he or she had cause to believe  that  the  land
 was  his  or  her own, or that he or she had an easement or right of way
 across such land which permitted such action, damages shall  be  awarded
 on  the  basis of the stumpage value of such tree or trees in the market
 as if they were privately owned.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this
 section  shall  not  be  construed to authorize the cutting of timber or
 removal of trees where such action would otherwise be violative  of  any
 provision of the state constitution or law.

 tree or treble damages or both, based on the stumpage value of such tree

 lished  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence,  that  when such defendant
 committed the violation, he or she had cause to believe  that  the  land
 was  his  or  her  own or that he or she had an easement or right of way
 across such land which permitted such action, damages shall  be  awarded
 on  the basis of the stumpage value of such tree or trees. Notwithstand-
 ing the foregoing, this section shall not be construed to authorize  the
 cutting  of timber or removal of trees where such action would otherwise
 be violative of any provision of the state constitution or law.
  (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "stumpage value" shall mean  the
 current  fair  market  value of a tree as it stands prior to the time of
 sale, cutting, or removal. Stumpage value shall be determined by one  or
 more  of  the following methods: the sale price of the tree in an arm's-
 length sale, a review of  solicited  bids,  the  stumpage  price  report
 prepared  by  the  department  of environmental conservation, comparison
 with like sales on trees on state or private lands, or other appropriate
 means to assure that a  fair  market  value  is  established  within  an
 acceptable range based on the appropriate geographic area.
  9. a. Any person who transports, sells, imports or introduces invasive
 species, in violation of the regulations promulgated pursuant to section
 9-1709 of this chapter shall be subject to the following:
  For  any  first  violation  in lieu of a penalty there may be issued a
 written warning by the department and there may also be issued education

 section 9-1709 of this chapter, shall be subject to a fine of  not  less
 than  [six] NINE hundred dollars upon the first penalty. Upon the second
 penalty such person shall be subject to a fine of not  less  than  [two]
 THREE thousand dollars. Upon a subsequent penalty and after a hearing or
 opportunity  to  be  heard  upon  due notice the following penalties may
 apply: (i) such nursery grower may be subject to the  revocation  proce-
 dures  of  section  one  hundred  sixty-three-c  of  the agriculture and

 permit or order issued pursuant thereto, shall be liable to  the  people
 of the state for a civil penalty of not to exceed [eleven] SIXTEEN thou-
 sand  FIVE  HUNDRED  dollars  for  every such violation, to be assessed,
 after a hearing or opportunity to be heard upon due notice and with  the
 rights  to specification of the charges and representation by counsel at
 such hearing, by the commissioner or local government or  in  an  action
 initiated  by  the  attorney general pursuant to section 71-2305 of this
 title or on the attorney general's own initiative. Each violation  shall
 be  a  separate  and distinct violation and, in the case of a continuing

 distinct violation. Such penalty assessed by the commissioner  or  local
 government may be recovered in an action brought by the attorney general
 at  the  request and in the name of the commissioner or local government
 in any court of  competent  jurisdiction.  Such  civil  penalty  may  be
 released  or  compromised by the commissioner or local government before
 the matter has been referred to the attorney  general;  and  where  such
 matter  has  been referred to the attorney general, any such penalty may
 be released or compromised and any action commenced to recover the  same
 may be settled and discontinued by the attorney general with the consent
 of  the  commissioner or local government. In addition, the commissioner
 or local government shall  have  power,  following  a  hearing  held  in
 conformance  with  the  procedures  set forth in section 71-1709 of this
 article, to direct the violator  to  cease  violating  the  act  and  to
 restore  the  affected  freshwater wetland to its condition prior to the
 violation, insofar as that is possible  within  a  reasonable  time  and
 under  the supervision of the commissioner or local government. Any such
 order of the commissioner or local government shall be enforceable in an
 action brought by the attorney general at the request and in the name of
 the commissioner or local government in any court of competent jurisdic-
 tion. Any civil penalty or order issued by  the  commissioner  or  local
 government  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be  reviewable  in a
 proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil  practice  law
 and rules.
  b. Upon determining that significant damage to the functions and bene-
 fits  of a freshwater wetland is occurring or is imminent as a result of
 any violation of article twenty-four of this chapter, including but  not
 limited  to  (i)  activity taking place requiring a permit under article
 twenty-four of this chapter but for which no permit has been granted  or
 (ii)  failure on the part of a permittee to adhere to permit conditions,
 the commissioner or local government shall  have  power  to  direct  the
 violator  to  cease and desist from violating the act. In such cases the
 violator shall be provided an opportunity to be heard within ten days of
 receipt of the notice to cease and desist.
