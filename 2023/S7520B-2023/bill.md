  BACKGROUND: The  proposed  legislation  would  apply  to  TRS  members
 currently  employed  by  the  New York City Department of Education, who
 were employed by the City of Yonkers Parks  Department  for  the  period
 beginning in 2009 and ending in 2014 and did not join the New York State
 and Local Employees' Retirement System during such employment.
  Under  this  proposed  legislation, such members would receive service
 credit in TRS for their employment with the Yonkers Parks Department and
 would be granted retroactive Tier 4 membership. A change from Tier 6  to
 Tier  4 would result in an earlier date of retirement eligibility, lower
 overall employee contribution rates, and a larger benefit.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it was assumed that members will
 get a refund of past Tier 6 contributions that exceeded their applicable
 Tier 4 contribution rate, net of the amount required for the purchase of
 their prior service with the City of Yonkers Parks Department.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits). This Fiscal Note does not reflect any  chapter
 laws that may have been enacted during the current legislative session.
