  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  Matthew  DeTi-
 beriis,  who  is  currently  employed by the New York city department of
 education and a member of the New York city teachers' retirement system,
 and who was employed by the city of Yonkers  parks  department  for  the
 period  beginning  in  2009 and ending in 2014, and who, for reasons not
 ascribable to his own negligence, failed to become a member of  the  New
 York state and local employees' retirement system during such employment
 with  the  city  of  Yonkers  parks department in 2009, shall be granted
 service credit in the New York city teachers' retirement system for  his
 employment  with  the  city  of  Yonkers parks department for the period
 beginning in 2009 and ending in 2014 and shall be granted Tier IV status
 in such retirement system, provided that an application  is  filed  with
 the  head  of  the  New York city teachers' retirement system within one
 year from the effective date of this act.
  § 2. All past service costs associated with the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by the city of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would permit Matthew  DeTi-
 beriis,  an  active Tier 6 member of the New York City Teachers' Retire-
 ment System (TRS), to purchase service with the Yonkers Parks Department
 and to elect, by filing an application with TRS within one year  of  the
 effective date, retroactive membership in the Tier 4 TRS 55/27 Plan.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7520  2
 
  BACKGROUND:  Mr. DeTiberiis is currently employed by the New York City
 Department of Education. He joined TRS in September 2016  as  a  Tier  6
 member.  Previously he was employed by the City of Yonkers Parks Depart-
 ment from September 18, 2009 through February 28, 2014.
  The proposed legislation would allow Mr. DeTiberiis to receive service
 credit  in  TRS for his employment with the Yonkers Parks Department and
 apply for a Tier 4 membership with a refund of past Tier 6 contributions
 that exceed the applicable Tier 4 contribution rate. A change from  Tier
 6  to  Tier 4 would result in an earlier date of retirement eligibility,
 lower overall prospective employee contribution rates, a larger benefit,
 and a three-year (as opposed to a five-year) final average salary.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: The estimated financial  impact  of
 this  proposed  legislation  has been calculated based on the difference
 between (1) the present value of benefits Mr. DeTiberiis  would  receive
 if  the  Tier 4 55/27 Plan were elected and (2) the present value of the
 benefits Mr. DeTiberiis would receive under the Tier 6 63/5 Plan.
  Based on the actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  and
 assuming  that  Mr.  DeTiberiis timely elects the Tier 4 55/27 Plan, the
 enactment of this proposed legislation would increase the Present  Value
 of  Future  Benefits  (PVFB)  by  approximately $61,700 and decrease the
 Present Value of member contributions by approximately $63,000,  result-
 ing in an increase in the present value of future employer contributions
 of approximately $124,700.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to TRS, there would be an increase in the Unfunded Accrued
 Liability (UAL) of approximately $42,300 and an increase in the  present
 value of future employer Normal Cost of approximately $82,400.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions  of approximately $10,100 which is the result of
 an increase in the Normal Cost in addition to the UAL payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining  working lifetime for Mr.  DeTiberiis is approximately 20
 years and the increase in UAL was therefore  amortized  over  a  20-year
 period  (19  payments  under  the  One-Year Lag Methodology) using level
 dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: As of June 30, 2022, Mr. DeTiberiis was approximately age
 35, had approximately six years of service, and a salary of approximate-
 ly $85,300.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of TRS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2023  actuarial
 valuation  of  TRS  used  to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2025.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the  impacted  group,  and  other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.

  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
