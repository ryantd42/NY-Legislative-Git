  WHEREAS,  YES Community Counseling Center provides assistance to all
those in need regardless of income or socio-economic status; and
 
  WHEREAS, With locations in Massapequa and Levittown, New  York,  YES

perimeters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  YES financial literacy program, Commerce Plaza, has served
5,000 students annually throughout Long Island since 2000;  in  addition

  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the center's efforts to expand and create  new
initiatives  has  always been predicated upon the needs of its community
members; YES  has  provided  support  during  times  of  greatest  need,
including  after the tragedies of 9/11, Superstorm Sandy, and throughout
the COVID-19 pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS, YES Community  Counseling  Center  has  sought  to  develop
initiatives  that  are  innovative and address the gaps in resources and
support for those most in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recent years,  YES  has  partnered  with  youth  serving
organizations,  local  school  districts,  universities and colleges, as
well as community sectors, in  an  effort  to  build  our  capacity  and
improve outcomes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  45-year  history,  YES Community
Counseling Center has demonstrated continuous service to  the  residents
and communities which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of YES Community Counseling Center is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its dedicated staff, whose involvement is,
and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
