  COMMENDING  the  Village  of New Hartford upon the
  occasion of being designated as a Tree City USA  for
  the  40th consecutive year by the National Arbor Day
  Foundation
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those  towns  and villages of true purpose and high achievement
whose exemplary programs  and  accomplishments  clearly  demonstrate  an
enduring  pursuit of excellence in local government in this noble Empire
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend  the  Village  of  New  Hartford  upon  the  occasion  of  being
designated  as  a  Tree  City  USA  for the 40th consecutive year by the
National  Arbor  Day  Foundation,  to  be  celebrated  at  an  event  on
Wednesday, June 14, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tree City USA program recognizes the importance of an
urban tree canopy and improved care of vital village trees; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Village of New Hartford has once  again  achieved  Tree
City  USA  status  by  meeting  the  four  core standards of sound urban
forestry management: a tree board or department, a tree care  ordinance,
an  annual  community  forestry budget or at least $2 per capita, and an
Arbor Day observance and proclamation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1976, this four-step  framework  allows  for
communities  to  show environmental change is part of their communities'
commitment; currently, all 50 states have Tree City  programs  which  is
the oldest of the Arbor Day Foundations' programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  community's  tree  planting is a living memorial to the
citizens' concern for the quality of life; the trees we plant  and  care
for  today  will increase property values, cool and beautify our cities,
fight pollution, conserve energy, and give wildlife a home for years  to
come; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trees are essential for life; they improve water quality by
absorbing 25-35 percent of rainfall and controlling flooding better than
a  man-made  system,  restricting  stormwater  runoff  from reaching our
waterways, and filtering heavy metals and other pollutants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trees enhance air quality by lowering outdoor temperatures,
which reduces energy consumption and the pollution it creates; capturing
carbon emissions that lead to climate change, a single tree  removes  22
pounds of carbon per year; and absorbing hundreds of thousands of metric
tons of air pollution a year and replacing it with oxygen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trees build vibrant neighborhoods by inviting neighbors to
go  outdoors  and  connect  with  one  another;  reducing  instances  of
vandalism,  graffiti  and  littering;  lowering  crime rates and acts of
aggression; and growing a sense of community; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  An  effective  community  forestry  program  is an ongoing
process of renewal and improvement, a program of tree planting and  care
which  continues  through  the  years;  the  Tree  City  USA award is an
excellent indication that there is a solid foundation for  that  process
of improvement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is incumbent upon all citizens to recognize and applaud
the efforts of local governments such as the  Village  of  New  Hartford
which  work  tirelessly on behalf of protecting our natural surroundings
for the benefit of present and future generations of New  Yorkers;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  the  Village  of  New  Hartford  upon  the  occasion  of  being
designated  as  a  Tree  City  USA  for the 40th consecutive year by the
National Arbor Day Foundation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Village of New Hartford.
