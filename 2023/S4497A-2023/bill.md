  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 HIGHER  IN RESPIRATORY THERAPY OR IN A PROGRAM DETERMINED BY THE DEPART-
 MENT TO BE THE EQUIVALENT WITHIN  SIX  YEARS  OF  INITIAL  LICENSURE  IN

 DISCRETION, MAY ISSUE A CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION TO A LICENSEE WHO FAILS
 TO COMPLETE THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE BUT WHO AGREES TO  MEET  THE  ADDI-
 TIONAL  REQUIREMENT  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR.  THE  FEE FOR SUCH A CONDITIONAL
 REGISTRATION SHALL BE THE SAME AS, AND IN ADDITION TO, THE FEE  FOR  THE
 TRIENNIAL  REGISTRATION.  THE  DURATION OF SUCH CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION
 SHALL BE FOR ONE YEAR AND MAY BE EXTENDED, WITH THE PAYMENT  OF  A  FEE,
 FOR NO MORE THAN ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR, UNLESS THE APPLICANT CAN SHOW GOOD
 CAUSE  FOR NON-COMPLIANCE ACCEPTABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT.  THE DEPARTMENT,
 IN ITS DISCRETION, MAY ISSUE A  TEMPORARY  EDUCATIONAL  EXEMPTION  TO  A
 LICENSEE  WHO  IS  UNABLE  TO COMPLETE THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE DUE TO A
 LACK OF ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. LICENSEES  SEEKING  A  TEMPORARY
 EDUCATIONAL EXEMPTION SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF APPLYING ON AT LEAST TWO
 OCCASIONS TO A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAM OR PROGRAMS AND SUBSEQUENTLY

 TIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND WHO PRACTICES AS A LICENSED  RESPIRATORY  THERA-
 PIST  WITHOUT  SUCH  REGISTRATION  MAY  BE  SUBJECT  TO  DISCIPLINARY

 TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  § 3.  The provisions of this act shall not apply to:
