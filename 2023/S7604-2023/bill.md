 Introduced  by Sen. BORRELLO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT prohibiting the public use of cannabis, unless  approved  by  the
  applicable local government
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that cannabis has
 been legalized for personal use in New York state. Smoking  cannabis  in
 public  places  can  be disruptive and harmful to non-smokers. Fines for
 smoking tobacco in public places have been effective in reducing  public
 smoking  rates  and fines for smoking cannabis in public places can help
 enforce public health and safety regulations while reducing  the  burden
 on law enforcement agencies.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, smok-
 ing  or using cannabis in any public place, including but not limited to
 streets, sidewalks, parks, and outdoor patios of restaurants  and  bars,
 shall  be  prohibited,  unless  designated for cannabis use by the local
 government.
  § 3. Any person found to be in violation of the provisions of  section
 two  of  this  act shall be subject to a fine of one hundred twenty-five
 dollars, to  be  paid  to  the  local  government  where  the  violation
 occurred, within thirty days of receiving such violation.
  §  4.  The  cannabis  control board, in conjunction with local govern-
 ments, shall establish regulations and guidelines for the implementation
 and enforcement of this act, including but not limited to the definition
 of a public place and the designation of areas for cannabis use.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
