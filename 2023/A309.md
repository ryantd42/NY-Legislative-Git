 AN ACT in relation to directing the state board  of  real  property  tax

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. For purposes of this act, the term "real property tax satu-
 ration"  shall be considered a broad term that encompasses the impact of
 high percentages of tax exempt real property within  a  municipality  on
 the overall economic viability of the municipality.
  §  2.  The state board of real property tax services is authorized and
 directed to conduct a study on real property tax saturation. Such  study
 shall include, but not be limited to:
  (a)  the  percentage  of real property within each county of the state
 that is exempt from real property taxation;
  (b) an examination of each county within the top twentieth  percentile
 of  all counties for the highest percentage of real property exempt from
 taxation, such examination to include the impact  of  such  exempt  real
 property over the five year period preceding the study on:
  (i) the housing market in such counties, including new construction;
  (ii) the growth or loss of new small businesses in such counties;
  (iii) the growth or loss of new jobs in such counties;
  (iv) the population growth or loss of such counties;
  (v)  the  number  of  tax  exempt not-for-profit organizations in such
 counties;
  (vi) the percentage of dedicated park land in such counties;
  (vii) any other information the board deems appropriate;
  (c) feasible revisions to real property tax policies,  procedures  and
 practices that have the potential to reduce the tax burden in properties
 within such counties that are subject to real property taxation; and

  (d)  strategies  that  will  support an equitable distribution of real
 property taxation within such counties.
  §  3.  Such  board  shall  make a report of the findings of its study,
 including any recommendations for legislative  action  as  it  may  deem
 necessary  and appropriate. Such report shall be delivered to the gover-
 nor, the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assem-
 bly no later than one year after the effective date of this act.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed two years after such effective date, or upon delivery of
 the report required by section three of this act, whichever comes first;
 provided  that  the board of real property tax services shall notify the
 legislative  bill  drafting  commission  upon  delivery  of  the  report
 required  by  section three of this act in order that the commission may
 maintain an accurate and timely effective database of the official  text
 of  the  laws  of  state  of New York in furtherance of effectuating the
 provisions of section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of  the
 public officers law.
