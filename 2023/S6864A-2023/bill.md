  (5)  members  with  wages  greater than one hundred thousand per annum
 shall contribute six per centum of annual wages.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during each of  the  first  three  plan
 years  (January first to December thirty-first) in which such member has
 established membership in the Board of Higher Education Optional Retire-
 ment Program, such employee shall contribute a percent of  annual  wages
 in  accordance  with  the  preceding schedule based upon a projection of
 annual wages provided by the employer.
  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS
 PARAGRAPH, THE RATE OF CONTRIBUTION FOR MEMBERS WITH TEN OR  MORE  YEARS
 OF MEMBERSHIP SHALL BE THREE PER CENTUM OF ANNUAL WAGES.
  §  8. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be subject to section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
 S. 6864--A  10
 
  §  9. No  employee contributions made by a member of a public retire-
 ment system prior to the effective date of this act shall be refunded as
 a result of this act becoming a law.
  § 10. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  decrease  the member contribution rate to three (3)
 percent for Tier 5 uniformed court officers and peace  officers  in  the
 unified court system (UCPO) and all Tier 6 members of the New York State
 and  Local  Retirement System (NYSLRS) with ten or more years of member-
 ship, effective April 1, 2024. The current member contribution rate  for
 a Tier 5 UCPO is four (4) percent, regardless of membership tenure.  The
 current member contribution rate for Tier 6 members is variable, depend-
 ing  on  annual  compensation,  between  three  (3)  percent and six (6)
 percent, regardless of membership tenure. There will  be  no  refund  of
 member contributions.
  It  is  anticipated that this proposal will not become law until after
 the effective date of April 1, 2024, in which case  member  contribution
 rates will need to be revised retroactively. This will result in signif-
 icant administrative costs to the NYSLRS and its more than 3,000 partic-
 ipating employers.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by  the
 State  of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLERS.
 If this bill were enacted  during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  the
 increase  in  the  present  value of future costs would be approximately
 $2.73 billion.
 
  Increase in  Increase in
 NYSLERS  Present Value of  Required
  Future Costs  Contributions
 
 Tiers 1 - 5  $0.003 billion  $0.42 billion
 Tier 6  $2.73 billion  $2.31 billion
 Total  $2.73 billion  $2.73 billion
 
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to all participating employers to  cover  retrospec-
 tive  benefit  increases  and  (2) increasing the Tier 5 UCPO and Tier 6
 billing rates charged annually to cover prospective  benefit  increases,
 as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  we anticipate an increase in the
 billing rates charged annually to all participating employers by approx-
 imately 0.3% of salary, beginning with the fiscal year ending March  31,
 2026.
  (2)  To  fund  prospective costs, there would be a further increase in
 the annual billing rate for any Tier 5 UCPO by 0.4%  of  salary  (for  a
 0.7% total annual rate increase) and further increase the annual billing
 rates  for  all  Tier  6 members in the NYSLERS by 1.2% of salary (for a
 1.5% total annual rate increase) beginning with the fiscal  year  ending
 March 31, 2026. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing  cycles  with changes in the billing rate and salary of the affected
 members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 S. 6864--A  11
 
 the increase in the present value of future costs would be approximately
 $555 million.
 
  Increase in  Increase in
 NYSLPFRS  Present Value of  Required
  Future Costs  Contributions
 
 Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $45 million
 Tier 6  $555 million  $510 million
 Total  $555 million  $555 million
 
  In  the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) bill-
 ing a past service cost to all participating employers to  cover  retro-
 spective  benefit  increases and (2) increasing the Tier 6 billing rates
 charged annually to cover prospective benefit increases, as follows:
  (1) To fund retrospective costs, we  anticipate  an  increase  in  the
 billing rates charged annually to all participating employers by approx-
 imately  0.2% of salary, beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31,
 2026.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, there would be a  further  increase  in
 the  annual  billing rate for all Tier 6 members in the NYSLPFRS by 1.6%
 of salary (for a 1.8% total annual rate  increase)  beginning  with  the
 fiscal  year ending March 31, 2026. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary
 in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary
 of the affected members.
  These estimated costs are based on 265,829 Tier  5  UCPO  and  Tier  6
 members  with  annual salary of approximately $12 billion in the NYSLERS
 and 16,538 Tier 6 members  with  annual  salary  of  approximately  $1.5
 billion in the NYSLPFRS, as of March 31, 2023.

  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 1, 2024, and intended for use  only  during
 the  2024  Legislative  Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-95, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would  amend Section 613 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
 to reduce the required employee contribution  rate  for  Tier  5  and  6
 members who have attained ten or more years of membership to a flat 3.0%
 of  salary, payable over the remainder of their careers. Currently, Tier
 S. 6864--A  12
 
 5 members are required to contribute at a rate of 3.5%  of  salary,  and
 Tier 6 members are required to contribute between 3.0% and 6.0% of sala-
 ry,  according  to a salary-based schedule. No contributions made before
 the  effective date of this bill would be refunded. This change would be
 effective on April 1, 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System for this benefit is estimated to be $134.9
 million or 0.70% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture. This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost  of
 Tier  6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed change
 to the Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new  entrant  rate
 is estimated to increase to 6.26% of pay, an increase of 0.95% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be  found  in  the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June 30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuarial  assump-
 tions  and  methods  are  provided  in  the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.

 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2024
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the

  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Currently, Tier 6 members of NYCERS,
 TRS, and BERS are required to  make  Basic  Member  Contributions  (BMC)
 ranging from 3% to 6% depending on the members' applicable annual wages.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation, the required BMC would be a flat 3%
 upon attaining 10  years  of  service,  effective  April  1,  2024.  The
 required  BMCs  prior  to  attaining  10  years  of service would remain
 unchanged.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 S. 6864--A  14
 
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
