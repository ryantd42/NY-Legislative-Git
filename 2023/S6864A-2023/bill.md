 in  accordance  with  the  preceding schedule based upon a projection of
 annual wages provided by the employer.
  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS
 PARAGRAPH, THE RATE OF CONTRIBUTION FOR MEMBERS WITH TEN OR  MORE  YEARS
 OF MEMBERSHIP SHALL BE THREE PER CENTUM OF ANNUAL WAGES.
  §  8. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be subject to section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  §  9. No  employee contributions made by a member of a public retire-
 ment system prior to the effective date of this act shall be refunded as
 a result of this act becoming a law.
  § 10. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would change the member contribution rate to 3% for  Tier  5
 uniformed  court  peace  officers  (UCPOs) and Tier 6 members of the New
 S. 6864  10
 
 York State and Local Retirement System after ten  years  of  membership.
 Tier  5  UCPOs currently pay 4% and Tier 6 members currently pay a vari-
 able percentage between 3% and  6%  depending  on  annual  compensation.
 There will be no return of member contributions.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), increased costs  would  be  shared  by  the
 State  of  New  York  and all participating employers in the NYSLERS. If
 enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there will be  an  increase
 in the present value of future costs of approximately $2.49 billion.
  In  the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 Tier 6 billing rates 1.2% of salary and increasing Tier 5  UCPO  billing
 rates  0.4%  of  salary,  resulting  in  additional annual contributions
 beginning in the fiscal year ending March  31,  2025,  of  approximately
 $109  million to the State of New York and approximately $141 million to
 local participating employers in NYSLERS. THE ANNUAL COST WILL  INCREASE
 as  Tier  6  salary  grows and will vary by employer based upon the plan
 coverage and salary reported in Tier 6 and Tier 5 UCPO.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS), increased costs would be shared by
 the State of New York and all participating employers in  the  NYSLPFRS.
 If  enacted  during  the  2023  legislative  session,  there  will be an
 increase in the present value of  future  costs  of  approximately  $470
 million.
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 Tier  6  billing  rates  1.6%  of salary, resulting in additional annual
 contributions beginning in the fiscal year ending  March  31,  2025,  of
 approximately  $7 million to the State of New York and approximately $28
 million to local participating employers in NYSLPFRS.  THE  ANNUAL  COST
 WILL  INCREASE  as  Tier  6 salary grows and will vary by employer based
 upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate, dated April 17, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-113,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As  it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, this
 bill would amend Section 613 of the Retirement and Social  Security  Law
 to  reduce  the  required  employee  contribution  rate for Tier 5 and 6
 members who have attained ten or more years of membership to a flat 3.0%
 S. 6864  11

 of salary, payable over their career.  Currently,  Tier  5  members  are
 required  to  contribute at a rate of 3.5% of salary, and Tier 6 members
 are required to contribute between 3.0% and 6.0% of salary, according to
 a salary-based schedule. No contributions made before the effective date
 of  this bill would be refunded. This change would be effective on April
 1, 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System for this benefit is estimated to be $104.9
 million or 0.57% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 assets, is equal to 5.15% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the reduction to the
 Tier 6 employee contribution rate proposed under  this  bill,  this  new
 entrant  rate  would  increase  to 6.10% of pay, an increase of 0.95% of
 pay.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.

 2023 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2023
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to  the  New
 York  City  Retirement  Systems  and  Pension Funds (NYCRS), would amend
 Section 613 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL)  to  reduce
 the  Basic  Member Contribution (BMC) rate to 3% upon attaining 10 years
 of service for Tier 6 members of the New York City Employees' Retirement
 System (NYCERS), the New York City Teachers' Retirement System (NYCTRS),
 and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System (BERS).
  Effective Date: April 1, 2024.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Currently, Tier 6 members  of  NYCERS,
 NYCTRS, and BERS are required to make BMCs ranging from 3% to 6% depend-
 ing  on the members' applicable annual wages.  Under the proposed legis-
 lation, if enacted, the required BMCs would be a flat 3% upon  attaining
 10  years  of  service,  starting  on the effective date of the proposed
 legislation. The required BMCs prior to attaining 10  years  of  service
 would remain unchanged.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  Based on the census data and the actuarial assump-
 tions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of  this  proposed
 legislation  would result in an initial increase in the present value of
 future employer contributions of approximately $1.2 billion for  NYCERS,
 $1.6 billion for NYCTRS, and $0.1 billion for BERS, resulting in a total
 increase  of approximately $2.9 billion for NYCRS for the current active
 members.
 S. 6864  12
 
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  population
 increases  over  time.  The  estimate of the increase in annual employer
 contributions for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the  table
 below.
 
  Increase in Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
 
 Fiscal  NYCERS  NYCTRS  BERS  TOTAL
 Year
 
 2024  $109.2  $107.6  $10.2  $227.0*
 2025  $119.8  $116.7  $11.1  $247.6
 2026  $130.9  $126.2  $12.0  $269.1
 2027  $142.6  $136.1  $13.0  $291.7
 2028  $154.8  $146.5  $14.0  $315.3

  *  The  increase in the employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2024 is
 estimated to be $166.3 million for New York City and $60.7  million  for
 the other obligors of NYCRS.
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted  by  the  benefit  changes.  The remaining working lifetime for
 impacted Tier 6 members is approximately 16 years for those  in  NYCERS,
 20 years for those in NYCTRS, and 14 years for those in BERS.
  The  increase in UAL for NYCERS was therefore amortized over a 16-year
 period (15 payments under the  One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level
 dollar  payments. Under the same methodology the increase in the UAL for
 NYCTRS and BERS was amortized over 19 and 13 payments, respectively.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuations of NYCERS, NYCTRS,
 and BERS to determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contrib-
 utions.
  The table below contains a summary of the census data for active  Tier
 6 members in NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS as of June 30, 2022.
 
 NYCRS  Active  Average  Average  Average
  Count  Age  Service  Salary
 NYCERS  77,127  41.9  4.2  $76,100
 NYCTRS  56,614  37.5  4.6  $77,000
 BERS  12,264  46.3  3.7  $53,100
 
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of  NYCERS,
 NYCTRS, and BERS.
  New  entrants  were projected to replace the members expected to leave
 the active population to maintain a steady-state population. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuations of NYCERS,  NYCTRS,  and  BERS  used  to  determine  employer
 contributions for Fiscal Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 S. 6864  13
 
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  Pension  costs for future members of NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS hired
 on or after 7/1/2026.
