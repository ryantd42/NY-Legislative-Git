  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subdivision (f) of section 1115 of  the  tax
 law,  as  amended  by  section  1 of part W of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  (1) Services rendered by a veterinarian  licensed  and  registered  as
 required  by  the education law which constitute the practice of veteri-
 nary medicine as defined in  said  law,  including  hospitalization  for
 [which no separate boarding charge is made], shall not be subject to tax
 under paragraph [(3)] THREE of subdivision (c) of section eleven hundred
 five,  but  the exemption allowed by this subdivision shall not apply to
 other services provided by a veterinarian to  pets  and  other  animals,
 including,  but not limited to, [boarding,] grooming and clipping. Arti-
 cles of tangible personal property  designed  for  use  in  some  manner
 relating to domestic animals or poultry, when sold by such a veterinari-
 an,  shall not be subject to tax under subdivision (a) of section eleven
 hundred five or under section eleven hundred ten. However, the  sale  of
 any  such articles of tangible personal property to a veterinarian shall
 not be deemed a sale for resale within the meaning  of  paragraph  [(4)]
 FOUR  of  subdivision (b) of section eleven hundred one and shall not be
 exempt from retail sales tax.
  § 2. Section 1115 of the tax law is amended by adding a  new  subdivi-
 sion (f-1) to read as follows:
  (F-1)  SERVICES PROVIDED TO BOARD AN ANIMAL WHEN RENDERED BY A VETERI-
 NARIAN LICENSED AND REGISTERED AS REQUIRED BY THE EDUCATION LAW OR BY  A
