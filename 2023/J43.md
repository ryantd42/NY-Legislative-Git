  COMMEMORATING  the  20th  Anniversary  of  Cafe
  Domenico of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
individuals and businesses that  are  devoted  to  the  welfare  of  the
community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize
and  commend  those who work to better their local community and to keep
local traditions alive; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 20th Anniversary of Cafe Domenico of Utica, New York, to
be celebrated on Friday, July 22, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2002, Kim and Orin Domenico, who grew up  in  the  Utica
area, established Cafe Domenico in an effort to create a refuge from the
fast paced world while promoting creative expression and the casual joys
of face-to-face conversation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Cafe  Domenico  is  a  cozy  cafe  full  of books,
upholstered chairs and lamps you might find in your  living  room;  jazz
songs  from its owners' extensive music collection drown out the hissing
noises of the coffee machine and the chatter of its countless  customers
who  have  made  this  remarkable  space  a  true  hub for art and human
connections; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, on display is  a  20-year  collection  of  the
cafe's beloved regulars, both human and furry, as well as paintings from
talented  customers,  family  portraits,  jazz  and blues records, and a
community bulletin; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a steadfast and unwavering  commitment  to  the  local
community,  Cafe  Domenico  continues  to  support  other  area  small
businesses, serving bagels  from  Bagel  Grove,  pastries  from  Karam's
Bakery,  and  brewing  its  coffee  from  organic producers like Mayorga
Coffee; additionally, together  with  other  agencies,  the  cafe  helps
foster local arts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2008, when the space next door to Cafe Domenico became
available, Kim and Orin Domenico created The  Other  Side,  a  nonprofit
organization  and  space  to  host  poetry events, art exhibits and live
music; the couple also started Doubly Mad: Utica's  Independent  Journal
of  Arts  and  Ideas, a publication to promote literacy and visual arts;
and
 
  WHEREAS, For 20 years, Cafe Domenico has offered its loyal customers
the finest quality coffee, espresso, foods and products, and the highest
standards of service while remaining a gathering place for young and old
 
alike and retaining the same old-time charm which has  so  characterized
its past; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 20th Anniversary of Cafe Domenico; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Kim and Orin Domenico, Cafe Domenico, Utica, New York.
