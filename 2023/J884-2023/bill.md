at the age of 59; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A native Baldwinite, Joseph Scannell, affectionately known

attending  its  schools,  becoming involved in scouting and representing
the Town of Hempstead hamlet as a Nassau County legislator; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joseph Scannell was born on May 17, 1962, in Manhattan, New
York; he and his family moved to Long Island, and after graduating  from
Baldwin High School, he earned his bachelor's degree from C.W. Post, now

  WHEREAS,  Joseph  Scannell  furthered his education by obtaining his
law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1989,  before  going

  WHEREAS,  A  decade  later,  Joseph  Scannell  ran  for  the  County
Legislature for the first time, and enjoyed a  seven-term  career  there
from  January  of  2000 to July of 2013; he then became the attorney for
the Village of Hempstead's Community Development Association; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joseph Scannell truly lived a life of service, beginning as
an Eagle Scout, and ending with his role with the Community  Development
Association; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  he  was  not  working  or  helping  someone  in  his
community, Joseph Scannell enjoyed spending time with his loving wife of
42 years, Merrill and his cherished children, Brittany and Brian; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joseph Scannell's  infinite  selflessness  and  benevolence
will shine on through his family's vivid and happy memories; his insight
and  strength  will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope to
the countless lives he touched; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Joseph  Scannell  leaves  behind  a  legacy which will long
endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
 
who were privileged to have known and loved such an amazing man; he will
be  deeply  missed  and  truly  merits  the  grateful  tribute  of  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
