  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Wildfire Safety Awareness Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
environmental  disasters  that  affect the lives of citizens of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Wildfire
Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Wildfire Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Wildfire  Awareness  Month  dedicates the entire
month of May to increasing prevention  and  preparedness  for  wildfires
throughout the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to the National Interagency Fire Center, humans
cause an average of 68% of fires per year in the United States; of those
human-started  fires,  2.8  million  acres  burn  each  year;  in  2018,
8,767,492 acres burned due to human-started fires and lightning strikes;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  steps to take to prevent wildfires; from using
fire resisting building materials to following the safety protocols  for
handling  fire  when camping, heating your home or storing fuel, all New
Yorkers can take part in reducing wildfires; and
 
  WHEREAS, While wildfires may not be prevalent in  every  state,  the
responsibility  to be aware and alert belongs to everyone; the causes of
wildfires can occur in every state, and as mobile as our lifestyles have
become, everyone needs to be prepared; and
 
  WHEREAS, Before a wildfire,  purchase  a  battery-powered  radio  to
receive  information  from local authorities during a power outage; find
an outdoor water source such as a pond, well, even a swimming pool,  and
have  a  hose  that  can  reach  any  area  of  your  property; create a
fire-resistant zone free of leaves, debris or flammable materials for at
least 30 feet out from your home; regularly  clean  roofs  and  gutters;
make sure driveway entrances and your house number are clearly marked so
fire  vehicles can get to your home; designate a room that can be closed
off from outside air; close all doors and windows; set up a portable air
cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist;
use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate  or  make  repairs;  and
post  emergency phone numbers by every phone in your house and make sure
everyone has those numbers in their cell phones; and
 
  WHEREAS, If you have to leave  your  neighborhood,  be  prepared  to
evacuate  at  a  moment's  notice  and  obey  all evacuation orders from
officials; also, shut all windows and doors and remove flammable  window
shades,  curtains  and close metal shutters; move flammable furniture to
 
the center of the room, away from windows and doors; shut off gas at the
meter, turn off pilot lights, shut off the air conditioning;  gather  up
flammable  items  from  the  exterior of the house and bring them inside
(patio  furniture,  toys,  trash  cans); turn off propane tanks and move
propane BBQ appliances away from structures; do not leave sprinklers  on
or  water  running,  they  can affect critical water pressure; back your
loaded car into the driveway and keep  all  doors  and  windows  closed;
ensure  your  emergency supplies kit is in your vehicle; and locate your
pets and take them with you; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  both
the  prevention  and preparedness of wildfires, and more must be done to
increase  activity  at  the  local,  State  and  National  levels;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Wildfire
Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be if further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
