 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to the  establishment  of
  the interagency task force on health literacy
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. 1. It is the intent of the  legislature
 to  improve  health  care  access  and  outcomes, and reduce unnecessary
 health care spending by addressing the issue of health literacy.  Health
 literacy  is the degree to which an individual, or individuals, have the
 capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health care information
 and services necessary for them to make appropriate health decisions.
  2. A patient's health literacy may be affected if they have low educa-
 tion skills, cultural  barriers  to  seeking  health  care,  or  limited
 English  proficiency  (LEP).  Demographically, individuals with health
 literacy challenges often  are  represented  disproportionately  in  the
 following  groups:  older adults, minority and/or immigrant populations,
 lower-income populations, and medically underserved populations.
  3. Although New York has some existing  health  literacy  initiatives,
 the  legislature  finds  that  a comprehensive statewide health literacy
 task force is a necessary and valuable step toward eliminating  as  much
 as  practicable  the  negative  outcomes that health literacy challenges
 create in the state.
  § 2. The education law is amended by adding a  new  section  238-b  to
 read as follows:
  § 238-B. INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON HEALTH LITERACY. 1. THERE IS HEREBY
 ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, AN INTERAGENCY TASK
 FORCE  ON HEALTH LITERACY TO BE ADMINISTERED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS
 OF THIS SECTION. SUCH TASK FORCE  SHALL  ASSIST  THE  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN
 SERVICE  AGENCIES OF THIS STATE IN STUDYING HEALTH LITERACY AND DEVELOP-
 ING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING HEALTH LITERACY IN THIS STATE.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
