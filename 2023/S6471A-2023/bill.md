  §  3.  Section 380.20 of the criminal procedure law is amended to read
 as follows:
 § 380.20 Sentence required.
  1. The court must pronounce sentence in every case where a  conviction

 conviction is entered on more than one count the  court  must  pronounce
 sentence on each count.
  2.  WHEN  ENTERING A SENTENCE THAT INCLUDES A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT, OR
 WITHIN SEVEN DAYS THEREAFTER, THE COURT SHALL ISSUE A  WRITTEN  DECISION
 EXPLAINING  ITS  CHOICE  OF  SENTENCE, BASED ON INDIVIDUALIZED FINDINGS,
 SUFFICIENT TO FACILITATE APPELLATE REVIEW. A DEFENDANT MAY KNOWINGLY AND
 VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A WRITTEN DECISION.
  § 4. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section 390.30 of the  criminal
 procedure law, as added by chapter 14 of the laws of 1985, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a) The report of the pre-sentence investigation must contain an anal-
 ysis  of as much of the information gathered in the investigation as the
 agency that conducted the investigation deems relevant to  the  question
 of sentence. The report must also include any other [imformation] INFOR-
 MATION  that  the court directs to be included and the material required
 by paragraph (b) of this subdivision which shall be considered  part  of
 the  report.  THE REPORT SHALL INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL FINAN-
 CIAL COST OF INCARCERATION TO THE STATE AND/OR LOCALITIES OF THE  POTEN-
 TIAL SENTENCES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED.
  §  5.  Subdivision  1  and  paragraph  (a) of subdivision 2 of section
 390.50 of the  criminal  procedure  law,  subdivision  1  as  separately
 amended by chapters 224 and 369 of the laws of 1986 and paragraph (a) of
 subdivision  2 as amended by chapter 31 of the laws of 2019, are amended
 to read as follows:
  1. In general. Any pre-sentence report or memorandum submitted to  the
 court  pursuant  to  this article and any medical, psychiatric or social
 agency report or other information gathered for the court by a probation
 department, or submitted directly to the court, in connection  with  the
 question  of  sentence  is confidential and may not be made available BY
 ANY STATE AGENCY, INCLUDING THE  STATE  DEPARTMENT  OF  CORRECTIONS  AND
 COMMUNITY  SUPERVISION, to any person or public or private agency except
 where specifically required or permitted by  statute  or  upon  specific
 authorization  of  the  court.  SECTION  ONE  HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN OF THE
 CORRECTION LAW SHALL NOT  BE  DEEMED  TO  PERMIT  SUCH  DISCLOSURE.  For
 purposes  of  this  section, any report, memorandum or other information
 forwarded to a probation department within this state from  a  probation
 agency outside this state is governed by the same rules of confidential-
 ity.  Any  person, public or private agency receiving such material must
 retain it under the same conditions of confidentiality as apply  to  the
 probation department that made it available.
  (a)  Not less than one court day prior to sentencing, unless such time
 requirement is waived by the parties, the pre-sentence report  or  memo-
 randum  shall  be  made  available  by the court for examination and for
 copying  AND  RETENTION  by  the  defendant's  attorney,  the  defendant
 himself,  [if  he  has  no  attorney,] and the prosecutor. THE DEFENDANT
 SHALL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY  TO  CHALLENGE  OR  CORRECT  ANY  FACT  OR
 CONCLUSION IN THE PRE-SENTENCE REPORT OR MEMORANDUM PRIOR TO THE COURT'S
 PRONOUNCEMENT  OF SENTENCE. In its discretion, the court may except from
 S. 6471--A  3
 
 disclosure a part or parts of the report  or  memoranda  which  are  not
 relevant to a proper sentence, or a diagnostic opinion which might seri-
 ously  disrupt  a  program  of rehabilitation, or sources of information
 which  have  been obtained on a promise of confidentiality, or any other
 portion thereof, disclosure of which would not be  in  the  interest  of
 justice.  In  all cases where a part or parts of the report or memoranda
 are not disclosed, the court shall state for the record that a  part  or
 parts  of the report or memoranda have been excepted and the reasons for
 its action. The action of the court excepting information  from  disclo-
 sure shall be subject to appellate review. The pre-sentence report shall
 be made available by the court for examination and copying in connection
 with any appeal in the case, including an appeal under this subdivision.
 Upon  written  request,  the  court shall make a copy of the presentence
 report, other than a part or parts of the report redacted by  the  court
 pursuant  to  this  paragraph, available to the defendant for use before
 the parole board for release consideration or  an  appeal  of  a  parole
 board  determination  or  an  application  for  resentencing pursuant to
 section 440.46 or 440.47 of this chapter. [In his or her written request
 to the court the defendant shall affirm that he or  she  anticipates  an
 appearance  before the parole board or intends to file an administrative
 appeal of a parole board determination or meets the eligibility criteria
 for and intends to file a motion for resentencing pursuant to 440.46  of
 this  chapter or has received notification from the court which received
 his or her request to apply for resentencing pursuant to section  440.47
 of  this  chapter  confirming  that  he  or she is eligible to submit an
 application for resentencing pursuant to section 440.47  of  this  chap-
 ter.]  The court shall respond to the defendant's written request within
 twenty days from receipt of the defendant's written request.
  § 6. Section 70.00 of the penal law, the section heading as amended by
 chapter 277 of the laws of 1973, subdivision 1 as amended by  chapter  7
 of  the  laws of 2007, subdivisions 2, 3 and 4 as amended by chapter 738
 of the laws of 2004, paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 as amended by  chap-
 ter  107 and paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 746 of
 the laws of 2006, subdivision 5 as amended by section 40-a of  part  WWW
 of chapter 59 of the laws of 2017, and subdivision 6 as amended by chap-
 ter 1 of the laws of 1998, is amended to read as follows:
 § 70.00 Sentence of imprisonment for felony.
  1.  Indeterminate  sentence.  Except as provided in subdivisions THREE
 AND four[, five and six] of this section or section 70.80 of this  arti-
 cle, [a] THE TERM OF sentence [of imprisonment] for a felony, other than
 a  felony  defined in article two hundred twenty [or two hundred twenty-
 one] of this chapter, shall be FIXED BY THE COURT. IF A COURT FINDS THAT
 SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR IS THE  MINIMUM  TERM  OF
 IMPRISONMENT  NECESSARY  TO  ACHIEVE  THE GOALS OF SENTENCING, THE COURT
 SHALL IMPOSE an indeterminate sentence. When such a sentence is imposed,
 the court shall impose a maximum term in accordance with the  provisions
 of  subdivision two of this section [and the minimum period of imprison-
 ment shall be as provided in subdivision three of this  section].  THE
 MINIMUM PERIOD SHALL BE FIXED BY THE COURT AND SPECIFIED IN THE SENTENCE
 AND SHALL BE NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR NOR MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE MAXI-
 MUM  TERM IMPOSED, OR THE COURT MAY IMPOSE A DEFINITE SENTENCE OF IMPRI-
 SONMENT AND FIX A TERM OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.
  2. Maximum term of sentence. The  maximum  term  of  an  indeterminate
 sentence  shall  be  at least three years and the term shall be fixed as
 follows:
  (a) For a class A felony, the term shall be life imprisonment;
 S. 6471--A  4
 
  (b) For a class B felony, the term shall be fixed by  the  court,  and
 shall not exceed twenty-five years;
  (c)  For  a  class C felony, the term shall be fixed by the court, and
 shall not exceed fifteen years;
  (d) For a class D felony, the term shall be fixed by  the  court,  and
 shall not exceed seven years; and
  (e)  For  a  class E felony, the term shall be fixed by the court, and
 shall not exceed four years.
  3. [Minimum period of imprisonment. The minimum period of imprisonment
 under an indeterminate sentence shall be at least one year and shall  be
 fixed as follows:
  (a) In the case of a class A felony, the minimum period shall be fixed
 by the court and specified in the sentence.
  (i) For a class A-I felony, such minimum period shall not be less than
 fifteen  years  nor more than twenty-five years; provided, however, that
 (A) where a sentence, other than a sentence of death or  life  imprison-
 ment  without parole, is imposed upon a defendant convicted of murder in
 the first degree as defined in section 125.27 of this chapter such mini-
 mum period shall be not less than twenty years nor more than twenty-five
 years, and, (B) where a sentence is imposed upon a  defendant  convicted
 of murder in the second degree as defined in subdivision five of section
 125.25  of  this chapter or convicted of aggravated murder as defined in
 section 125.26 of this chapter, the sentence shall be life  imprisonment
 without  parole,  and,  (C) where a sentence is imposed upon a defendant
 convicted of attempted murder in the first degree as defined in  article
 one  hundred  ten of this chapter and subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of
 paragraph (a) of subdivision one and paragraph (b) of subdivision one of
 section 125.27 of this chapter or attempted aggravated murder as defined
 in article one hundred ten of this chapter and section  125.26  of  this
 chapter such minimum period shall be not less than twenty years nor more
 than forty years.
  (ii)  For  a  class A-II felony, such minimum period shall not be less
 than three years nor more than eight years four months, except that  for
 the  class A-II felony of predatory sexual assault as defined in section
 130.95 of this chapter or the class  A-II  felony  of  predatory  sexual
 assault  against  a  child as defined in section 130.96 of this chapter,
 such minimum period shall be not less than ten years nor more than twen-
 ty-five years.
  (b) For any other felony, the minimum period shall  be  fixed  by  the
 court  and specified in the sentence and shall be not less than one year
 nor more than one-third of the maximum term imposed.
  4. Alternative definite sentence for class D and E  felonies.  When  a
 person,  other than a second or persistent felony offender, is sentenced
 for a class D or class E felony, and the court,  having  regard  to  the
 nature  and  circumstances of the crime and to the history and character
 of the defendant, is of the opinion that a sentence of  imprisonment  is
 necessary  but  that it would be unduly harsh to impose an indeterminate
 or determinate sentence, the court may impose  a  definite  sentence  of
 imprisonment and fix a term of one year or less.
  5.]  Life  imprisonment  without  parole.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision of law, a defendant sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  without
 parole  shall  not  be  or  become  eligible  for  parole or conditional
 release. For purposes of commitment and custody, other than  parole  and
 conditional  release,  such sentence shall be deemed to be an indetermi-
 nate sentence. A defendant may be sentenced to life imprisonment without
 parole upon conviction for the crime of murder in the  first  degree  as
 S. 6471--A  5
 
 defined  in  section  125.27  of this chapter and in accordance with the
 procedures provided by law for imposing a sentence  for  such  crime.  A
 defendant  who  was  eighteen  years  of age or older at the time of the
 commission  of  the crime must be sentenced to life imprisonment without
 parole upon conviction for the crime of terrorism as defined in  section
 490.25  of  this  chapter,  where  the  specified  offense the defendant
 committed is a class A-I felony; the crime of criminal possession  of  a
 chemical  weapon  or biological weapon in the first degree as defined in
 section 490.45 of this chapter; or the crime of criminal use of a chemi-
 cal weapon or biological weapon  in  the  first  degree  as  defined  in
 section  490.55 of this chapter; provided, however, that nothing in this
 subdivision shall preclude or prevent  a  sentence  of  death  when  the
 defendant  is  also convicted of the crime of murder in the first degree
 as defined in section 125.27 of this chapter. A defendant who was seven-
 teen years of age or younger at the time of the commission of the  crime
 may  be  sentenced, in accordance with law, to the applicable indetermi-
 nate sentence with a maximum term of life imprisonment. A defendant must
 be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole upon conviction for the
 crime of murder in the second degree as defined in subdivision  five  of
 section  125.25 of this chapter or for the crime of aggravated murder as
 defined in subdivision one of section 125.26 of this chapter. A  defend-
 ant may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole upon conviction
 for  the  crime  of  aggravated  murder as defined in subdivision two of
 section 125.26 of this chapter.
  [6.] 4. Determinate sentence. [Except as provided in subdivision  four
 of  this  section  and subdivisions two and four of section 70.02, when]
 WHEN a person is sentenced as a  violent  felony  offender  pursuant  to
 section  70.02  [or  as  a  second  violent  felony offender pursuant to
 section 70.04 or as a second felony  offender  on  a  conviction  for  a
 violent  felony  offense pursuant to section 70.06] OF THIS ARTICLE, the
 SENTENCE SHALL BE FIXED BY THE court. IF A COURT FINDS THAT  A  SENTENCE
 OF  IMPRISONMENT  OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR IS THE MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISON-
 MENT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF SENTENCING, THE COURT must impose
 a determinate sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions
 of such [sections and such sentence shall include, as a part thereof,  a
 period  of  post-release  supervision  in accordance with section 70.45]
 SECTION.
  § 7. Subdivision d of section 74 of chapter 3 of  the  laws  of  1995,

 OF SENTENCING, THE COURT SHALL IMPOSE A DETERMINATE SENTENCE as follows:
  (a)  For  a class B felony, the term must be at least [five years] ONE
 YEAR and must not exceed twenty-five years, provided, however, that  the

  2-b. When a person is convicted of a violent felony offense  committed
 after  arraignment  and  while  released  on  recognizance  or bail, but
 committed prior to the  imposition  of  sentence  on  a  pending  felony
 charge,  and if an indeterminate or determinate sentence of imprisonment
 is imposed  in  each  case,  such  sentences  shall  run  consecutively.
 Provided, however, that the court may, in the interest of justice, order
 a  sentence  to  run  concurrently  in  a  situation  where  consecutive
 sentences are required by this subdivision if it finds either mitigating
 circumstances that bear directly upon the manner in which the crime  was
 committed  or,  where  the defendant was not the sole participant in the
 crime, the defendant's participation was relatively minor  although  not
 so  minor  as  to constitute a defense to the prosecution. The defendant
 and the district attorney shall have an opportunity to present  relevant
 information  to  assist  the  court in making this determination and the
 court may, in its discretion, conduct a  hearing  with  respect  to  any
 issue  bearing  upon  such  determination.  If the court determines that
 consecutive sentences should not be ordered, it shall make  a  statement
 on  the  record  of the facts and circumstances upon which such determi-
 nation is based.
  2-c. When a person is convicted of bail jumping in the  second  degree

 information  charging  one or more felonies, at least one of which he is
 subsequently convicted, and if an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment
 is  imposed  in  each  case,  such  sentences  shall  run consecutively.
 Provided, however, that the court may, in the interest of justice, order
 a  sentence  to  run  concurrently  in  a  situation  where  consecutive
 sentences  are  required  by  this  subdivision  if  it finds mitigating
 circumstances that bear directly upon the manner in which the crime  was
 committed.  The defendant and the district attorney shall have an oppor-
 tunity to present relevant information to assist  the  court  in  making
 this determination and the court may, in its discretion, conduct a hear-
 ing  with  respect  to any issue bearing upon such determination. If the
 court determines that consecutive sentences should not  be  ordered,  it
 shall make a statement on the record of the facts and circumstances upon
 which such determination is based.
  2-d.  When  a  person  is  convicted of escape in the second degree as
 defined in section 205.10 or escape in the first degree  as  defined  in
 section  205.15 committed after issuance of a securing order, as defined
 in subdivision five of section 500.10 of the criminal procedure law,  in
 connection with a pending indictment or information charging one or more
 felonies,  at least one of which he is subsequently convicted, and if an
 indeterminate sentence of imprisonment is imposed  in  each  case,  such
 sentences  shall  run  consecutively.  Provided, however, that the court
 may, in the interest of justice, order a sentence to run concurrently in
 a situation where consecutive sentences are required by this subdivision
 if it finds mitigating circumstances that bear directly upon the  manner
 in  which the crime was committed. The defendant and the district attor-
 ney shall have an opportunity to present relevant information to  assist
 the  court  in  making  this  determination  and  the  court may, in its

 such  determination.  If the court determines that consecutive sentences
 should not be ordered, it shall make a statement on the  record  of  the
 facts and circumstances upon which such determination is based.

 in  section  130.80 and any other crime under article one hundred thirty
 committed against the same child and within  the  period  charged  under
 section 130.75 or 130.80, the sentences must run concurrently.
  [2-f.]  2-B.  Whenever  a  person  is  convicted of facilitating a sex
 offense with a controlled substance as defined in section 130.90 of this
 chapter, the sentence imposed by the  court  for  such  offense  may  be

  3.  Where  consecutive  definite  sentences  of  imprisonment  are not
 prohibited by subdivision two of this  section  and  are  imposed  on  a
 person  for  offenses which were committed as parts of a single incident
 or transaction, the aggregate of the terms of such sentences  shall  not
 exceed one year.
  4. When a person, who is subject to any undischarged term of imprison-
 ment  imposed  at a previous time by a court of another jurisdiction, is
 sentenced to an additional term or terms of imprisonment by a  court  of
 this  state,  the  sentence  or  sentences  imposed by the court of this
 state, subject to the provisions of subdivisions one, two and  three  of
 this  section,  shall  run  either  concurrently  or  consecutively with
 respect to such undischarged term in such manner as the court directs at
 the time of sentence. If the court of this state does  not  specify  the
 manner  in  which  a  sentence  imposed by it is to run, the sentence or
 sentences shall run [consecutively] CONCURRENTLY.
  [5. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subdivision,  when
 a  person  is  convicted  of assault in the second degree, as defined in
 subdivision seven of section 120.05 of this chapter, any definite, inde-
 terminate or determinate term of imprisonment which may be imposed as  a
 sentence  upon  such  conviction  shall run consecutively to any undisc-
 harged term of imprisonment to which the defendant was subject  and  for
 which he was confined at the time of the assault.
  (b)  Except  as  provided in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, when a
 person is convicted of assault in  the  second  degree,  as  defined  in
 subdivision seven of section 120.05 of this chapter, any definite, inde-
 terminate  or determinate term of imprisonment which may be imposed as a
 sentence upon such conviction shall run consecutively  to  any  term  of
 imprisonment  which was previously imposed or which may be prospectively
 imposed where the person was confined within a detention facility at the
 time of the assault upon a charge which culminated in such  sentence  of
 imprisonment.
  (c)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
 subdivision, a term of imprisonment imposed upon a conviction to assault
 in the second degree as defined in subdivision seven of  section  120.05
 of  this chapter may run concurrently to any other term of imprisonment,
 in the interest of justice, provided the court sets forth in the  record
 its  reasons for imposing a concurrent sentence. Nothing in this section
 shall require the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment where  it  is
 not otherwise required by law.]
  §  14.  Paragraphs  (a) and (f) of subdivision 1 and the opening para-
 graph of subdivision 3 of section 70.30 of the penal law, paragraph  (a)
 of  subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 3 of the laws of 1995, paragraph
 (f) of subdivision 1 as added by chapter 481 of the laws of 1978 and  as
 relettered  by  chapter 3 of the laws of 1995, and the opening paragraph
 of subdivision 3 as amended by chapter  1  of  the  laws  of  1998,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) If the sentences run concurrently, the time served under imprison-
 ment  on  any of the sentences shall be credited against the minimum AND
 MAXIMUM periods  of  all  the  concurrent  indeterminate  sentences  and
 against the terms of all the concurrent determinate sentences. The maxi-
 mum  term  or terms of the indeterminate sentences and the term or terms
 of the  determinate  sentences  shall  merge  in  and  be  satisfied  by
 discharge of the term which has the longest unexpired time to run;
  (f) The aggregate maximum term of consecutive sentences imposed upon a
 juvenile  offender for two or more crimes, not including a class A felo-
 ny, committed before he has reached the age of  sixteen,  shall,  if  it
 S. 6471--A  11
 
 exceeds  ten years, be deemed to be ten years. If consecutive indetermi-
 nate sentences imposed upon a juvenile offender include a  sentence  for
 the class A felony of arson in the first degree or for the class A felo-
 ny of kidnapping in the first degree, then the aggregate maximum term of
 such  sentences  shall,  if  it  exceeds  fifteen years, be deemed to be
 fifteen years. Where the aggregate maximum term of two or  more  consec-
 utive  sentences is reduced by a calculation made pursuant to this para-
 graph, the aggregate minimum  period  of  imprisonment,  if  it  exceeds
 [one-half]  ONE-THIRD of the aggregate maximum term as so reduced, shall
 be deemed to be [one-half] ONE-THIRD of the aggregate maximum term as so
 reduced.
  The term of a definite sentence, a determinate sentence, or the  maxi-
 mum term of an indeterminate sentence imposed on a person shall be cred-
 ited  with  and  diminished  by  the  amount of time the person spent in
 custody prior to the commencement of such sentence as a result of  [the]
 ANY  PENDING charge [that culminated in the sentence]. In the case of an
 indeterminate sentence, if the minimum period of imprisonment  has  been
 fixed  by  the court or by the board of parole, the credit shall also be
 applied against the minimum period. The credit herein provided shall  be
 calculated  from the date custody under the charge commenced to the date
 the sentence commences and shall not include any time that  is  credited
 against  the  term or maximum term of any previously imposed sentence or
 period of post-release supervision  to  which  the  person  is  subject.
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WHEN A PERSON IS SUBJECT TO AN UNDISCHARGED TERM
 OF  IMPRISONMENT  OR  POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION FOLLOWING PAROLE RELEASE,
 PRESUMPTIVE  RELEASE  OR  CONDITIONAL  RELEASE  FROM  AN  INDETERMINATE
 SENTENCE,  OR CONDITIONAL RELEASE OR MAXIMUM EXPIRATION OF A DETERMINATE
 SENTENCE, AND IS HELD IN PRETRIAL CUSTODY IN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACIL-
 ITY ON A NEW CHARGE OR CHARGES THAT CULMINATE  IN  AN  INDETERMINATE  OR
 DETERMINATE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT, THE TIME SPENT IN PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY IN
 A  LOCAL  CORRECTIONAL FACILITY ON SUCH CHARGE OR CHARGES, FROM THE DATE
 CUSTODY COMMENCED TO  THE  DATE  OF  COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  SUBSEQUENTLY
 IMPOSED INDETERMINATE OR DETERMINATE SENTENCE, SHALL BE CREDITED AS JAIL
 TIME;  AND  PROVIDED  FURTHER  THAT  WHEN  JAIL TIME IS CREDITED IN SUCH
 MANNER THE TIME SPENT IN PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY SHALL NOT BE CREDITED TO  THE
 PREVIOUSLY  IMPOSED  SENTENCE  TO WHICH THE PERSON IS SUBJECT. Where the
 charge or charges culminate in more than one sentence, the credit  shall
 be applied as follows:
  §  15.  Section  10  of  chapter 339 of the laws of 1972, amending the
 correction law and the  penal  law  relating  to  inmate  work  release,

 the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 10. This act shall take effect 30 days after it shall have become  a
 law  [and];  PROVIDED  THAT SECTIONS ONE THROUGH EIGHT OF THIS ACT shall
 remain in effect until September 1, 2025[,]; and provided  further  that
 the  commissioner  of  correctional  services  shall report each January
 first, and July first, to the chairman  of  the  senate  crime  victims,
 crime and correction committee, the senate codes committee, the assembly
 correction  committee,  and  the assembly codes committee, the number of
 eligible [inmates] INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS in each facility  under  the
 custody  and  control  of  the commissioner who have applied for partic-
 ipation in any program offered under the  provisions  of  work  release,

 read as follows:
 §  70.35 Merger  of  certain  definite  and indeterminate or determinate
  sentences.
  The service of an indeterminate or determinate sentence  of  imprison-
 ment  shall  satisfy  any definite sentence of imprisonment imposed on a
 person for an offense committed prior to the time the  indeterminate  or
 determinate  sentence  was imposed, [except as provided in paragraph (b)
 of subdivision five of section 70.25 of this article]. A person  who  is
 serving  a definite sentence at the time an indeterminate or determinate
 sentence is imposed shall be delivered  to  the  custody  of  the  state
 department  of corrections and community supervision to commence service
 of the indeterminate or determinate  sentence  immediately  [unless  the
 person  is  serving  a  definite  sentence  pursuant to paragraph (b) of
 subdivision five of section 70.25 of this article]. In  any  case  where
 the  indeterminate  or  determinate  sentence is revoked or vacated, the
 person shall receive credit against the definite sentence for  each  day
 spent in the custody of the state department of corrections and communi-
 ty supervision.

 by chapter 738 of the laws of 2004, paragraphs (a) and (b)  of  subdivi-
 S. 6471--A  15

 sion 1 and paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision 2 as amended by chapter
 92 of the laws of 2021, subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivision
 2  as  amended by section 21 and paragraph (d) of subdivision 2 as added
 by section 23 of part AAA of chapter 56 of the laws of 2009, are amended
 to read as follows:
  1. For the purposes of this section, [the following terms shall mean:
  (a)  "Felony]  "FELONY  drug  offender"  means  a defendant who stands
 convicted of any felony, defined in article two hundred  twenty  or  two
 hundred twenty-two of this chapter other than a class A felony.
  [(b)  "Second  felony drug offender" means a second felony offender as
 that term is defined in subdivision one of section 70.06 of  this  arti-
 cle,  who stands convicted of any felony, defined in article two hundred
 twenty or two hundred twenty-two of this chapter other than  a  class  A
 felony.
  (c)  "Violent  felony"  shall  have  the  same meaning as that term is
 defined in subdivision one of section 70.02 of this article.]
  2. [Except as provided in subdivision three or four of  this  section,
 a]  (A)  TERM  OF SENTENCE. THE TERM OF sentence [of imprisonment] for a
 felony drug offender shall be FIXED BY THE COURT. THE COURT MAY IMPOSE A
 DEFINITE SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT AND FIX A TERM OF LESS THAN ONE  YEAR.
 IF  A  COURT FINDS THAT A SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR
 IS THE MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE  THE  GOALS  OF
 SENTENCING, THE COURT SHALL IMPOSE a determinate sentence as provided in
 paragraph [(a)] (B) of this subdivision.
  [(a)]  (B)  Term of determinate sentence. [Except as provided in para-
 graph (b) or (c) of this subdivision, the court shall impose a] A deter-
 minate term of imprisonment [upon a felony drug offender which] shall be
 imposed by the court in whole or half years, which shall  include  as  a
 part  thereof  a  period  of post-release supervision in accordance with
 section 70.45 of this article. The terms of imprisonment authorized  for
 such determinate sentences are as follows:
  (i)  for  a  class  B felony, the term shall [be at least one year and
 shall] not exceed nine years[, except that for the  class  B  felony  of
 criminal  sale  of  a  controlled substance in or near school grounds as
 defined in subdivision two of section 220.44 of this  chapter  or  on  a
 school bus as defined in subdivision seventeen of section 220.00 of this
 chapter or criminal sale of a controlled substance to a child as defined
 in  section 220.48 of this chapter, the term shall be at least two years
 and shall not exceed nine years];
  (ii) for a class C felony, the term shall [be at least  one  year  and
 shall] not exceed five and one-half years;
  (iii)  for  a class D felony, the term shall [be at least one year and
 shall] not exceed two and one-half years; and

 provisions of sections 60.04 and 65.00 of this chapter.
  (c)  Alternative  definite sentence for class B, class C, class D, and
 class E felonies. If the court, having regard to the nature and  circum-
 stances  of the crime and to the history and character of the defendant,
 is of the opinion that a sentence of imprisonment is necessary but  that
 it  would be unduly harsh to impose a determinate sentence upon a person
 convicted of a class C, class D or class E  felony  offense  defined  in
 S. 6471--A  16

 article two hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-two of this chapter, or
 a  class B felony defined in article two hundred twenty of this chapter,

 as  added  by  a  chapter of the laws of two thousand nine the court may
 impose a definite sentence of imprisonment and fix a term of one year or
 less.
  (d) The court may direct that a  determinate  sentence  imposed  on  a
 defendant  convicted  of a class B felony, other than the class B felony
 defined in section 220.48 of this chapter, pursuant to this  subdivision
 be  executed  as  a  sentence  of  parole supervision in accordance with
 section 410.91 of the criminal procedure law.]

 § 65.05 Sentence of conditional discharge.
  1. [Criteria. (a) Except as otherwise required by section  60.05,  the
 court  may  impose a sentence of conditional discharge for an offense if
 the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the  offense

 opinion that neither the public interest nor the ends of  justice  would
 be  served  by a sentence of imprisonment and that probation supervision
 is not appropriate.
  (b) When a sentence of conditional discharge is imposed for a  felony,
 the court shall set forth in the record the reasons for its action.
  2.]  Sentence.  Except  to  the  extent authorized by paragraph (d) of
 subdivision two of section 60.01 of this [chapter] TITLE, when the court
 imposes a sentence of  conditional  discharge  the  defendant  shall  be
 released  with  respect  to  the  conviction  for  which the sentence is
 imposed without  imprisonment  or  probation  supervision  but  subject,
 during  the  period  of conditional discharge, to such conditions as the
 court may determine. The court shall impose the  period  of  conditional
 discharge  authorized  by  subdivision  [three]  TWO of this section and
 shall specify, in accordance with section 65.10  OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  the
 conditions to be complied with.  If a defendant is sentenced pursuant to

 provide  written notice to the court of any violation of program partic-
 ipation by the defendant. The court may modify or enlarge the conditions

 tion,  revoke the sentence at any time prior to the expiration or termi-
 nation of the period of conditional discharge.

  Where the court has required, as a condition of the sentence, that the
 defendant make restitution of the fruits of his or her offense  or  make
 reparation  for  the loss caused thereby and such condition has not been
 satisfied, the court, at any time prior to the expiration or termination
 S. 6471--A  30
 
 of the period of conditional discharge, may impose an additional period.
 The length of the additional period shall be fixed by the court  at  the
 time  it  is  imposed  and  shall not be more than two years. All of the
 incidents of the original sentence, including the authority of the court
 to modify or enlarge the conditions, shall continue to apply during such
 additional period.
  § 33. Section 65.20 of the penal law is amended to read as follows:
 § 65.20 Sentence of unconditional discharge.
  [1.  Criteria.  The  court  may  impose  a  sentence  of unconditional
 discharge in any case where it is authorized to  impose  a  sentence  of
 conditional discharge under section 65.05 if the court is of the opinion
 that  no  proper  purpose would be served by imposing any condition upon
 the defendant's release.
  When a sentence of unconditional discharge is imposed  for  a  felony,
 the court shall set forth in the record the reasons for its action.
  2.  Sentence.]  When  the  court  imposes  a sentence of unconditional
 discharge,  the  defendant  shall  be  released  with  respect  to  the
 conviction  for which the sentence is imposed without imprisonment, fine
 or probation supervision. A sentence of unconditional discharge  is  for
 all purposes a final judgment of conviction.

 S. 6471--A  34
 
 submit a subscribed memorandum setting forth: [(1)] (I) a recommendation
 that  the  interests  of  justice would best be served by removal of the
 action to the family court; and [(2)] (II) if the indictment  charges  a

 specific factors, one or more of which reasonably supports the recommen-
 dation,  showing,  [(i)] (1) mitigating circumstances that bear directly
 upon the manner in which the crime was committed, or  [(ii)]  (2)  where
 the  defendant  was  not  the  sole  participant  in the crime, that the

 family  court  act, regardless of the age of the offender at the time of
 commission of the act, that the criminal act was not part of  a  pattern
 of criminal behavior and, in view of the history of the offender, is not
 likely to be repeated.
  If  the court is of the opinion based on specific factors set forth in
 the district attorney's memorandum that the interests of  justice  would
 best  be  served by removal of the action to the family court, a plea of
 guilty of a crime or act for  which  the  defendant  is  not  criminally
 responsible may be entered pursuant to subdivision three or four of this
 section,  except  that  a  thirteen  year  old charged with the crime of
 murder in the second degree may only plead to a designated  felony  act,
 as  defined  in  subdivision  eight of section 301.2 of the family court
 act.
  Upon accepting any such plea, the court must specify upon  the  record
 the  portion  or portions of the district attorney's statement the court
 is relying upon as the basis of its opinion and  that  it  believes  the
 interests  of  justice would best be served by removal of the proceeding
 to the family court. Such plea shall then be deemed  to  be  a  juvenile
 delinquency  fact  determination  and  the court upon entry thereof must
 direct that the action be removed to the family court in accordance with
 the provisions of article seven hundred twenty-five of this chapter.
  [(g-1) Where a defendant is an adolescent offender, the provisions  of
 paragraphs  (a),  (b), (c) and (d) of this subdivision shall not apply.]
 5-A. Where the plea is to an offense  constituting  a  misdemeanor,  the
 plea  shall be deemed replaced by an order of fact-finding in a juvenile
 delinquency proceeding, pursuant to section 346.1 of  the  family  court
 act,  and  the action shall be removed to the family court in accordance
 with article seven hundred twenty-five of this chapter. Where  the  plea
 is  to an offense constituting a felony, the court may remove the action
 to the family court in accordance with section 722.23 and article  seven
 hundred twenty-five of this chapter.
  [(h) Where the indictment charges the class E felony offense of aggra-
 vated harassment of an employee by an incarcerated individual as defined
 in  section  240.32 of the penal law, then a plea of guilty must include
 at least a plea of guilty to a class E felony.]
  6. The defendant may, with both the permission of the  court  and  the
 consent  of  the  people,  enter  a plea of not responsible by reason of
 S. 6471--A  35
 
 mental disease or defect to the indictment in the manner  prescribed  in
 section 220.15 of this chapter.

 220.10 of the criminal procedure law, as amended by chapter  23  of  the
 laws of 2024, is amended to read as follows:

 [subparagraph (i)] PARAGRAPH (A) of this  [paragraph]  SUBDIVISION,  the
 district  attorney  may  recommend  removal  of the action to the family
 court. Upon making  such  recommendation  the  district  attorney  shall
 submit a subscribed memorandum setting forth: [(1)] (I) a recommendation
 that  the  interests  of  justice would best be served by removal of the
 action to the family court; and [(2)] (II) if the indictment  charges  a
 thirteen  year  old  with the crime of murder in the second degree, or a
 fourteen or fifteen year old with the crimes of rape in the first degree
 as defined in subdivision one of section 130.35 of  the  penal  law,  or
 criminal sexual act in the first degree as defined in subdivision one of
 section  130.50 of the penal law, or an armed felony as defined in para-
 graph (a) of subdivision forty-one  of  section  1.20  of  this  chapter
 specific factors, one or more of which reasonably supports the recommen-
 dation,  showing,  [(i)] (1) mitigating circumstances that bear directly
 upon the manner in which the crime was committed, or  [(ii)]  (2)  where
 the  defendant  was  not  the  sole  participant  in the crime, that the
 defendant's participation was relatively minor although not so minor  as
 to  constitute  a  defense  to  the prosecution, or [(iii)] (3) possible
 deficiencies in proof of the crime, or [(iv)]  (4)  where  the  juvenile
 offender  has no previous adjudications of having committed a designated
 felony act, as defined in subdivision eight  of  section  301.2  of  the
 family  court  act, regardless of the age of the offender at the time of
 commission of the act, that the criminal act was not part of  a  pattern
