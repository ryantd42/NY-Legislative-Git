  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title.  This act maybe known and cited as the "New
 York wildlife crossing act".
  § 2. For the purposes of this act:
  "Wildlife crossing" means  a  structure  designed  or  retrofitted  to
 enable  wildlife  to  successfully  cross  roads  and other human-caused
 barriers to wildlife movement.  Such crossings may include  but  not  be
 limited to culverts, bridges, wildlife underpass tunnels, wildlife over-
 pass bridges, and fencing associated with such structures.
  §  3.  The department of transportation and the New York state thruway
 authority is hereby authorized and  directed  to  assess  all  highways,
 thruways,  and parkways in the state for potential wildlife crossings to
 improve wildlife habitat connectivity, reduce  wildlife  vehicle  colli-
 sions, and increase public safety for New York motorists. The department
 of  transportation,  in  conjunction  with  the  New  York state thruway
 authority, shall use the findings of their assessment to finalize a  top
 ten  wildlife  crossings priority list no later than two years after the

 effective date of this act. The priority list of crossing sites shall be
 determined by the following:
  (a) (i) Identification of road segments that pose a risk to successful
 wildlife  movement  and habitat connectivity, or that pose a risk to the
 traveling public due to wildlife-vehicle collisions;
  (ii) Any available or subsequently collected data, or  recommendations
 provided by the department of environmental conservation, the department
 of  transportation, and the department of motor vehicles on needed road-
 way mitigation measures to improve wildlife movement and habitat connec-
 tivity.
  (b) Identification of bridges and culverts that block or impede, espe-
 cially road segments that negatively affect wildlife habitat  and  move-
 ment;
  (c)  Information about how increased movement of species could benefit
 overused and highly impacted habitat areas;
  (d) Maps that identify locations of:
  (i) existing wildlife crossings; and
  (ii) potential sites for additional wildlife crossings based  on  this
 study;
  (e)  Economic  benefits  anticipated from preserving wildlife movement
 patterns, including the potential  impact  of  reduced  wildlife-vehicle
 collisions;
  (f)  The feasibility and constructability of wildlife crossing infras-
 tructure; and
  (g) Any additional information that the  department  of  environmental
 conservation,  department of motor vehicles, and non-governmental organ-
 izations deems necessary and appropriate to carry  out  the  intent  and
 purposes of this act.
  § 4. Two years after the effective date of this act, the department of
 transportation  in conjunction with the New York state thruway authority
 shall shall make public its identified list of priority wildlife  cross-
 ing opportunities. The priority opportunity list and accompanying infor-
 mation  listed below shall be updated every five years after publication
 of the initial list. The publicized list of the top ten  priority  wild-
 life crossing opportunities shall be accompanied by the following infor-
 mation:
  (a) Feasibility factors impacting construction for the top five of the
 top ten wildlife crossing opportunities, which should include any avail-
 able and helpful estimate costs, the availability and habitat quality of
 the  land  on  either  side  of  the  crossings, and any relevant public
 support for the crossings;
  (b) A description of any methodologies used  beyond  the  requirements
 listed  in  subdivisions  (a)  and  (b)  of section three of this act to
 create the top ten list; and
  (c) A list of available federal grant funds that the top five projects
 are eligible for.
  § 5. The department of transportation may consult with  any  state  or
 local  office,  agency, or department and request or receive information
 from any such entity that is relevant and material to the completion  of
 this study and report.
  §  6.  The  department  of  transportation is hereby directed to addi-
 tionally update  appropriate  design  guidance,  including  the  Highway
 Design Manual, by July 1, 2026, to incorporate design concepts for wild-
 life  passage  features and related standard plans and specifications as
 appropriate.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately.
