 the laws of 1967, is amended to read as follows:
  § 506. Acquisition  of  property.  1.  [(a)]  A  municipality,  acting
 through  its  governing  body,  may  acquire  by purchase, gift, devise,
 lease, condemnation or otherwise, in accordance with the  provisions  of
 the appropriate general, special or local law applicable to the acquisi-
 tion  of real property by such municipality, real property or any inter-
 est therein, including but not limited to air rights, and  easements  or
 other  rights  of user necessary for the use and development of such air
 rights, to be developed as air rights sites for the elimination  of  the
 blighting  influences of an area or areas consisting principally of land
 in streets, alleys, highways, and other public rights of way, railway or
 subway tracks, bridge or tunnel approaches or entrances, or other  simi-
 lar facilities which have a blighting influence on the surrounding area,
 necessary  for  or incidental to a program of urban renewal for residen-
 tial, commercial, industrial, public, semi-public,  community  or  other
 uses  or  combinations  of such uses in accordance with an urban renewal
 plan for a designated area, or for a  part  or  portion  of  such  area,
 provided,  however, that the acquisition of any air rights over railroad

 A. 1490  3
 
 subject to the provision of section fifty-one-a of the railroad law. The
 acquisition of real property within  a  designated  urban  renewal  area
 shall  in  every case be deemed to be and constitute a continuous rather
 than separate takings.
  [(b)]  2.  Property so acquired by a municipality shall be exempt from

 or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this arti-
 cle  of this chapter; provided however, that any such municipality shall
 have the power and authority, with respect to such property, to  pay  or
 transfer,  out  of  funds  available  to it for the effectuating of such
 urban renewal program, annual sums in lieu of taxes to any taxing juris-
 diction providing services to the urban renewal area, or to the part  or
 portion  thereof  within such taxing jurisdiction, in order that no such
 taxing jurisdiction shall suffer  an  inequitable  loss  of  revenue  by
 virtue of such urban renewal program; provided, further, that the amount
 so  paid  or  transferred for any year with respect to any such property
 shall not exceed the lesser of [(1)]: (A) the sum last  levied  for  the
 benefit  of  such  taxing jurisdiction as an annual tax on such property
 prior to the time of its acquisition  for  urban  renewal  purposes;  or
 [(2)] (B) such amount as shall be approved by the commissioner, pursuant
 to  such  rules,  regulations,  limitations  and  conditions  as  he may
 prescribe, as an eligible and proper charge against such  urban  renewal
 program.  Upon  the  sale,  lease or disposition of such property to any
 person, firm or corporation not entitled to an exemption  from  taxation
 or  entitled  to  only a partial tax exemption such property shall imme-
 diately become subject to taxation in whole or in part, as the case  may
 be, and shall be taxed pro rata for the unexpired portion of the taxable
 year.
  As  used  in  this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION, the term "taxing jurisdic-
 tion" means any municipal corporation or district corporation, including
 any school district or any special district, having the power to levy or
 collect taxes and benefit assessments upon real property,  or  in  whose
 behalf such taxes or benefit assessments may be levied or collected.
  [c.]  3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, a muni-
 cipality may acquire by purchase, gift, devise, lease,  condemnation  or
 otherwise,  upon recommendation of the agency and in accordance with the
 appropriate provisions of any general, special or local law  or  charter
 applicable  to  the  acquisition  of real property by such municipality,
 such real property or any interest therein, within  an  area  designated
 pursuant  to  this  article  as appropriate for urban renewal, as it may
 deem ultimately necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes  of  this
 article  although  temporarily  not required for such purposes, provided
 that the early acquisition of such property is approved as follows:
  [(1)] (A) In a municipality where there is a planning commission,  the
 agency shall submit the proposal for early acquisition to the commission
 for  its  approval.  Such  planning commission shall, not later than ten
 weeks from the date of the referral of  the  proposal  to  it,  after  a
 public  hearing held on [due notice] TEN DAYS' NOTICE, submit its report
 to the governing body certifying its  unqualified  consent,  its  disap-
 proval,  or its qualified consent with recommendations for modifications
 of the proposal.
  After public hearing held on [due notice] TEN DAYS' NOTICE  after  the
 report  is  received  or due from the planning commission, the governing
 body may:
  (i) if the commission shall have certified  its  unqualified  consent,
 approve the proposal by a majority vote:

  (ii)  if  the commission shall have certified its disapproval or shall
 have failed to make its report within  ten  weeks  from  the  date  such
 proposal  was  submitted  to  it by the agency, nevertheless approve the

 sion  by a majority vote, or approve the proposal without such modifica-
 tions but only by a three-fourths vote.

 (c) of subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 247 of the laws of  1970  and

 subway tracks, bridge or tunnel approaches or entrances, or other  simi-
 lar  facilities which have a blighting influence on the surrounding area
 necessary for or incidental to any urban renewal program or part thereof
 in accordance with an urban renewal plan may be acquired by an agency by
 gift, grant, devise, purchase, condemnation or otherwise and by a  muni-
 cipality  for  and on behalf of an agency by condemnation.  Property may
 be acquired by condemnation by an agency or by  a  municipality  for  an
 agency pursuant to the condemnation law or pursuant to the laws relating
 to  the condemnation of land by the municipality for which the agency is
 acting or the municipality, as the case may be.
  [(b)] 2. Property so acquired by an agency, or by  a  municipality  in
 behalf  of  an  agency, shall be exempt from taxation until sold, leased

 this chapter; provided, however, that any such  agency  shall  have  the

 available  to  it  for  the  effectuating of such urban renewal program,
 annual sums in lieu  of  taxes  to  any  taxing  jurisdiction  providing
 services  to  the  urban renewal area, or to the part or portion thereof
 within such taxing jurisdiction, in order that no such taxing  jurisdic-
 tion shall suffer an inequitable loss of revenue by virtue of such urban
 renewal program; provided, further, that the amount so paid for any year
 with  respect to any such property shall not exceed the lesser of [(1)]:
 (A) the sum last levied for the benefit of such taxing  jurisdiction  as

 urban renewal purposes; or [(2)] (B) such amount as shall be approved by
 the commissioner, pursuant to such rules,  regulation,  limitations  and
 conditions as he may prescribe, as an eligible and proper charge against
 such  urban renewal program. Upon the sale, lease or disposition of such
 property to any person, firm or corporation not entitled to an exemption

 from taxation or entitled to only a partial tax exemption such  property
 shall immediately become subject to taxation in whole or in part, as the
 case  may  be,  and shall be taxed pro rata for the unexpired portion of
 the taxable year.
  As  used  in  this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION, the term "taxing jurisdic-
 tion" means any municipal corporation or district corporation  including
 any school district or any special district, having the power to levy or

 weeks  from  the  date  of  the  referral of the proposal to it, after a
 public hearing held on [due notice] TEN DAYS' NOTICE, submit its  report
 to  the  governing  body  certifying its unqualified consent, its disap-
 proval, or its qualified consent with recommendations for  modifications
 of the proposal.
  After  public  hearing held on [due notice] TEN DAYS' NOTICE after the
 report is received or due from the planning  commission,  the  governing
 body may:
  (i) if the commission shall have certified its unqualified consent, by
 majority vote authorize the agency to proceed with the acquisition;
