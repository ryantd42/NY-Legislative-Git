  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
recognize  and  acknowledge  those  organizations within our midst which
have made significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend  the
Brooklyn  Leaders Lions Club upon the occasion of hosting its Garden Tea
Party on Saturday,  May  27,  2023,  at  the  Paerdegat  Yacht  Club  in
Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Brooklyn  Leaders  Lions  Club is part of Lions Clubs
International, one of the largest service organizations  in  the  world,
and  is  deeply  committed  to meeting the challenges of public service;
currently, there are approximately 45,000 clubs in  204  countries  with
1.4 million members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The goal of the Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club and the entire
Lions organization is to empower volunteers to serve their  communities,
meet  humanitarian  needs,  encourage  peace  and  promote international
understanding; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lions are recognized worldwide for  their  service  to  the
blind  and  visually  impaired;  this  service  began  when Helen Keller
challenged the Lions to become her "knights of the blind in the  crusade
against darkness" during the Lions' 1925 International Convention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club was chartered on March 25,
2014, with 28 members, five of whom  came  from  the  Brooklyn  Outreach
Lions Club; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception, the Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club has
followed the tenets of the Lions Clubs  International  organization  and
has  strived  to create an environment where the spirit is uplifted, and
every individual is encouraged to take  part  in  the  civic,  cultural,
social  and  moral  development  of  their community; members are united
through the mutual understanding of the common  goal  of  serving  their
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  last  nine  years,  the Club has been serving its
community through back-to-school supplies giveaways,  feeding  the  less
fortunate,  Christmas  toys  and Mother's Day baskets giveaways, and eye
screenings with the intent of helping if eyeglasses are needed; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club  also  makes  donations  to
some  countries in the Caribbean/West Indies, and to the Cancer Society,
the TEAL Society,  the  Blind  Society,  St.  Jude  Children's  Research
Hospital, and many other charitable organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
 
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club upon the occasion of hosting its
Garden Tea Party on May 27, 2023, and to honor  its  members,  past  and
present,  who  have labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the
quality of life in the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Brooklyn Leaders Lions Club.
