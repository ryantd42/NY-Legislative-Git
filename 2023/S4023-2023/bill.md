 Introduced  by  Sen.  GRIFFO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law and the  executive  law,  in
  relation  to the field testing of mobile telephones and portable elec-
  tronic devices after a motor vehicle accident or  collision  involving
  damage to real or personal property, personal injury or death
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds  that  the
 use  of  mobile  telephones and/or personal electronic devices has dras-
 tically increased the prevalence of distracted driving. This destructive
 behavior endangers the lives of every driver and passenger traveling  on
 New  York  state roadways. In 2001, this legislature enacted legislation
 prohibiting the use of mobile telephones  while  driving,  and  in  2009
 updated  the  law to include all portable electronic devices. The execu-
 tive branch initiated a public campaign against  cell  phone  use  while
 driving, and has even established "text stops" along all major highways.
 While these efforts have brought much needed attention to the dangers of
 distracted driving, reports indicate that 67 percent of drivers admit to
 continued  use  of  their cell phones while driving despite knowledge of
 the inherent danger to themselves and others on  the  road.  A  10  year
 trend  of  declining collisions and casualties was reversed this year as
 crashes are up 14 percent, and fatalities increased 8 percent,  suggest-
 ing  that  the  problem  has not only gotten worse, but is still greatly
 misunderstood.
  Furthermore, law enforcement has  a  difficult  time  enforcing  these
 public  safety laws, especially after an accident where it is impossible
 to discern whether the operator of a motor vehicle was in fact using his
 or her cell phone immediately prior to or at the time of the collision.
  Empowering our law enforcement with technology, which is able to imme-
 diately determine cell phone usage without an inquiry into the  content,

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 will  allow  enforcement  of  these  laws  after an accident while still
 protecting essential privacy rights. Therefore,  the  legislature  finds
 that  while  technology  has  created this grave danger, it also has the
 capacity  to  aid law enforcement in tackling and eradicating distracted
 driving caused by mobile telephones and personal electronic devices.
  The legislature further finds that a driver's license is  a  privilege
 granted  by the state, and maintaining such privilege requires continued
 compliance with established  conditions  enumerated  in  law.  One  such
 condition is implied consent, an accepted mechanism in combating driving
 while  under the influence of alcohol. Studies have concluded that text-
 ing while driving impairs a driver to the level  of  .08  blood  alcohol
 level. Therefore, it is in the state's interest to treat this impairment
 with  a  similar  methodology  to  that  of  drunk  driving. The state's
 invested interest in promoting public safety  and  preventing  senseless
 loss of life justifies the creation of Evan's law.
  §  2. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as "Evan's
 law".
  § 3. Section 215 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended  by  adding
 two new subdivisions (d) and (e) to read as follows:
  (D)  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL, JOINTLY WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SERVICES, PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND TAKE  ANY  OTHER
 ACTION  NECESSARY  TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED
 TWENTY-FIVE-E OF THIS CHAPTER, RELATING TO FIELD TESTING OF MOBILE TELE-
 PHONES AND PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES. SUCH ACTIONS SHALL  INCLUDE  THE
 TESTING  AND DETERMINATION OF THE RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY OF ELECTRONIC
 SCANNING DEVICES USED FOR  SUCH  FIELD  TESTING.  THE  COMMISSIONER  AND
 COMMISSIONER OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES SHALL APPROVE ELECTRONIC SCAN-
 NING DEVICES WHICH ARE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCT-
 ING  FIELD TESTING. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE COMMIS-
 SIONER SHALL NOT REQUIRE ANY POLICE DEPARTMENT  TO  PURCHASE  ELECTRONIC
 SCANNING  DEVICES  FOR  FIELD TESTING. PARTICIPATION IN FIELD TESTING OF
 MOBILE TELEPHONES AND PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES USING ELECTRONIC SCAN-
 NING DEVICES SHALL BE OPTIONAL FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS.
  (E) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONDUCT A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN  RELAT-
 ING  TO  THE  FIELD TESTING OF MOBILE TELEPHONES AND PORTABLE ELECTRONIC
 DEVICES, AND THE IMPLIED CONSENT TO SUCH TESTING OF ANY PERSON OPERATING
 A MOTOR VEHICLE IN THIS STATE. SUCH CAMPAIGN SHALL  INCLUDE  INFORMATION
 PAMPHLETS PROVIDED WITH EACH APPLICATION FOR A LEARNER'S PERMIT OR DRIV-
 ER'S LICENSE, AND EACH RENEWAL THEREOF.
  §  4. Paragraph (h) of subdivision 2 of section 503 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by section 1 of part PP of  chapter  59  of  the
 laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  (h)  An  applicant whose driver's license has been revoked pursuant to
 (i) section five hundred ten of this title, (ii) section eleven  hundred
 ninety-three  of  this chapter, [and] (iii) section eleven hundred nine-
 ty-four of this chapter, AND (IV) SECTION TWELVE  HUNDRED  TWENTY-FIVE-E
 OF  THIS  CHAPTER,  shall,  upon  application for issuance of a driver's
 license, pay to the commissioner a fee of one hundred dollars. When  the
 basis  for  the revocation is a finding of driving after having consumed
 alcohol  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  eleven  hundred
 ninety-two-a  of  this  chapter,  the fee to be paid to the commissioner
 shall be one hundred dollars. Such fee is not refundable and  shall  not
 be  returned  to the applicant regardless of the action the commissioner
 may take on such person's application for reinstatement of such  driving
 license.  Such  fee  shall  be  in  addition to any other fees presently
 levied but shall not apply to an applicant whose  driver's  license  was
 S. 4023  3
 
 revoked  for  failure to pass a reexamination or to an applicant who has
 been issued a conditional or restricted use license under the provisions
 of article twenty-one-A or thirty-one of this chapter.
  §  5.  Subparagraph  (iv) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section
 511 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by  chapter  607  of  the
 laws  of  1993,  is  amended and a new paragraph (v) is added to read as
 follows:
  (iv) such person has in effect three or more suspensions,  imposed  on
 at  least  three  separate dates, for failure to answer, appear or pay a
 fine, pursuant to subdivision three of section two hundred twenty-six or
 subdivision four-a of section five hundred ten of this chapter[.]; OR
  (V) THE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION IS BASED UPON REFUSAL TO SURRENDER  A
 MOBILE  TELEPHONE OR PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR FIELD TESTING PURSU-
 ANT TO SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE-E OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 6. The vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 1225-e to read as follows:

 THE COMMISSIONER, IN ANY CASE WHERE THE PERSON HAS HAD A  PRIOR  REVOCA-
 TION  RESULTING FROM REFUSAL TO SURRENDER HIS OR HER MOBILE TELEPHONE OR
 PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR FIELD TESTING  WITHIN  FIVE  YEARS  IMME-
 DIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF SUCH REVOCATION.
  (2)  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, ANY PERSON WHOSE LICENSE, PERMIT TO
 DRIVE OR ANY NON-RESIDENT OPERATING PRIVILEGE IS REVOKED PURSUANT TO THE
