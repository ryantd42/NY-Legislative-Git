 Introduced  by  M. of A. WEPRIN -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. COLTON
  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Insurance
 
 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to  improving  disclosure
  to automobile insurance consumers; and to amend the executive law, the
  insurance  law and the state administrative procedure act, in relation
  to establishing an independent office  of  public  insurance  consumer
  advocate and establishing its powers and duties
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  The insurance law is amended by adding a new article 6  to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 6
  AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CONSUMER INFORMATION
 SECTION 601. TITLE; LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION AND PURPOSE.
  602.  AUTOMOBILE  INSURANCE  CONSUMER  INFORMATION AND COMPLAINT
  RANKINGS.
  603. CONSUMER RATING FACTORS.
  604. DISCLOSURE PROCEDURES.
  605. NONINTERFERENCE WITH OBTAINING COVERAGE.
  606. PUBLIC OUTREACH.
  § 601. TITLE; LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION AND PURPOSE. THIS ARTICLE  SHALL
 BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE "AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CONSUMER INFORMA-
 TION ACT".
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FINDS  AND  DECLARES  THAT  AUTOMOBILE  INSURANCE IS
 REQUIRED BY LAW FOR ALL RESIDENTS WHO DRIVE AND THAT THE COST OF AUTOMO-
 BILE INSURANCE REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE FOR MANY CONSUMERS.  THE
 LEGISLATURE  FURTHER FINDS THAT THE PREMIUM COSTS FOR ANY GIVEN INDIVID-
 UAL FOR IDENTICAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FROM  DIFFERENT  LICENSED  INSURERS
 CAN  VARY  WIDELY  AND THAT WIDE VARIATIONS ALSO EXIST IN THE QUALITY OF
 SERVICE PROVIDED BY INSURERS AS  MEASURED  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT'S  ANNUAL
 COMPLAINT HANDLING RANKINGS. IN ADDITION, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT FEW
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 CONSUMERS  ARE  AWARE  OF  THESE  WIDE COST AND QUALITY OF SERVICE VARI-
 ATIONS, THAT AS A RESULT CONSUMERS  AS  A  GROUP  MAY  PAY  HUNDREDS  OF
 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR OVERPRICED POLICIES AND THAT INDIVIDUAL
 CONSUMERS  MAY  ENCOUNTER UNNECESSARY DIFFICULTY IN HAVING THEIR AUTOMO-
 BILE INSURANCE CLAIMS AND COMPLAINTS HANDLED EXPEDITIOUSLY.  THE  LEGIS-
 LATURE FURTHER FINDS AND DECLARES THAT IT INTENDS FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT
 AND THE DEPARTMENT TO  HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER THIS ARTICLE TO ESTAB-
 LISH  MECHANISMS  TO  FULLY  INFORM  CONSUMERS  AS TO WHICH POLICIES ARE
 AVAILABLE TO THEM AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST AND WHICH INSURERS PROVIDE
 THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF SERVICE. THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS WITH THIS  ARTI-
 CLE TO CREATE CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL MAKE SUCH INFOR-
 MATION  MORE  READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL CONSUMERS. INCREASED AVAILABILITY
 OF INFORMATION IS INTENDED TO MAKE THE AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE SYSTEM  MORE
 COMPETITIVE  WITH  RESPECT  TO  BOTH COST OF COVERAGE AND THE QUALITY OF
 SERVICE.
  § 602. AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CONSUMER INFORMATION AND  COMPLAINT  RANK-
 INGS.  (A)  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL  MAINTAIN  A  DATABASE CONTAINING
 NONBUSINESS AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE RATE INFORMATION AND COMPLAINT RANKINGS
 FOR ALL COMPANIES LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE.
  (B) EVERY PERSON, UPON MAKING AN INQUIRY TO THE DEPARTMENT AND PROVID-

 ER; AND THE MOST RECENT COMPLAINT RANKING OF EACH SUCH INSURER;
  (2)  THE  NAMES, ADDRESSES, TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND, IF APPROPRIATE, WEB

  (3) AN EXPLANATION OF HOW TO OBTAIN FROM  SUCH  COMPANIES  THE  NAMES,
 ADDRESSES, TELEPHONE NUMBERS, AND, IF APPROPRIATE, WEB SITE ADDRESSES OF
 THOSE  AGENTS,  BROKERS  OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH COMPANIES THAT

 PERSONS  MAKING AN INQUIRY THE DEPARTMENT'S ANNUAL RANKING OF AUTOMOBILE
 INSURANCE COMPLAINTS AND CONSUMERS GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE.  AFTER  THE
 DATABASE  IS  ESTABLISHED,  IF THE PERSON MAKING AN INQUIRY PREFERS, THE
 DEPARTMENT MAY PROVIDE, IN LIEU OF THE INFORMATION  SPECIFIED  IN  PARA-
