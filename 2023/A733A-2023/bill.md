 AN ACT to amend the public health law and the insurance law, in relation
  to providing information to patients and the  public  on  policy-based
  exclusions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that since 2003
 more than 40 community hospitals in New York state have closed.
  The legislature additionally  finds  that  as  a  result  of  hospital
 consolidation,  large  health  care  systems  now  control  more than 70
 percent of acute hospital beds in the state and that these systems some-
 times remove categories of care from local hospitals,  leaving  patients
 in  regions  of  the  state  without access to particular types of care,
 including some types of emergency care.
  The legislature further finds that patients do not have the ability to
 determine whether the hospital, or hospitals, in their area provides the
 care they seek, because information about  how  hospitals'  restrictions
 impact options for care is too difficult to obtain.
  The  legislature  also  finds that denials of care can lead to serious
 adverse health impacts that jeopardize individuals' lives and  wellbeing
 and  that New York needs to understand health care gaps and their impact
 statewide.
  Finally, the legislature finds that some denials of care violate state
 and federal law.
  § 2. Section 2803 of the public health law is amended by adding a  new
 subdivision 14 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
