 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  declaring a climate emergency and placing a ban  on  new  fossil  fuel
  infrastructure

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The environmental conservation law is amended by  adding  a
 new section 1-0103 to read as follows:
 § 1-0103. CLIMATE EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND POLICY.
  1. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THE FOLLOWING:
  (A)  A  CLIMATE EMERGENCY EXISTS THAT THREATENS THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
 THE NATION, AND THE WORLD;
  (B) IRREVOCABLE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN  CAUSED  BY  GLOBAL
 WARMING OF APPROXIMATELY ONE DEGREE CELSIUS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE EARTH
 IS  ALREADY TOO HOT FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE, AS ATTESTED BY INCREASED AND
 INTENSIFYING WILDFIRES, FLOODS, RISING  SEAS,  DISEASES,  DROUGHTS,  AND
 EXTREME WEATHER;
  (C)  ON  APRIL TWENTY-SECOND, TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN, WORLD LEADERS FROM
 ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR COUNTRIES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION RECOGNIZED THE
 THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE URGENT NEED TO COMBAT IT BY SIGNING THE
 PARIS AGREEMENT, AGREEING TO KEEP WARMING WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS
 ABOVE PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS AND TO PURSUE EFFORTS TO LIMIT  THE  TEMPER-
 ATURE INCREASE TO ONE AND ONE-HALF DEGREES FAHRENHEIT;
  (D)  ON  OCTOBER  EIGHTH,  TWO  THOUSAND  EIGHTEEN, THE UNITED NATIONS
 INTERNATIONAL PANEL  ON  CLIMATE  CHANGE  ("IPCC")  RELEASED  A  SPECIAL
 REPORT,  WHICH  PROJECTED  THAT LIMITING WARMING TO THE ONE AND ONE-HALF
 DEGREES CELSIUS TARGET THIS CENTURY WILL REQUIRE AN UNPRECEDENTED TRANS-
 FORMATION OF EVERY SECTOR OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY  OVER  THE  NEXT  TWELVE
 YEARS;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 3581  2
 
  (E) ON NOVEMBER TWENTY-THIRD, TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN, THE UNITED STATES
 FOURTH NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT ("NCA4") WAS RELEASED AND DETAILS THE
 MASSIVE  THREAT  THAT  CLIMATE CHANGE POSES TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, OUR
 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE STABILITY, AND UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR  IMMEDI-
 ATE CLIMATE EMERGENCY ACTION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT;
  (F)  ACCORDING  TO THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION'S
 (NASA) GODDARD INSTITUTE FOR SPACE STUDIES (GISS),  GLOBAL  TEMPERATURES
 IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE EIGHTY-THREE ONE-HUNDREDTHS DEGREES CELSI-
 US  (ONE  AND  ONE-HALF  DEGREES  FAHRENHEIT)  WARMER  THAN THE NINETEEN
 HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE TO NINETEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MEAN,  AND  THE  PAST  FIVE
 YEARS ARE COLLECTIVELY THE WARMEST IN MODERN HISTORY;
  (G)  WORLD  WILDLIFE FUND'S 2018 LIVING PLANET REPORT FINDS THAT THERE
 HAS BEEN A SIXTY PER  CENTUM  DECLINE  IN  GLOBAL  WILDLIFE  POPULATIONS
 BETWEEN  NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN, WITH CAUSES
 INCLUDING OVERFISHING, POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE;
  (H) ACCORDING TO  THE  INTERGOVERNMENTAL  SCIENCE-POLICY  PLATFORM  ON
 BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, HUMAN ACTIVITY HAS ALREADY SEVERELY
 ALTERED  FORTY PER CENTUM OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, FIFTY PER CENTUM OF
 INLAND WATERWAYS, AND SEVENTY-FIVE PER CENTUM OF THE PLANET'S LAND,  AND
 IT  IS  PROJECTED  THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ONE MILLION SPECIES ARE
 THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION, MANY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES;
  (I) GLOBALLY, EIGHTEEN OF THE NINETEEN HOTTEST YEARS  ON  RECORD  HAVE
 OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE;
  (J) THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF
 CLIMATE  CHANGE  AND HAS ALREADY BEEN SUBJECTED TO DEVASTATING DISASTERS
 CAUSED BY GLOBAL WARMING, INCLUDING INCREASING  SUPERSTORMS  AND  SEVERE
 FLOODING;
  (K)  MARGINALIZED  POPULATIONS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND WORLDWIDE,
 INCLUDING PEOPLE OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, INDIGENOUS  COMMUNITIES,  LOW-IN-
 COME INDIVIDUALS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND THE UNHOUSED ARE ALREADY
 DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR
 AN  EXCESS  BURDEN  AS TEMPERATURES INCREASE, OCEANS RISE, AND DISASTERS
 WORSEN;
  (L) RESTORING A SAFE AND STABLE  CLIMATE  AND  REVERSING  BIODIVERSITY
 LOSS  REQUIRES AN EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION ON A SCALE NOT SEEN SINCE WORLD
 WAR II TO ATTAIN ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS  ACROSS  ALL  SECTORS  AT
 WARTIME  SPEED,  TO  RAPIDLY  AND  SAFELY DRAW DOWN OR REMOVE ALL EXCESS
 CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, AND TO IMPLEMENT  MEASURES  TO  PROTECT  ALL
 PEOPLE  AND  SPECIES  FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE AND
 ECOLOGICAL DESTRUCTION;
  (M) BUILDING A SOCIETY THAT IS RESILIENT TO THE CURRENT, EXPECTED, AND
 POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL PROTECT HEALTH, LIVES, ENVIRON-
 MENTS, AND ECONOMIES.  RESILIENCE IS BEST ACHIEVED BY PREPARING FOR  THE
 MOST DRAMATIC POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE; AND
  (N) JUSTICE DEMANDS CLIMATE POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC EXPERI-
 ENCES,  VULNERABILITIES,  AND NEEDS OF THE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES MOST
 AFFECTED BY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND INCLUDES  THOSE  COMMUNI-
 TIES IN CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE PLANNING, POLICY AND ACTIONS.
  2.  IT IS HEREBY DECLARED TO BE THE POLICY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO
 RESTORE AN OPTIMAL SAFE CLIMATE AND TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM  PROTECTION  FROM
 CLIMATE  CHANGE  TO ALL PEOPLE AND SPECIES, GLOBALLY, INCLUDING THE MOST
 VULNERABLE.
  3. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE STATE DO  ALL  OF  THE
 FOLLOWING IN FURTHERANCE OF SUCH POLICY:
  (A) CONVERT THE ECONOMY TO NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS QUICK-
 LY AS POSSIBLE.
 S. 3581  3
 
  (B)  IMMEDIATELY  INITIATE  A  MULTIGENERATIONAL  EFFORT  TO DRAW DOWN
 GREENHOUSE GASES ALREADY IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN AS SHORT A TIME AS  POSSI-
 BLE, AND DEVELOP RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS GOAL.
  (C) IMMEDIATELY INITIATE A MASSIVE EFFORT TO RESTORE ECOSYSTEMS.
  (D) RESPOND TO THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY BASED ON A JUST TRANSITION FRAME-
 WORK  THAT  FOCUSES  ON  EQUITY, SELF-DETERMINATION, CULTURE, TRADITION,
 DEMOCRACY, AND THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO CLEAN, HEAL-
 THY, AND ADEQUATE AIR, WATER, LAND, FOOD, EDUCATION, AND SHELTER.
  (E) ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN  CLIMATE-EMERGENCY-RELATED  DELIBERATIONS  SO
 THAT  CITIZENS  CAN SEE THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE POLICY AND RESOURCE DECI-
 SIONS THAT IMPACT THEIR DAILY LIVES AND THEIR FUTURE.
  (F) ENCOURAGE NONGOVERNMENT ACTORS TO CONTRIBUTE  TO  THE  DEVELOPMENT
 AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLUTIONS.
  (G)  A  SWEEPING  OVERHAUL  OF  THE ECONOMY THAT CENTERS ON EQUITY AND
 JUSTICE IN ITS SOLUTIONS IS VITAL TO OUR FUTURE  AND  MUST  INCLUDE  THE
 FOLLOWING  GOALS:  DRAMATICALLY  EXPAND EXISTING RENEWABLE POWER SOURCES
 AND DEPLOY NEW PRODUCTION CAPACITY WITH THE GOAL OF MEETING ONE  HUNDRED
 PER  CENTUM  OF NATIONAL POWER DEMAND THROUGH RENEWABLE SOURCES; BUILD A
 NATIONAL, ENERGY-EFFICIENT, "SMART" GRID; UPGRADE EVERY RESIDENTIAL  AND
 INDUSTRIAL  BUILDING FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART ENERGY EFFICIENCY, COMFORT AND
 SAFETY; ELIMINATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM MANUFACTURING,  AGRICUL-
 TURAL  AND OTHER INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BY INVESTING IN LOCAL-SCALE AGRI-
 CULTURE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY; REPAIR AND IMPROVE  TRANSPOR-
 TATION  AND  OTHER  INFRASTRUCTURE,  AND UPGRADE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TO
 ENSURE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER; FUND MASSIVE INVESTMENT  IN  THE
 DRAWDOWN  OF  GREENHOUSE  GASES;  AND MAKE "GREEN" TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRY,
 EXPERTISE, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A MAJOR EXPORT OF  THE  UNITED  STATES,
 WITH THE AIM OF BECOMING THE INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN HELPING OTHER COUN-
 TRIES  BECOME  GREENHOUSE  GAS  NEUTRAL  ECONOMIES  AND BRINGING ABOUT A
 GLOBAL TRANSITION.
  (H) SUPPORT EFFORTS FOR AN EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION TO  RESTORE  A  SAFE
 CLIMATE IN OTHER STATES AND AT THE FEDERAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL.
