 AN ACT establishing the New York task force on automated  vehicle  tech-
  nology; and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon the expi-
  ration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that  automated
 vehicle technology offers widely anticipated and revolutionary potential
 for  the  transportation  sector.  Among the unprecedented opportunities
 offered by this technology are inclusive  mobility  options  to  benefit
 disadvantaged,  disabled  and elderly residents; as congestion and emis-
 sions mitigation; improved livable land use, and  basic  road.  Further,
 the  legislature  has  amended section 2 of part FF of chapter 55 of the
 laws of 2017, relating to motor vehicles equipped with autonomous  vehi-
 cle  technology,  as amended by section 2 of part H of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2018, as amended by section 1 of part M of  chapter  58  of  the
 laws  of  2019,  to  allow for a two-year testing program for automobile
 manufacturers and technology leaders to test and  demonstrate  automated
 vehicle technology in New York, which will expire and be deemed repealed
 April  1,  2023.  Consequently,  the legislature finds that there is a
 pressing need for policymakers to study automated vehicle technology and
 formulate comprehensive laws and regulations  to  ensure  the  state  is
 prepared for the safe deployment of automobiles equipped with this tech-
 nology  and to help prepare the state's role in a future where automated
 vehicle technology plays in shaping  our  roadways,  economy,  education
 system, and society.
  To  this  end,  it is in the public interest to establish an automated
 vehicle task force that shall study, evaluate  and  develop  recommenda-
 tions  relating  to  specific actionable measures that address how auto-
