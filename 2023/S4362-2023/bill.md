 AN ACT to amend the insurance law and the public health law, in relation
  to  shortening  time  frames  during which an insurer has to determine
  whether a pre-authorization request is medically necessary

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subsection (b) of section 4903 of the insur-
 ance  law,  as separately amended by section 16 of part YY and section 7
 of part KKK of chapter 56 of the laws of 2020, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (1)  A utilization review agent shall make a utilization review deter-
 mination involving health care services which require  pre-authorization
 and provide notice of a determination to the insured or insured's desig-
 nee  and  the insured's health care provider by telephone and in writing
 within three [business] days of receipt of the necessary information, or
 for inpatient rehabilitation services following  an  inpatient  hospital
 admission provided by a hospital or skilled nursing facility, within one
 business  day of receipt of the necessary information.  The notification
 shall identify: (i) whether the services are  considered  in-network  or
 out-of-network;  (ii)  whether the insured will be held harmless for the
 services and not be responsible for any payment, other than any applica-
 ble co-payment, co-insurance or deductible;  (iii)  as  applicable,  the
 dollar  amount  the  health care plan will pay if the service is out-of-
 network; and (iv) as applicable, information explaining how  an  insured
 may  determine  the  anticipated  out-of-pocket  cost for out-of-network
 health care services in a geographical area or zip code based  upon  the
 difference  between what the health care plan will reimburse for out-of-
 network health care services and the usual and customary cost  for  out-
 of-network health care services.
