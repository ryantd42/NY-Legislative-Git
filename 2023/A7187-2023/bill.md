  §  4.  Subdivisions 2, 3 and 5 of section 367-c of the social services
 law, subdivisions 2 and 3 as amended by chapter 636 of the laws of 1980,
 subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 165 of the laws of 1991, are amended
 to read as follows:
  2. If a person eligible to receive services under  the  provisions  of
 this  title  who requires care, treatment, maintenance, nursing or other
 services in a nursing home desires to remain and is deemed by [his]  THE
 PERSON'S  physician,  NURSE PRACTITIONER, OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT, ACTING
 WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL'S LAWFUL SCOPE OF PRACTICE UNDER TITLE EIGHT  OF
 THE  EDUCATION LAW, able to remain in [his] THE PERSON'S own home or the
 home of a responsible relative or other responsible adult if the  neces-
 sary  services are provided, such person or [his] THE PERSON'S represen-
 tative shall so inform the local social services  official.  If  a  long
 term home health care program as defined under article thirty-six of the
 public  health law is provided in the social services district for which
 [he] THE OFFICIAL  has  authority,  such  official  shall  authorize  an
 assessment under the provisions of section thirty-six hundred sixteen of
 the  public  health  law. If the results of the assessment indicate that
 the person can receive the appropriate level of care at home, the  offi-
 cial  shall prepare for that person a plan for the provision of services
 comparable to those that would be rendered in a nursing home. In  devel-
 oping  such plan, the official shall consult with those persons perform-
 ing the assessment. The services shall be provided by a  certified  home
 health  agency, hospital, or residential health care facility authorized
 by the commissioner of health under article  thirty-six  of  the  public
 health  law to provide a long term home health care program. At the time
 of the initial assessment, and at the time of each subsequent assessment
 performed under the provisions of section thirty-six hundred sixteen  of
 the  public health law, or more often if the person's needs require, the
 official shall establish a monthly budget in accordance with which  [he]
 THE  OFFICIAL  shall  authorize  payment for the services provided under
 such plan. Total monthly expenditures made under  this  title  for  such
 person  shall  not  exceed  a  maximum of seventy-five per cent, or such
 lesser percentage as may be determined by the commissioner, of the aver-
 age of the monthly rates payable  under  this  title  for  nursing  home
 services  within the social services district for which the official has
 authority. However, if a continuing assessment  of  the  person's  needs
 A. 7187  4
 
 demonstrates  that  [he]  THE  PERSON  requires  increased services, the
 social services official may authorize the  expenditure  of  any  amount
 accrued  under this section during the past twelve months as a result of
 the  expenditures  for  that  person  not  exceeding such maximum. If an
 assessment of the person's  needs  demonstrates  that  [he]  THE  PERSON
 requires  services the payment for which would exceed such monthly maxi-
 mum, but it can be reasonably anticipated that  total  expenditures  for
 required  services  for  such person will not exceed such maximum calcu-
 lated over a one year period, the social services official may authorize
 payment for such services.
  3. If a person eligible to receive services under  the  provisions  of
 this  title who requires health related care and services in an interme-
 diate care facility desires  to  remain  and  is  deemed  by  [his]  THE
 PERSON'S  physician,  NURSE PRACTITIONER, OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT, ACTING
 WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL'S LAWFUL SCOPE OF PRACTICE UNDER TITLE EIGHT  OF
 THE  EDUCATION LAW, able to remain in [his] THE PERSON'S own home or the
 home of a responsible relative or other responsible adult if the  neces-
 sary  services are provided, such person or [his] THE PERSON'S represen-
 tative shall so inform the local social services official.  If  a  long
 term home health care program as defined under article thirty-six of the
 public  health law is provided in the social services district for which
 [he] THE OFFICIAL  has  authority,  such  official  shall  authorize  an
 assessment under the provisions of section thirty-six hundred sixteen of
 the  public  health  law. If the results of the assessment indicate that
 the person can receive the appropriate level of care at home, the  offi-
 cial  shall prepare for that person a plan for the provision of services
 comparable to those that would  be  rendered  in  an  intermediate  care
 facility. In developing such plan, the official shall consult with those
 persons  performing  the assessment. The services shall be provided by a
 certified home health  agency,  hospital,  or  residential  health  care
 facility  authorized by the commissioner of health under article thirty-
 six of the public health law to provide a long  term  home  health  care
 program.  At  the time of the initial assessment and at the time of each
 subsequent assessment performed under the provisions of section  thirty-
 six  hundred  sixteen  of  the  public  health law, or more often if the
 person's needs require, the official shall establish a monthly budget in
 accordance with which [he] THE OFFICIAL shall authorize payment for  the
 services provided under that plan. Total monthly expenditures made under
 this  title  for  such person shall not exceed a maximum of seventy-five
 per cent, or such lesser percentage as may be determined by the  commis-
 sioner,  of  the  average of the monthly rates paid under this title for
 the provision of health related care and services in  intermediate  care
 facilities  within  the  social services district for which the official
 has authority. However, if a continuing assessment of the person's needs
 demonstrates that [he]  THE  PERSON  requires  increased  services,  the
 social  services  official  may  authorize the expenditure of any amount
 accrued under this section during the past twelve months as a result  of
 the  expenditures  for  that  person  not  exceeding such maximum. If an
 assessment of the person's  needs  demonstrates  that  [he]  THE  PERSON
 requires  services the payment for which would exceed such monthly maxi-
 mum, but it can be reasonably anticipated that  total  expenditures  for
 required  services  for  such person will not exceed such maximum calcu-
 lated over a one year period, the social services official may authorize
 payment for such services.
  5. If a person eligible to receive services under  the  provisions  of
 this  title  who is medically eligible for care, treatment, maintenance,
 A. 7187  5
 
 nursing or other services in a nursing home or is medically eligible for
 health related care  and  services  in  an  intermediate  care  facility
 desires  to  and is deemed by [his or her] THE PERSON'S physician, NURSE
 PRACTITIONER,  OR  PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT, ACTING WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL'S
 LAWFUL SCOPE OF PRACTICE UNDER TITLE EIGHT OF THE EDUCATION LAW, able to
 remain in an adult care facility, other than a shelter for adults, which
 is able and willing to retain such person if the necessary services  are
 provided, such person or [his or her] THE PERSON'S representatives shall
 so inform the local social services official. If a long term home health
 care  program  is provided in a social services district, an official of
 such district shall authorize an  assessment  under  the  provisions  of
 section  three thousand six hundred sixteen of the public health law. If
 the results of the assessment indicate that the person can  receive  the
 appropriate  level  of  care at such location, and meets the appropriate
 standards for continued stay for such facility as are established by law
 and regulation, such official shall prepare for that person a  plan  for
 the  provision  of services. In developing such plan, the official shall
 consult with those persons performing the assessment and with the opera-
 tor of the adult care facility. The services shall be provided by a long
 term home health care program authorized pursuant to article  thirty-six
 of  the  public  health  law, provided, however that notwithstanding the
 provisions of section three thousand six hundred sixteen  of  such  law,
 services  shall  not  be provided prior to the completion of the assess-
 ment. At the time of the initial assessment and  at  the  time  of  each
 subsequent  assessment  performed  under the provisions of section three
 thousand six hundred sixteen of the public health law, or more often  if
 the person's needs require, the official shall establish a monthly budg-
 et  in  accordance  with which [he] THE OFFICIAL shall authorize payment
 for the services provided under that plan,  provided,  however  that  no
 services  shall  be  authorized  in  the  plan which the operator of the
 facility is required by law and regulation to  provide.  The  long  term
 home  health  care  program  providing  services authorized in such plan
 shall be solely responsible for managing and providing or arranging  for
 such  authorized services. The operator of the adult care facility shall
 be solely responsible for managing and providing  those  services  which
 the  facility  is required by law or regulation to provide. However, the
 two entities shall collaborate to  assure  coordination.  Total  monthly
 expenditures  made  under  this title for such person shall not exceed a
 maximum of fifty percent, or such lesser percentage as may be determined
 by the commissioner, of the average of the monthly rates paid under this
 title for the provision of nursing home services or health related  care
 and  services in intermediate care facilities, whichever is appropriate,
 within the social services district for which the official has  authori-
 ty.  However,  if  a  continuing assessment of the person's needs demon-
 strates that he or she requires increased services, the social  services
 official  may authorize the expenditure of any amount accrued under this
 section during the past twelve months as a result  of  the  expenditures
 for  that  person  not  exceeding  such maximum. If an assessment of the
 person's needs  demonstrates  that  [he  or  she]  THE  PERSON  requires
 services the payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it
 can  be  reasonably  anticipated  that  total  expenditures for required
 services for such person will not exceed such maximum calculated over  a
 one  year period, the social services official may authorize payment for
 such services. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be deemed to
 alter standards for admission to an adult care facility  nor  shall  the
 A. 7187  6
 
 admission  of a person into such facility be contingent on such person's
 enrollment in a long term home health care program.
  §  5.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
