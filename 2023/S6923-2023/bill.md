 PRIOR TO TRAVELING ON TRACKS WITHIN THE STATE.  SUCH  SAFETY  INSPECTION
 SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, A REVIEW OF TRACKS, WHEELS, SAFETY
 EQUIPMENT,  INCLUDING  BRAKES AND BEARINGS, AND TRAIN CARS.  THE DEPART-
 MENT OF TRANSPORTATION SHALL COMPARE SUCH SAFETY INSPECTION RESULTS WITH
 THE INSPECTION THE RAILROAD CORPORATION CONDUCTED PRIOR  TO  ORIGINATING
 THE ENTIRE PLANNED TRIP.
  2.  EVERY RAILROAD CORPORATION WHICH OPERATES ANY FREIGHT TRAIN WITHIN
 THE STATE SHALL HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWO SAFETY INSPECTORS ON  EITHER  SIDE

 ISSUES.
  3. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROMULGATE ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS  NECES-
 SARY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SECTION.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law; provided, further, that  this  act  shall  be  deemed
 repealed if any federal agency determines in writing that this act would
 render New York state ineligible for the receipt of federal funds or any
 court  of  competent jurisdiction finally determines that this act would
