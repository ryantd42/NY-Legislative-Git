 AN ACT authorizing the state university of New York to lease  a  portion
  of  the  lands  on the campus of SUNY Buffalo State University for the
  relocation and operation of the Leonardo da Vinci High School; and  to
  amend  the  education  law, in relation to the computation of building
  aid for the renovation and equipping of the  Leonardo  da  Vinci  high

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New York at Buffalo State ("SUNY Buffalo State Universi-
 ty") seeks to lease Buckham Hall building number 32 and surrounding land
 on the north and west sides on SUNY Buffalo State University's campus to
 the Buckham Development Corporation for  the  purpose  of  enabling  the
 Buckham  Development  Corporation  to lease such grounds and facility to
 the city school district of the city of Buffalo for the purpose of relo-
 cating such district's Leonardo da Vinci High School program.
  The legislature further finds that such an arrangement will afford the
 city school district of the city of  Buffalo  the  ability  to  renovate
 Buckham  Hall for use by Leonardo da Vinci High School thereby providing
 approximately 400 grade 9-12  city  school  district  pupils  access  to
 college  level  courses  and  a campus-based experience, and potentially
 increasing future SUNY Buffalo State University enrollment, while creat-
 ing opportunities for partnership and enrichment between the city school
 district of the city of Buffalo and SUNY Buffalo State University.
  Finally, the legislature finds that granting the trustees of the state
 university of New York the authority and power to  lease  and  otherwise
 contract  to  make  available the aforementioned grounds and facility on
 the campus of the SUNY Buffalo State University for these purposes  will

 promote  the  provision  of educational opportunities for the University
 and the surrounding community.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the state univer-
 sity of New York trustees are  authorized  and  empowered,  without  any
 public  bidding,  to  lease  and otherwise contract to make available to
 Buckham  Development  Corporation,  a  not-for-profit  corporation  (the
 "ground  lessee"),  a  portion  of the lands of the university generally
 described in section four of this act for the purpose of authorizing the
 city school district of the city of Buffalo  to  relocate  and  develop,
 construct,  maintain  and  operate Leonardo da Vinci High School for the
 city school district's students. Such lease  or  contract  between  SUNY
 Buffalo  State  University and the Buckham Development Corporation shall
 be for a period not exceeding 37 years without any fee simple conveyance
 and otherwise upon terms and conditions  determined  by  such  trustees,
 subject  to  the approval of the director of the division of the budget,
 the attorney general and the state comptroller. In the  event  that  the
 real  property that is the subject of such lease or contract shall cease
 to be used for the purpose described in this act, such lease or contract
 shall immediately terminate and the real property and  any  improvements
 thereon  shall  revert to the state university of New York. Any lease or
 contract entered into pursuant to this act shall provide that  the  real
 property  that is the subject of such lease or contract and any improve-
 ments thereon shall revert to the state university of New  York  on  the
 expiration  of  such  contract or lease. Such contract or lease shall be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law and shall include an indemnity provision whereby the lessee  or
 sublessee  promises  to  indemnify,  hold harmless and defend the lessor
 against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all persons on  the
 leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents, contractors, subcon-
 tractors,  employees, customers, guests, licensees, invitees and members
 of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether real or
 personal, or for personal injuries arising out of tenant's use or  occu-
 pation of the demised premises.
  §  3.  It  is  expressly found that the relocation to the SUNY Buffalo
 State University campus and operation of  the  Leonardo  da  Vinci  High
 School  may  be  authorized by the board of education of the city school
 district of the city of Buffalo pursuant to the laws,  rules  and  regu-
 lations  which  are  applicable to a public high school unless otherwise
 provided for in this act. The high school shall be subject to the  over-
 sight  of  the  board  of  regents and the program shall be audited in a
 manner consistent with provisions of law and regulations that are appli-
 cable to other public schools. The board of education of the city school
 district of the city of Buffalo shall have the  responsibility  for  the
 operation,  supervision  and maintenance of the high school and shall be
 responsible for the administration of the high school, including curric-
 ulum, grading, discipline and staffing.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  the
 board  of  education  of the city school district of the city of Buffalo
 shall develop a comprehensive plan  outlining  the  project.  Such  plan
 shall  include:  an  estimate of the total project cost, including esti-
 mates on the design, reconstruction and  rehabilitation  costs  and  any
 administrative  costs for the project, attestation that the district has
 sufficient reserves to cover such costs and an outline of the time-frame
 expected for completion of the project.
  § 5. The city school district of the  city  of  Buffalo  shall  submit
 estimated project costs for the renovation and equipping of the Leonardo
 A. 7663--A  3
 
 da  Vinci High School after completion of schematic plans and specifica-
 tions for review by the commissioner of education. If the total  project
 costs  associated  with such project exceeds the approved cost allowance
 of  such building project and the city school district has not otherwise
 demonstrated to the satisfaction of the New York state education depart-
 ment the availability of additional reserves for such excess costs, then
 the district shall not proceed with the preparation of final  plans  and
 specifications for such project until the project has been redesigned or
 value-engineered  to  reduce estimated project costs so as not to exceed
 the above cost limits.
  § 6. The property authorized by this  act  to  be  leased  to  Buckham
 Development  Corporation  is  generally described as Buckham Hall and is
