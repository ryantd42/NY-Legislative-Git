  relation to crimes against vulnerable elderly or disabled persons

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 260.31 of the penal law, as added by chapter 381 of
 the laws of 1998, subdivision 1 as amended, subdivision 4 as  added  and
 such section as renumbered by chapter 14 of the laws of 2010, and subdi-
 vision  2  as  amended by chapter 193 of the laws of 2010, is amended to
 read as follows:
 § 260.31 Vulnerable elderly persons; definitions.
  For the purpose of sections 260.32 and 260.34  of  this  article,  the
 following definitions shall apply:
  1.  ["Caregiver" means a person who (i) assumes responsibility for the
 care of a vulnerable elderly person, or  an  incompetent  or  physically
 disabled  person pursuant to a court order; or (ii) receives monetary or
 other valuable consideration for providing care for a vulnerable elderly
 person, or an incompetent or physically disabled person.
  2.] "Sexual contact" means any touching of the sexual or  other  inti-
 mate  parts  of  a person for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of
 either party. It includes the touching of the actor by  the  victim,  as
 well  as  the  touching  of the victim by the actor, whether directly or
 through clothing, as well as the emission of ejaculate by the actor upon
 any part of the victim, clothed or unclothed.
  [3.] 2. "Vulnerable elderly person" means a person sixty years of  age
 or  older  who  is suffering from a disease or infirmity associated with
 advanced  age  and  manifested  by  demonstrable  physical,  mental  or
 emotional  dysfunction  to  the  extent  that the person is incapable of

 adequately providing for his or her own health or  personal  care  OR  A
 PERSON SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER.
  [4.]  3. "Incompetent or physically disabled person" means an individ-
 ual who is unable to care for himself or  herself  because  of  physical
 disability, mental disease or defect.
  §  2. The opening paragraph and subdivision 4 of section 260.32 of the
 penal law, as amended by chapter 14 of the laws of 2010, are amended  to
 read as follows:
  A  person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a vulnerable elderly
 person, or an incompetent or physically disabled person  in  the  second
 degree  when[,  being a caregiver for a vulnerable elderly person, or an
 incompetent or physically disabled person]:
  4. He or she subjects  such  person  to  sexual  contact  without  the
 latter's  consent.  Lack  of consent under this subdivision results from
 forcible compulsion or incapacity to consent, as those terms are defined
 in article one hundred thirty of  this  [chapter]  PART,  or  any  other
 circumstances  in which the vulnerable elderly person, or an incompetent
 or physically disabled person does not expressly or impliedly  acquiesce
 [in  the caregiver's conduct]. In any prosecution under this subdivision
 in which the victim's alleged lack of consent results solely from  inca-
 pacity  to  consent  because of the victim's mental disability or mental
 incapacity, the provisions of section  130.16  of  this  [chapter]  PART
 shall  apply.  In addition, in any prosecution under this subdivision in
 which the victim's lack of consent is based solely upon his or her inca-
 pacity to consent because he or  she  was  mentally  disabled,  mentally
 incapacitated  or physically helpless, it is an affirmative defense that
 the defendant, at the time he or she engaged in the conduct constituting
 the offense, did not know of the facts  or  conditions  responsible  for
 such incapacity to consent.
  §  3.  The  opening  paragraph  of section 260.34 of the penal law, as
 amended by chapter 14 of the  laws  of  2010,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  A  person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a vulnerable elderly
 person, or an incompetent or physically disabled  person  in  the  first
 degree  when[,  being a caregiver for a vulnerable elderly person, or an
 incompetent or physically disabled person]:
  § 4. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subdivision 1 of section 70.02  of  the
 penal  law,  paragraph (c) as amended by chapter 134 of the laws of 2019
 and paragraph (d) as amended by chapter 7  of  the  laws  of  2007,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  (c)  Class  D violent felony offenses: an attempt to commit any of the
 class C felonies set forth in paragraph (b); reckless assault of a child
