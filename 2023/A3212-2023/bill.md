 AN ACT authorizing the city of Yonkers to create a  safe  city  streets,

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The legislature hereby finds and declares that  the  safety
 of  the  people of the city of Yonkers is of paramount concern, and that
 the city faces unique  and  extraordinary  problems  in  providing  such
 services  to  its  people.  The  variety of state legislative enactments
 specific to the city, the unique tax structure of the city,  significant
 increases  in  local  taxes,  and  the  need  for a return to stable and
 accountable government require the  state  to  encourage,  approve,  and
 authorize a comprehensive budget solution.
  The  choices  made  by  the  city government for the resolution of the
 budget crisis, and the provision of  the  necessary  level  of  services
 require state authorization of a "safe streets, safe city, safe schools"
 program as part of the resolution of the city's budget crisis.
  §  2.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the city of Yonkers
 is hereby authorized to establish a separate safe  streets,  safe  city,
 safe  schools  special account for funds from revenue sources authorized
 and dedicated therefor by the state. Moneys in  such  account  shall  be
 used  solely  for  programs  to enhance public safety in the streets and
 schools in the city of Yonkers pursuant to a safe  streets,  safe  city,
 safe schools plan adopted by the city of Yonkers.
  § 3.  This act shall take effect immediately.
