BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMENDING the Rome Arts and Community Center upon
  the  occasion of celebrating its 55th Anniversary on
  September 9, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Rome Art and Community Center (RACC) upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating  its  55th Anniversary at their Gala on Friday, September 9,
2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, RACC is Rome, New York's only multi-arts facility, offering
both cultural and community programming at little  or  no  cost  to  the
public;  this  exceptional  art  center  welcomes  almost 5,000 visitors
annually, including visitors from all over the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Highly committed to making programming accessible  to  all,
regardless  of  age,  race,  economic  status  or physical ability, this
center continues to be a true asset to its community and in addition, is
also a home away from home for hundreds of artists  each  year,  whether
they  exhibit  their  engaging  works  in  the galleries or are featured
performers; and
 
  WHEREAS, RACC offers unique opportunities to experience the arts  on
a very personal level, whether it be through hands-on instruction, quiet
walks  through  a  serene  gallery  space,  or even as a part of a large
community event; this extraordinary environment has been a part  of  the
Rome  community  since  1967,  and  continues  to  impact  the  lives of
children, teens, and adults every year since; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Gala is  a  celebration  of  55  years  of  commitment
bringing  arts and culture to the greater Rome community; many people in
the community believe the art center  is  a  place  that  instills  fond
memories  of  taking  art  classes,  having piano recitals, or attending
great events, and the  RACC  wishes  to  celebrate  those  memories  and
connections with everyone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion provides RACC with a platform to
pay tribute to local businesses that have supported the art  center  for
many years: Olney's Flowers, Engelbert Jewelers, and Ann Lynch Interiors
have been instrumental in their support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Rome  Art  and  Community  Center  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating its 55th Anniversary on September 9, 2022; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Rome Art and Community Center.
