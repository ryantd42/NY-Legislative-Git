 PERIOD TO OVERRIDE DUE TO  EXTENUATING  CIRCUMSTANCES  THAT  NECESSITATE
 ADDITIONAL  TIME.  THE OVERRIDE NOTICE SHALL STAY THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE

 OR MOTION FROM CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD  PENDING  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  A
 DIRECTIVE  BY  THE  MONITOR  OR  MONITORS.  THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MUST

 NO  LATER THAN 10 DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE OF SUCH OVERRIDE. UPON THE ISSU-
 ANCE OF A DIRECTIVE, THE OVERRIDE OF THE  BOARD'S  ADOPTED  OR  PROPOSED

 DIRECTIVE.  THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY EXTEND THE PERIOD TO SUBMIT SUCH
 DIRECTIVE, AT INTERVALS OF 10 ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR EACH EXTENSION, IF THE

 RELEVANT INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE MONITOR OR MONITORS RELATED TO THE
 ADOPTED OR PROPOSED RESOLUTION OR MOTION SUBJECT TO SUCH OVERRIDE WITHIN
 48 HOURS OF SUCH REQUEST.
  (B)  SUBMIT  A  RESOLUTION  FOR  ADOPTION BY THE BOARD. THE RESOLUTION

 SUPERINTENDENT AND COMMISSIONER ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC FINDINGS  AS  TO
 THE NECESSITY OF SUCH RESOLUTION. THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY DIRECT THE
 BOARD  TO  MEET AT A DATE PRIOR TO THEIR NEXT SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING TO
 TAKE UP SUCH RESOLUTION. THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY WITHDRAW THE RESOL-
 UTION PRIOR TO, OR DURING, THE NEXT BOARD MEETING, IF  THE  BOARD  TAKES
 SUFFICIENT  ACTION TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES CONTAINED IN THE RESOLUTION. IF
 THE RESOLUTION IS NOT WITHDRAWN, IT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE ADOPTED AT THE
 NEXT BOARD MEETING THROUGH ITS SUBMISSION AND SHALL HAVE THE FULL  FORCE
 AND EFFECT AS ANY OTHER RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE BOARD.
  (C)  THE MONITOR OR MONITORS SHALL NOT OVERRIDE AN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED
 RESOLUTION OR MOTION  OR  SUBMIT  A  RESOLUTION  RELATED  TO  COLLECTIVE
 BARGAINING  AGREEMENTS  NEGOTIATED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 14 OF THE
 CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
  4. THE MONITOR OR  MONITORS  MAY  DIRECT  THE  BOARD,  SUPERINTENDENT,
 AND/OR  OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICERS TO UNDERGO ANY TRAINING AS DEEMED
 NECESSARY AND PURSUANT TO TIMELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE MONITOR  OR
 MONITORS.
  5.  THE  MONITOR OR MONITORS SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO APPROVE OR DISAP-
 PROVE THE APPOINTMENT OF A SUPERINTENDENT BY THE BOARD OF  EDUCATION  ON
 OR  AFTER  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF THIS ACT. THE BOARD SHALL SUBMIT THE
 RECOMMENDATION  FOR  SUPERINTENDENT  TO  THE  MONITOR  OR  MONITORS  FOR
 APPROVAL.  THE  MONITOR  OR  MONITORS  SHALL  HAVE 10 DAYS TO APPROVE OR

 APPROVED BY THE MONITOR OR MONITORS. IN THE EVENT THAT A VACANCY  OCCURS
 IN  THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT DUE TO THE DISAPPROVAL OF A RECOMMEN-
 DATION, THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY APPOINT A CURRENT SCHOOL EMPLOYEE AS
 INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT UNTIL  A  RECOMMENDATION  FOR  SUPERINTENDENT  IS
