 MEDICAL RECORDS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  (B)  RECORDS  DISCLOSED  PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION

 CATION  AND SHALL NOT BE USED FOR ANY AUDITING FUNCTION OR TO DETECT ANY

 OTHERWISE AVAILABLE IN AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD.
  (C)  HEALTH  PLANS  UTILIZING  ELECTRONIC  MEDICAL  RECORDS UNDER THIS

 INSUREDS'  DATA,  INCLUDING  THEIR  PROTECTED  HEALTH  INFORMATION  AND
 PERSONALLY  IDENTIFIABLE  INFORMATION. TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE AND NECES-
