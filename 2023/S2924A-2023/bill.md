  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The Legislature finds that any relief
 and long-term recovery from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandem-
 ic must recognize the disproportionate burden  mothers  have  weathered.
 Women,  especially  mothers,  have faced the brunt of the economic chal-
 lenges of the pandemic due to social barriers and policy  failures  that
 have been compounded by enduring racism and gender injustices, including
 the  lack  of care infrastructure, lack of family-supportive workplaces,
 and gender and racial pay inequities.
  Women continue to face unjust gender and racial  wage  gaps,  and  are
 overrepresented  in  low-wage  jobs,  despite  their  gains in workforce
 participation.  Asian-American and Pacific Islander women,  particularly
 Southeast  Asian  and Pacific Islander women, get paid as little as $.50
 for every dollar a White man makes. Black  women  make  only  $0.63  for
 every  dollar  a  White  man makes, and as a result may lose $946,000 in
 their lifetimes.  Latina women earn $0.55 for every dollar earned  by  a
 White  man,  and  as a result may lose over $1,100,000 in wages over the
 course of a 40-year career. Native American women  are  paid  $0.60  for
 every  dollar a White man makes and are murdered at 10 times the rate of
 the national average, even though financial  independence  and  security
 can increase chances of escaping violence for these women. Women's wages
 are  key  to their families' economic security and survival.  Across the
 country, mothers are breadwinners in almost half of families with  chil-
 dren  under 18, even though mothers face a greater pay gap than women as
 a whole. Even prior to the pandemic,  working  mothers  faced  continued

 biases  and  stigmas  in  the workplace that caregiving responsibilities
 will negatively impact their work performance.
  Women  have  suffered  the  majority  of  pandemic-related job losses.
 Since February 2020, women have lost over 5,400,000 net jobs and account
 for 55% of overall net job loss since the beginning of the crisis. Women
 of color are experiencing higher rates of job  loss  than  White  women.
 According  to  the  Bureau of Labor Statistics January 2021 unemployment
 data, the jobless rate for Black women and Latina women aged 20 and over
 is over 60%  higher  than  their  White  counterparts.  Asian  Americans
 recorded  the  highest jobless rates among women in the last 6 months of
 2020, even though before the pandemic their  average  unemployment  rate
 was the lowest.
  Women  face  a disproportionate burden of caregiving responsibilities.
 Mothers are three times more likely than fathers to be  responsible  for
 most  of  the  caregiving  and household work.  Single mothers are more
 likely than other parents to take care of all  housework  and  childcare
 responsibilities  in  their  household,  and  are more likely than other
 mothers to experience financial insecurity.
  Throughout the pandemic, women of color have played integral roles  on
 the  frontlines  as  essential workers, including as nursing assistants,
 home health aides, and child care educators.
  The unprecedented burdens of child care,  work,  and  remote  learning
 have  strained  mental and emotional health for mothers. These points of
 stressor are compounded  by  financial  instability,  racial  injustice,
 being  a  single  parent,  having  children with special needs, and many
 other factors.
  § 2. 1. There is hereby established an interagency task  force  hereby
 known  as  the  Marshall plan for moms intergency task force which shall

 and other caregivers, and the impact of access or availability to mental

 such programs on immigrant families and the state.
  8.  Any  other  areas  the  task force deems relevant in the review of
 policies that may impact mothers and other caregivers.
  § 4. Within one year of the effective date of this  act,  in  carrying

 also accept public input in writing.  The task force may utilize  remote
 access  such  as web conferencing in order to comply with the provisions
 of this section.
