 are available under section 361 and section 361-a of the retirement  and
 social  security  law.  Upon  filing, David Morse shall be eligible to

 death  benefit,  payable  due  to the death of their child Peyton Morse,
 pursuant to Sections 361 and 361-a of the Retirement and Social Security
 Law (RSSL). Peyton Morse was a  firefighter  employed  by  the  City  of
 Watertown  and  a member of the New York State and Local Police and Fire
 Retirement System until  March  12,  2021,  the  date  of  their  death.
