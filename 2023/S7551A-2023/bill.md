 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  criminal  procedure law, the executive law, the
  correction law, the  judiciary  law  and  the  civil  rights  law,  in
  relation to automatic sealing of certain convictions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative  intent.  Almost  fifty  years  ago,  New  York
 enacted  anti-discrimination  protections  for  individuals with a prior
 criminal conviction. In his approval message, Governor Carey noted  that
 the  expense and time involved in prosecuting and incarcerating an indi-
 vidual is largely wasted "if upon the individual's return to society his
 willingness to assume a law abiding and productive role is frustrated by
 senseless discrimination" and further noted that  providing  a  formerly
 incarcerated  individual  "a  fair  opportunity for a job is a matter of
 basic human fairness as well as one of the surest ways to reduce crime."
  He also noted that the legislation in no way required  the  hiring  of
 someone  with  a criminal record but provided reasonable standards to be
 applied when considering the employment of such an individual, and  that
 merely  having a criminal record could not be the sole basis for denying
 employment. While New York has made great strides in fighting  discrimi-
 nation - on the basis of many attributes, experiences, and circumstances
 of  New  Yorkers - discrimination on the basis of past convictions still
 persists.
  Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to  further  curb  this
 discrimination  by  sealing from public access the conviction records of
 individuals for certain state convictions only after an  individual  has

 satisfied  their  sentence  and  the required period of time has passed,
 within which the individual has remained a  law  abiding  citizen  while
 ensuring  that this otherwise sealed conviction information will remain
 accessible  for  law  enforcement  and  other  relevant  and  necessary
 purposes.  These relevant and necessary purposes  include  but  are  not
 limited to determining suitability for licensing, employment and similar
 activities  where  federal or state law requires  a criminal background
 check be performed prior to granting licenses to or  employing  individ-
 uals  in  certain  jobs, such as employment with children, elderly popu-
 lations, or other vulnerable populations, as well as  where  federal  or
 state  law authorizes  a criminal background check to be performed prior
 to the same type of employment or similar activity.
  It is further the intent of  the  legislature  that  this  legislation
 shall not have any impact on, nor will it change the access to, informa-
 tion  regarding  out  of state or federal conviction information for law
 enforcement purposes or any other person or entity,  including  prospec-
 tive employers, accessing an individual's criminal history through crim-
 inal background checks or through publicly accessible records.
  §  2.  The  criminal  procedure law is amended by adding a new section
 160.57 to read as follows:
