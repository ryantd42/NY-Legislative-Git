 sexual orientation of a person, regardless  of  whether  the  belief  or
 perception  is  correct,  or  any  person  who  aids or incites any such
 conduct, shall be liable, in a civil action or proceeding maintained  by
 such individual or group of individuals, for injunctive relief, damages,
 or  any other appropriate relief in law or equity. If it shall appear to
 the satisfaction of the court or justice that  the  respondent  has,  in
 fact,  violated  this section, an injunction may be issued by such court
 or justice, enjoining and restraining  any  further  violation,  without
 requiring  proof  that  any person has, in fact, been injured or damaged
 thereby. For the purposes of this subdivision, a person lacks reason  to
 suspect  a violation of the penal law, any other criminal conduct, or an
 imminent threat to a person or property where a reasonable person  would
 not suspect such violation, conduct, or threat.
  §  4.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
