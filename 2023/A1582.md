 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to establishment
  of a reverse mortgage loan program for seniors

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares
 that  many  senior  citizens  living in New York own their own homes and
 want to continue to live at home for as long  as  possible.  Nationally,
 with over two trillion dollars tied up in home equity, reverse mortgages
 have  the  potential  to dramatically increase the ability of seniors to
 pay for their long-term care and remain  in  their  homes.  Today,  over
 eighty  percent  of  older  Americans own their own homes, seventy-three
 percent of which are owned free and clear of  any  mortgages.  Unlocking
 these resources can help "house-rich and cash-poor" seniors purchase the
 long-term  care  services they feel best meet their needs. Private funds
 from reverse mortgages also  can  strengthen  community  long-term  care
 systems  and  reduce the burden on state and local Medicaid budgets. The
 purpose of this act is to establish  a  reverse  mortgage  loan  program
 within  the state of New York mortgage agency to enable elderly homeown-
 ers to stay at home and pay for their long-term care.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 2405-g to read as follows:
  §  2405-G.  REVERSE  MORTGAGE  LOAN PROGRAM FOR SENIORS.  (1) AUTHORI-
 ZATION. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE AGENCY
 IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO ESTABLISH A REVERSE  MORTGAGE  LOAN
 PROGRAM  FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING SENIOR HOMEOWNERS TO USE THE EQUITY
 IN THEIR HOMES TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LONG-TERM  CARE  NEEDS.  THE  SUPER-
 INTENDENT  OF  FINANCIAL SERVICES IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO VARY ANY RULES
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
