  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision  3  of section 79-b of the navigation law, as
 amended by section 1 of part D of chapter 109 of the laws  of  2010,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  3.  The  amount  of state aid to be allocated to eligible governmental
 entities pursuant to this article shall be determined by the commission-
 er  as  hereinafter  provided.  The  commissioner  shall  determine  the
 percentage proportion which the authorized expenditures of each individ-
 ual  entity, not exceeding four hundred thousand dollars for each county
 including municipalities therein, shall bear  to  the  total  authorized
 expenditures  of  all entities. Such percentage proportion shall then be
 applied against an amount equal to one-half of the total of  the  amount
 received by the state in each preceding program year in vessel registra-
 tion  fees  as  provided  in section twenty-two hundred fifty-one of the
 vehicle and traffic law, less no more than thirty  percent,  subject  to
 appropriation, which may be used by the commissioner and the commission-
 er  of motor vehicles for administrative costs of the program, including
 training and equipment, and by the department of environmental conserva-
 tion, the division of state police and other state agencies, subject  to
 the approval of the commissioner, for the purposes of this article, plus
 the  entire  amount  received  pursuant  to  subdivision nine of section
 forty-four of this chapter. The amount thus determined shall  constitute
 the maximum amount of state aid to which each such entity shall be enti-
 tled;  provided, however, that [no entity shall receive] state aid SHALL
 BE PROVIDED in an amount [in excess] of [fifty] SEVENTY-FIVE percent  of

 its  authorized  expenditures  as  approved by the commissioner for such
 program year. The commissioner shall  certify  to  the  comptroller  the
 amount  thus  determined  for each eligible local governmental entity as
 the amount of state aid to be apportioned to such eligible local govern-
 mental  entity.  The  allocation  of  state aid to any county, town or
 village within the Lake George park shall not be reduced because of  the
 allocation  of  state  aid  to  the  Lake George park commission. Of the
 remaining funds received by the state for the registration of vessels as
 provided in section twenty-two hundred  fifty-one  of  the  vehicle  and
 traffic  law,  no  less  than six percent shall be made available to the
 commissioner for the expenses of the office in providing navigation  law
 enforcement training and administering the provisions of this section.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.
