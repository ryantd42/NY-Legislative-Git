 Introduced  by Sen. HARCKHAM -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to local block anesthesia
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Section  6605-b of the education law, as added by chapter
 437 of the laws of 2001 and subdivision 1 as amended by chapter  198  of
 the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 6605-b.  Dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND BLOCK
 anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia certificate.  1. A  dental  hygienist
 shall  not administer or monitor nitrous oxide analgesia or local infil-
 tration OR BLOCK anesthesia in the practice of dental hygiene without  a
 dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND  BLOCK
 anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia  certificate  and  except  under  the
 personal  supervision  of  a  dentist and in accordance with regulations
 promulgated by the commissioner. Personal supervision, for  purposes  of
 this  section,  means that the supervising dentist remains in the dental
 office where the local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia or nitrous oxide
 analgesia  services  are  being  performed,  personally  authorizes  and
 prescribes  the use of local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia or nitrous
 oxide analgesia for the patient and, before dismissal  of  the  patient,
 personally  examines the condition of the patient after the use of local
 infiltration  OR  BLOCK  anesthesia  or  nitrous  oxide  analgesia  is
 completed.  It  is  professional  misconduct  for  a  dentist to fail to
 provide the supervision required by this section, and any dentist  found
 guilty  of  such  misconduct  under the procedures prescribed in section
 sixty-five hundred ten of this title shall be subject to  the  penalties
 prescribed in section sixty-five hundred eleven of this title.
  2.  The  commissioner shall promulgate regulations establishing stand-
 ards and procedures for the issuance of such certificate. Such standards
 shall require completion of an  educational  program  and/or  course  of

 training  or  experience sufficient to ensure that a dental hygienist is
 specifically trained in the administration  and  monitoring  of  nitrous
 oxide analgesia and local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia, the possible
 effects  of such use, and in the recognition of and response to possible
 emergency situations.
  3. The fee for a dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND
 BLOCK  anesthesia/nitrous  oxide  analgesia certificate shall be twenty-
 five dollars and shall be paid on a triennial basis upon renewal of such
 certificate. A certificate may be  suspended  or  revoked  in  the  same
 manner as a license to practice dental hygiene.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 6606 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 239 of the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  The practice of the profession of dental hygiene is defined as the
 performance of dental services which shall include  removing  calcareous
 deposits,  accretions  and stains from the exposed surfaces of the teeth
 which begin at the epithelial attachment  and  applying  topical  agents
 indicated for a complete dental prophylaxis, removing cement, placing or
 removing  rubber  dam,  removing sutures, placing matrix band, providing
 patient education, applying topical  medication,  placing  and  exposing
 diagnostic  dental X-ray films, performing topical fluoride applications
 and topical anesthetic applications,  polishing  teeth,  taking  medical
 history,  charting  caries,  taking impressions for study casts, placing
 and  removing  temporary  restorations,  administering  and  monitoring
 nitrous  oxide  analgesia  and administering and monitoring local infil-
 tration AND BLOCK anesthesia, subject  to  certification  in  accordance
 with  section  sixty-six  hundred  five-b of this article, and any other
 function in the definition of the practice of dentistry as may be deleg-
 ated by a licensed dentist in accordance with regulations promulgated by
 the commissioner. The practice of dental hygiene may be conducted in the
 office of any licensed dentist or in any appropriately  equipped  school
 or public institution but must be done either under the supervision of a
 licensed  dentist or, in the case of a registered dental hygienist work-
 ing for a hospital as defined in  article  twenty-eight  of  the  public
 health  law, pursuant to a collaborative arrangement with a licensed and
 registered dentist who has a formal relationship with the same  hospital
 in  accordance with regulations promulgated by the department in consul-
 tation with the department of  health.  Such  collaborative  arrangement
 shall  not  obviate  or  supersede  any law or regulation which requires
 identified services to be performed under the personal supervision of  a
 dentist.  When dental hygiene services are provided pursuant to a colla-
 borative agreement, such dental hygienist shall instruct individuals  to
 visit a licensed dentist for comprehensive examination or treatment.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
