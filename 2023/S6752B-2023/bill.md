  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  6605-b of the education law, as added by chapter
 437 of the laws of 2001 and subdivision 1 as amended by chapter  198  of
 the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 6605-b.  Dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration
 anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia certificate.  1. A dental  hygienist,
 EXCEPT  AS  OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, shall
 not administer or monitor nitrous oxide analgesia or local  infiltration
 anesthesia  in  the  practice of dental hygiene without a dental hygiene
 restricted local infiltration anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia certif-
 icate and except under the personal supervision  of  a  dentist  and  in
 accordance  with  regulations  promulgated by the commissioner. Personal
 supervision, for purposes of this section, means  that  the  supervising
 dentist  remains in the dental office where the local infiltration anes-
 thesia  or  nitrous  oxide  analgesia  services  are  being  performed,
 personally authorizes and prescribes the use of local infiltration anes-
 thesia  or nitrous oxide analgesia for the patient and, before dismissal
 of the patient, personally examines the condition of the  patient  after
 the  use  of local infiltration anesthesia or nitrous oxide analgesia is
 completed. It is professional  misconduct  for  a  dentist  to  fail  to
 provide  the supervision required by this section, and any dentist found
 guilty of such misconduct under the  procedures  prescribed  in  section

 ated by a licensed dentist in accordance with regulations promulgated by
 the commissioner. The practice of dental hygiene may be conducted in the
 office  of  any licensed dentist or in any appropriately equipped school
 or public institution but must be done either under the supervision of a
 licensed dentist or, in the case of a registered dental hygienist  work-

 health law, pursuant to a collaborative arrangement with a licensed  and
 registered  dentist who has a formal relationship with the same hospital
 in accordance with regulations promulgated by the department in  consul-

 borative  agreement, such dental hygienist shall instruct individuals to
