  A  reporting  individual  need not disclose activities performed while
 lawfully acting in his or her capacity as provided  in  paragraphs  (c),
 (d),  (e)  and (f) of subdivision seven of section seventy-three of this
 article.
 The disclosure requirement  in  questions  (b-1)  and  (b-2)  shall  not
 require  disclosing  clients  or customers receiving medical, pharmaceu-
 tical or dental services, mental health services,  or  residential  real
 estate  brokering  services  from the reporting individual or his or her
 firm or if federal law prohibits or  limits  disclosure.  The  reporting
 individual  need not identify any client to whom he or she or his or her
 firm provided legal representation  with  respect  to  investigation  or
 prosecution  by  law  enforcement authorities, bankruptcy, family court,
 estate planning, or domestic relations matters, nor shall the  reporting
 individual  identify  individuals  represented  pursuant to an insurance
 policy but the reporting individual shall  in  such  circumstances  only
 report  the  entity that provides compensation to the reporting individ-
 ual; with respect to matters in which the client's name is  required  by
 law  to  be  kept  confidential  (such as matters governed by the family
 court act) or in matters in which the reporting individual represents or
 provides services to minors, the client's  name  may  be  replaced  with
 initials.  To  the  extent  that the reporting individual, or his or her
 firm, provided legal representation with respect to  an  initial  public
 offering,  and  professional  disciplinary  rules,  federal law or regu-
 lations restrict the disclosure of information relating  to  such  work,
 the  reporting  individual shall (i) disclose the identity of the client
 and the services provided relating to the initial public offering to the
 office of court  administration,  who  will  maintain  such  information
 confidentially  in a locked box; and (ii) include in his or her response
 to questions (b-1) and (b-2) that pursuant to this paragraph, a  disclo-
 sure to the office of court administration has been made. Upon such time
 that  the  disclosure  of information maintained in the locked box is no
 longer restricted by professional disciplinary  rules,  federal  law  or
 regulation,  the reporting individual shall disclose such information in
 an amended disclosure statement in response to the  disclosure  require-
 ments  in  questions (b-1) and (b-2). The office of court administration
 shall develop and maintain a secure  portal  through  which  information
 submitted  to  it pursuant to this paragraph can be safely and confiden-
 tially stored. With respect to clients represented in other matters  not
 otherwise  exempt,  the reporting individual may request an exemption to
 A. 2496  22
 
 publicly disclosing the name of that  client  from  the  [commission  on
 ethics and lobbying in government pursuant to section ninety-four of the
 executive  law]  DEPARTMENT  OF OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION, or from the
 office of court administration. In such application, the reporting indi-
 vidual  shall state the following: "My client is not currently receiving
 my services or seeking my services in connection with:  (i) A  proposed
 bill  or resolution in the senate or assembly during the reporting peri-
 od;
  (ii) A contract in an amount totaling $10,000 or more from  the  state
 or any state agency for services, materials, or property;
  (iii)  A  grant  of $10,000 or more from the state or any state agency
 during the reporting period;
  (iv) A grant obtained through  a  legislative  initiative  during  the
 reporting period; or
  (v)  A  case,  proceeding,  application  or other matter that is not a
 ministerial matter before a state agency during the reporting period."
  In reviewing the request for an exemption, the [commission  on  ethics
 and lobbying in government] DEPARTMENT OF OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION or
 the office of court administration may consult with bar or other profes-
 sional  associations  and the legislative ethics commission for individ-
 uals subject to its jurisdiction and may consider the rules  of  profes-
 sional  conduct.  In making its determination, the [commission on ethics
 and lobbying in government] DEPARTMENT OF OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION or
 the office of court administration shall conduct  its  own  inquiry  and
 shall consider factors including, but not limited to: (i) the nature and
 the  size of the client; (ii) whether the client has any business before
 the state; and if so, how significant the business is; and  whether  the
 client  has any particularized interest in pending legislation and if so
 how significant the interest is; (iii)  whether  disclosure  may  reveal
 trade secrets; (iv) whether disclosure could reasonably result in retal-
 iation  against  the client; (v) whether disclosure may cause undue harm
 to the client; (vi) whether disclosure may result in undue harm  to  the
 attorney-client relationship; and (vii) whether disclosure may result in
 an unnecessary invasion of privacy to the client.
  The  [commission  on  ethics and lobbying in government] DEPARTMENT OF
 OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION or, as the case may be, the office of  court
 administration  shall promptly make a final determination in response to
 such request, which shall include an explanation for its  determination.
 The  office  of court administration shall issue its final determination
 within three days of receiving the request.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of law or any professional disciplinary rule to the contrary,
 the disclosure of the identity of any client or customer in response  to
 this  question  shall not constitute professional misconduct or a ground
 for disciplinary action of any kind, or form the basis for any civil  or
 criminal cause of action or proceeding. A reporting individual who first
 enters public office after January first, two thousand sixteen, need not
 report  clients  or  customers  with  respect  to  matters for which the
 reporting individual or his or her firm was retained prior  to  entering
 public office.
  (c)  APPLICABLE ONLY TO NEW CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS FOR WHOM SERVICES ARE

 individual a client who was successfully referred to the reporting indi-
 vidual's business  and  from  whom  the  reporting  individual  or  firm
 received  a  fee for services in excess of five thousand dollars. Report
 only those referrals that were made to a reporting individual by  direct
 communication  from  a person known to such reporting individual to be a
 registered lobbyist at the time the referral is made.  With  respect  to
 each  such referral, the reporting individual shall identify the client,
 the registered lobbyist who has made the referral, the category of value
 of the compensation received and a general description of  the  type  of
 matter  so referred. A reporting individual need not disclose activities
 performed while lawfully acting pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and
 (f) of subdivision seven of section seventy-three of this  article.  The
 disclosure  requirements  in  this question shall not require disclosing
 clients  or  customers  receiving  medical,  pharmaceutical  or  dental
 services,  mental  health services, or residential real estate brokering
 services from the reporting individual or his or her firm or if  federal
 law  prohibits  or  limits disclosure. The reporting individual need not
 identify any client to whom he or she or his or her firm provided  legal
 representation  with  respect  to  investigation  or  prosecution by law
 enforcement authorities, bankruptcy, family court, estate  planning,  or
 domestic  relations matters, nor shall the reporting individual identify
 individuals represented pursuant to an insurance policy but the  report-
 ing  individual  shall in such circumstances only report the entity that
 provides compensation to  the  reporting  individual;  with  respect  to
 matters  in which the client's name is required by law to be kept confi-
 dential (such as matters governed by the family court act) or in matters
 in which the reporting individual represents  or  provides  services  to
 minors,  the  client's name may be replaced with initials. To the extent
 that the reporting individual, or his or her firm, provided legal repre-
 sentation with respect to an initial public offering, and federal law or
 regulations restricts the disclosure of  information  relating  to  such
 work,  the  reporting  individual shall (i) disclose the identity of the
 client and the services provided relating to the initial public offering
 to the office of court administration, who will maintain  such  informa-
 tion  confidentially  in  a  locked  box; and (ii) include in his or her
 response a statement that pursuant to this paragraph,  a  disclosure  to
 the  office  of  court administration has been made. Upon such time that
 the disclosure of information maintained in the locked box is no  longer
 restricted  by federal law or regulation, the reporting individual shall
 disclose such information in an amended disclosure statement in response
 to the disclosure requirements of this paragraph.  The office  of  court
 administration  shall develop and maintain a secure portal through which
 information submitted to it pursuant to this paragraph can be safely and
 confidentially stored. With respect  to  clients  represented  in  other
 matters  not  otherwise  exempt, the reporting individual may request an
 exemption to publicly disclosing  the  name  of  that  client  from  the
 [commission  on  ethics  and  lobbying in government pursuant to section
 ninety-four of the executive law] DEPARTMENT OF OVERSIGHT  AND  INVESTI-
 GATION, or from the office of court administration. In such application,
 the  reporting  individual  shall state the following: "My client is not
 currently receiving my services or seeking  my  services  in  connection
 with:
  (i) A proposed bill or resolution in the senate or assembly during the
 reporting period;
 A. 2496  24

  (ii)  A  contract in an amount totaling $10,000 or more from the state

 the office of court administration may consult with bar or other profes-
 sional  associations  and the legislative ethics commission for individ-
 uals subject to its jurisdiction and may consider the rules  of  profes-
 sional  conduct.  In making its determination, the [commission on ethics

 an unnecessary invasion of privacy to the client.
  The  [commission  on  ethics and lobbying in government] DEPARTMENT OF
 OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION or, as the case may be, the office of  court
 administration  shall promptly make a final determination in response to
 such request, which shall include an explanation for its  determination.
 The  office  of court administration shall issue its final determination
 within three days of receiving the request.  Notwithstanding  any  other

 the disclosure of the identity of any client or customer in response  to
 this  question  shall not constitute professional misconduct or a ground
 for disciplinary action of any kind, or form the basis for any civil  or
 criminal cause of action or proceeding. A reporting individual who first
 enters  public office after December thirty-first, two thousand fifteen,

 which such individual knows to be false on such statement  of  financial
 disclosure  filed  pursuant  to this section shall be subject to a civil
 penalty in an amount not to exceed forty thousand dollars. Assessment of
 a civil penalty hereunder shall be made by the [commission on ethics and

 ized.  Such  rules,  which shall not be subject to the approval require-
 ments of the state administrative procedure act, shall provide  for  due
 process  procedural  mechanisms substantially similar to those set forth

 or scope. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be final unless  modified,
 suspended  or vacated within thirty days of imposition and upon becoming

 ration  or  association, to render services to any state agency when the
 agency head certifies in writing to the [commission on ethics and lobby-
 ing in government] DEPARTMENT OF OVERSIGHT AND  INVESTIGATION  that  the
 services  of  such former officer or employee are required in connection

  §  20.  Subdivision  8-a  of section 73 of the public officers law, as
 amended by chapter 357 of the laws of 2001 and the opening paragraph  as
 amended  by  section 17 of part QQ of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is
 amended to read as follows:
  8-a. The provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a)  of
 subdivision  eight  of  this  section shall not apply to any such former
 state officer or employee engaged  in  any  of  the  specific  permitted
 activities  defined  in  this  subdivision that are related to any civil
 action or proceeding in any state or federal court,  provided  that  the
 attorney  general  has certified in writing to the [commission on ethics
 and lobbying in government] DEPARTMENT OF OVERSIGHT  AND  INVESTIGATION,
 with  a copy to such former state officer or employee, that the services
 are rendered on behalf of the state, a state agency,  state  officer  or
 employee, or other person or entity represented by the attorney general,
 and  that such former state officer or employee has expertise, knowledge
 or experience which is unique or outstanding in a field or in a  partic-
 ular  matter  or  which  would  otherwise  be generally unavailable at a
 comparable cost to the state, a state agency, state officer or employee,
 or other person or entity represented by the attorney  general  in  such
 civil  action  or proceeding. In those instances where a state agency is
 not represented by the attorney general in a civil action or  proceeding
 in state or federal court, a former state officer or employee may engage
 in  permitted  activities provided that the general counsel of the state
 agency, after consultation with the [commission on ethics  and  lobbying
 in  government]  DEPARTMENT  OF OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION, provides to
 [the commission on ethics and lobbying in government] SUCH DEPARTMENT  a
 written  certification which meets the requirements of this subdivision.
