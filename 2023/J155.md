  CELEBRATING Orthodox Christmas on January 7, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to celebrate Orthodox
Christmas on January 7, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Orthodox  Christians  in  the  United  States  celebrate
Christmas a little bit later than everyone else, on  January  7th;  this
date falls on December 25th in the Julian Calendar, which existed before
the Gregorian Calendar; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  Orthodox  Christmas  celebrates the birth of
Jesus Christ, the son of God; this holiday differs  from  Christmas  Day
because  it does not observe Pagan traditions, such as waiting for gifts
from Santa Claus and decorating a tree, and instead focuses on religious
customs; and
 
  WHEREAS, While Orthodox  Christmas  is  more  widely  celebrated  in
Eastern  European countries, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbian communities
in the United States who observed Orthodox Christianism also wait  until
January 7th to celebrate their Christmas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Christmas  falls on a different day in the Orthodox Church
because they still observe the traditional Julian  calendar,  which  has
the  original  dates  for  Christian  celebrations  before the Gregorian
calendar was introduced; this means that, technically, Orthodox churches
still observe Christmas on December 25th; and
 
  WHEREAS, Orthodox Christmas celebrates the birth  of  Jesus  Christ,
even  though his actual birthdate is unknown; because Orthodox Christmas
is celebrated using the old Julian calendar, it is  also  known  as  Old
Christmas Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Orthodox  Christmas  focuses  on  religious  rituals  and
traditions; it is a time to find peace and unity and heal the  soul;  as
such,  they do not observe commercialized tradition such as the exchange
of presents or decorating the tree; in addition, many people  observe  a
fast  before  Orthodox Christmas day and give up things such as meat and
dairy; and
 
  WHEREAS, A holiday centered  around  peace  and  serenity,  Orthodox
Christians  decorate  their  table  with  a  white  table  cloth  which
symbolizes the cloth Jesus was wrapped in when he was  born;  some  also
put  candles  and  straw decorations up to represent the nativity scene;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Orthodox Christmas meal is known as  the  Holy  Supper,
and some traditional foods eaten on the day are mushroom soup, porridge,
Lenten bread, nuts and dried fruits, cod, biscuits, and honey; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Orthodox  Churches  in  the  United  States hold a special
liturgy, where they light a fire with palms  and  burn  frankincense  in
honor of the three wise men's gifts to Jesus; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is fitting and proper to give thanks to God by observing
Orthodox  Christmas  in  New York State on January 7, 2023, when all may
acknowledge  our  blessings  and  express  gratitude  for  them,  while
recognizing the need for strengthening religious and moral values in our
State and nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate Orthodox Christmas on January 7, 2023.
