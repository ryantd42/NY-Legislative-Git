  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 17, 2023, as Direct Caregivers Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the conviction of this Legislative Body that those
individuals who faithfully serve the needs  of  the  community  and  its
citizens  with  diligence  and  compassionate  commitment  profoundly
strengthen our shared commitment to family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is, furthermore, the sense of this Legislative  Body  to
recognize  the  efforts of direct caregivers who, in providing essential
care and support to people in the communities  across  New  York  State,
serve  to  enhance  the  quality of life for some of our most vulnerable
residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concerns, and in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  17,  2023,  as
Direct Caregivers Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Direct caregivers are a vital lifeline to those they serve,
as well as to families and friends struggling to provide quality care to
their  loved  ones; they provide the bulk of the paid hands-on long-term
care and personal assistance received by Americans who  are  elderly  or
living with disabilities or chronic conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Direct  caregivers provide a broad range of critical tasks
and  services  that  improve  the  lives  of  those  who  need  home  or
residential  care;  they  assist  individuals  with  activities of daily
living, perform clinical tasks,  help  with  homemaking  and  medication
management,  help  consumers  remain  engaged  in their communities, and
serve as the eyes and ears for licensed professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Direct caregivers also constitute one of  the  largest  and
fastest-growing  workforces  in the country, playing a vital role in job
creation and economic growth; serving in  roles  that  include:  nursing
assistants,  home  health  aides,  and personal care aides; they work in
hospitals,  nursing  facilities,  assisted  living  facilities,
community-based  residential  settings, non-residential day programs and
private homes; and
 
  WHEREAS, These essential  workers  carry  out  their  life-affirming
tasks  despite  low  wages;  about  53%  of direct caregivers use public
benefits such as Medicaid or food stamps; and
 
  WHEREAS, As team members of one of the  largest  industries  in  the
United  States,  the  dedicated  efforts  of  direct caregivers often go
unheralded in the media, and unnoticed by the general public; and
 
  WHEREAS, New Yorkers benefit  daily  from  the  caring  and  skilled
attention  of  these  individuals and it is appropriate to recognize the
innumerable contributions of direct caregivers by designating a  special
day in their honor; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  17,  2023,  as
Direct Caregivers Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
