  CONGRATULATING  the  Syosset  High  School Science
  Olympiad Team upon the occasion of winning  the  New
  York State Science Olympiad Competition
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to commend and pay
tribute  to  those  who,  by  achieving  outstanding  success  in  their
educational and scientific endeavors, have inspired and brought pride to
our majestic Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize
the  dedication  and  commitment  of  our  young  people who distinguish
themselves through excellence in science competition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
congratulate the Syosset High School  Science  Olympiad  Team  upon  the
occasion  of  winning  the  New York State Science Olympiad Competition,
which was held from March 17-18, 2023, at Le Moyne College in  Syracuse,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  team's  victory  is  the  first  time in Syosset High
School's history the team has ever placed first at the state level; with
this monumental win,  the  team  has  earned  a  spot  at  the  National
competition in Wichita, Kansas, this coming May; and
 
  WHEREAS, Earlier this year, 450 teams from around the state competed
in  regional  competitions  with  only the top 60 advancing to the state
level; having placed within the top 60, the Syosset High School  Science
Olympiad  Team  traveled  to  Le  Moyne  College where they completed 23
science-related events that ranged from building devices  to  conducting
lab experiments; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Syosset High School Science Olympiad Team's exceptional
final score was recorded as the second-best score in the 37 years of the
New York State competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Science Olympiad is a national non-profit organization
dedicated to improving the quality of Kindergarten-12 science education,
increasing male, female and minority interest  in  science,  creating  a
technologically-literate  workforce  and  providing  for recognition for
outstanding achievement by both students and teachers; these  goals  are
achieved  by  participating  in  Science  Olympiad  tournaments  and
non-competitive events, incorporating Science  Olympiad  into  classroom
curriculum and attending teacher training institutes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Math  (STEM)  is
becoming an exceedingly popular and driving field in New York's  economy
and  Science  Olympiad programs are influential in preparing students to
be leaders in  STEM  and  at  the  forefront  of  emerging  science  and
technology; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  appropriate  to  celebrate  the  educational  and
scientific accomplishments of remarkable schools  such  as  the  Syosset
 
Central  School  District,  and its students, coaches and teachers; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate the members of the Syosset  High  School  Science  Olympiad
Team:  Simeone Hur, Warren Zhao, Aarya Patel, Alex Chen, Andy Chen, Tina
Chen,  Blesson  Ren,  Brenton Lee, Anthony Rodriguez, Connor Jin, Darius
Fan, Ishan Patel, Jasmine Liu,  Jesse  Lebolt,  Marcus  Hoshino,  Samuel
Wang,  Samuel  Xiao,  Simone  Lim  and  Sophia Delgiannidis; and Advisor
Mildred Castaneda upon the  occasion  of  winning  the  New  York  State
Science Olympiad Competition; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of the Syosset High School  Science  Olympiad
Team and to Adviser Mildred Castaneda.
