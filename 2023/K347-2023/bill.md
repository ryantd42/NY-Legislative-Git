  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 23-29, 2023, as Crime Victims' Rights Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks set aside to increase awareness of serious  issues  which
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 23-29, 2023, as Crime Victims'
Rights Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Crime Victims' Rights Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, For the past three decades, Americans have joined  together
to  recognize the needs and rights of crime victims and survivors during
National Crime Victims' Rights Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every man, woman and child who is victimized  by  crime  in
America deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  22  million  Americans  are  directly harmed by crime each
year,  and  each  crime  affects  many  more  family  members,  friends,
neighbors, and co-workers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crime  can  leave  a  lasting  physical,  emotional,  and
financial impact on people  of  all  ages  and  abilities,  and  of  all
economic, racial, and social backgrounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1984,  the  Crime  Victims Fund was established by the
Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to provide a permanent source of support for
crime victim services and compensation through fines and penalties  paid
by convicted federal offenders; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, thousands of victim assistance programs provide help
and  support  to  child  victims  of violence and sexual abuse; stalking
victims;  survivors  of  homicide  victims;  victims  of  drunk-driving
crashes;  and victims of domestic, dating, and sexual violence and other
crimes; and
 
  WHEREAS, The victim assistance community  faces  new  challenges  to
reach  and serve all victims, including victims of new crimes like cyber
crime and terrorism and victims who have not always trusted the criminal
justice system, including immigrant victims, urban  youth,  and  victims
who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning; and
 
  WHEREAS, Important efforts have been implemented to ensure treatment
to  help  victims  begin healing; among the volunteers and professionals
who work toward this are law enforcement officers,  prosecutors,  victim
service  providers,  correction officers, parole and probation officers,
counselors, physicians, health care professionals, and the  many  others
whose  dedication  and  service  to crime victims help lessen trauma and
assist in personal recovery; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Crime  Victims'  Rights Week, April 23-29, 2023,
provides  an  opportunity  to  celebrate  the  energy,  creativity,  and
commitment  that  launched  the  victims'  rights movement, inspired its
progress, and continues to  advance  the  cause  of  justice  for  crime
victims; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Respect and dignity are basic rights of all those who have
been victimized by crime; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 23-29, 2023, as
Crime Victims' Rights Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
