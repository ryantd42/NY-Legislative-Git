 Introduced by M. of A. GALLAHAN -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to the required number of
  days  school is in session and providing schools the option to operate
  one hundred eighty days of instruction or  the  equivalent  number  of
  hours of pupil instruction

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares
 that  a  number of schools nationwide have implemented a flexible school
 week schedule while still maintaining the statutorily required amount of
 instructional time. This type of flexibility has resulted in savings  on
 such items as energy, transportation and substitute teacher costs, along
 with  better  attendance,  less time lost to extracurricular activities,
 more opportunities for teacher training  and  appointments,  and  longer
 class  periods  for  instructional  time. Many of the districts in other
 states which have already implemented flexible school schedules tend  to
 be  smaller  and  rural  with  long  transportation  routes  to and from
 schools, and with no other option to save  costs  other  than  to  close
 schools or layoff staff. Given the fiscal crisis facing New York as well
 as rising fuel, energy, and transportation costs, a flexible school week
 schedule  based  on  the equivalent hours of pupil instruction may offer
 schools operational  flexibility  without  jeopardizing  the  amount  of
 instructional time required by law.
  New  York  state  is  without legal authority to operate less than one
 hundred eighty days of instruction without  forfeiting  state  aid.  The
 lack  of  operational  flexibility  in  school  districts, in particular
 regard to instructional days, is a problem largely unaddressed in  state
 statute  or  regulation. A well-planned alternative school week schedule
 can be cost-effective, and can  provide  flexibility  for  those  school
 districts in fiscal crisis, while maintaining a quality education.

  Therefore, the legislature finds that enactment of this legislation is
 necessary  and  appropriate  to  make  certain that school boards, after
 thorough review and public comment, have the discretion and authority to
 provide local school districts with operational  flexibility  to  modify
 the number of instructional days per year, while maintaining the quality
 of  education  at the particular school or schools requesting a flexible
 school week schedule.
  § 2. Section 551 of the education law, as added by chapter 414 of  the
 laws of 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  § 551. Apportionment.  1.  In order to meet proper health, welfare and
 safety standards in qualifying schools for the  benefit  of  the  pupils
 enrolled  therein, there shall be apportioned health, welfare and safety
 grants by the commissioner to each  qualifying  school  for  the  school
 years  beginning  on and after July first, nineteen hundred seventy-one,
 an amount equal to the product of thirty dollars multiplied by the aver-
 age daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance of pupils  receiving  instruc-
 tion  in such school, to be applied for costs of maintenance and repair.
 Such apportionment shall be increased by ten dollars multiplied  by  the
 average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  attendance  of  pupils receiving
 instruction in a school building constructed prior to  nineteen  hundred
 forty-seven.  In  no event shall the per pupil annual allowance computed
 under this section exceed fifty per centum of the average per pupil cost
 of equivalent maintenance and repair in the public schools of the  state
 on  a  state-wide  basis,  as  determined by the commissioner, and in no
 event shall the apportionment to a qualifying school exceed  the  amount
 of  expenditures  for  maintenance and repair of such school as reported
 pursuant to section five hundred fifty-two of this article.
  2. The apportionment pursuant to this section shall be reduced by  one
 one  hundred  eightieth  for  each day less than one hundred eighty days
 that such school was actually in total session in the base  year,  OR  A
 SCHOOL  FAILING  TO  COMPLY WITH THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL
 INSTRUCTION SHALL FORFEIT FROM ITS APPORTIONMENT AN AMOUNT DETERMINED BY
 APPLYING A RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS THE SCHOOL WAS IN  NONCOMPLIANCE
 IN  RELATION TO THE REQUIRED MINIMUM EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL
 INSTRUCTION, except that the commissioner may disregard  such  reduction
 up  to  five days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS if he finds that the
 school was not in session for one hundred eighty days OR THE  EQUIVALENT
 NUMBER  OF  HOURS  OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION because of extraordinary adverse
 weather conditions, impairment of heating facilities,  insufficiency  of
 water  supply, shortage of fuel or the destruction of a school building,
 and if the commissioner further finds that such school  cannot  make  up
 such  days  OR  THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS of instruction during the
 school year. No such reduction shall be made, however, for  any  day  on
 which  such  school  was in session for the purpose of administering the
 regents examinations or the regents  scholarship  examinations,  or  any
 day,  not  to  exceed three days, OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS when
 such school was not in session  because  of  a  conference  of  teachers
 called by the principal of the school.
  § 3. Subdivision 2 of section 1704 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 543 of the laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law, no board of education or
 community board in the city school district of  the  city  of  New  York
 shall  provide  for  a  school year consisting of fewer than one hundred
 eighty days of school  OR  THE  EQUIVALENT  NUMBER  OF  HOURS  OF  PUPIL
 INSTRUCTION.
 A. 2986  3
 
  § 4. Paragraphs a and c of subdivision 2 of section 2117 of the educa-
 tion  law,  as  added by chapter 744 of the laws of 1952, are amended to
 read as follows:
  a.  The whole time school has been maintained in their district during
 the year ending on June thirtieth previous to the date of  such  report,
 and  stating  what  portion  of  the time such school has been taught by
 qualified teachers, and the whole number  of  days,  OR  THE  EQUIVALENT
 NUMBER  OF  HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION, including holidays, in which the
 school was taught by qualified teachers.
  c. The number of children taught in the district during such  year  by
 qualified teachers, and the aggregate days' OR EQUIVALENT HOURS' attend-
 ance of all such children.
  § 5. The first undesignated paragraph of section 3107 of the education
 law,  as  amended by chapter 784 of the laws of 1961, is amended to read
 as follows:
  In cities having a population of one million or more, employees of the
 board of education who are  members  of  the  New  York  city  teachers'
 retirement  system  shall be granted sick leave due to personal illness.
 Such sick leave shall be on the basis of at least ten days for each year
 of service, cumulative to a maximum of two hundred days.  Members  shall
 upon  application be granted a retirement leave of absence with full pay
 consisting of one-half of their accumulated unused sick leave, up  to  a
 maximum  of  one  school term or the equivalent number of school days OR
 THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION.
  § 6. Paragraph a of subdivision 4 of section  3204  of  the  education
 law,  as  amended  by  section  7 of part A of chapter 56 of the laws of
 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  a. A full time day school or class, except  as  otherwise  prescribed,
 shall be in session for not less than one hundred eighty days each year,
 OR  THE  EQUIVALENT  NUMBER  OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION, exclusive of
 legal holidays that occur during the term of said school  and  exclusive
 of Saturdays.
  §  7.  Paragraphs  d,  k and l of subdivision 1 of section 3602 of the
 education law, as amended by section 11 of part B of chapter 57  of  the
 laws of 2007, are amended to read as follows:
  d.  "Average  daily attendance" shall mean the total number of attend-
 ance days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF  HOURS  OF  PUPIL  INSTRUCTION  of
 pupils  in  a public school of a school district in kindergarten through
 grade twelve, or equivalent ungraded programs, plus the total number  of
 instruction  days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION
 for such pupils receiving homebound instruction including pupils receiv-
 ing  instruction  through  a  two-way  telephone  communication  system,
 divided  by  the  number of days OR EQUIVALENT HOURS the district school
 was in session as provided in this section.  The  attendance  of  pupils
 with  disabilities  attending  under  the  provisions  of paragraph c of
 subdivision two of section forty-four hundred one of this chapter  shall
 be added to average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance.
  (1)  Equivalent attendance shall mean the quotient of the total number
 of student hours of instruction in programs in  a  public  school  of  a
 school  district  or a board of cooperative educational services leading
 to a high school diploma or a high school equivalency diploma as defined
 in regulations of the commissioner for pupils under the age  of  twenty-
 one not on a regular day school register of the district, divided by one
 thousand.  Average  daily  OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance shall include
 the equivalent attendance of the school district. For  the  purposes  of
 secondary  school weighting, such equivalent attendance shall be consid-
 A. 2986  4
 
 ered as average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance  in  grades  seven
 through twelve.
  (2) In computing average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance, school
 districts  may, with the commissioner's approval, exclude attendance for
 those days OR EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION, on  which
 school  attendance  was  adversely  affected  because  of an epidemic or
 manmade or natural disaster or  act  of  terrorism.  In  computing  such
 attendance, the school district shall: (i) determine the number of reli-
 gious  holidays  which fall on a school day IN WHICH SCHOOL IS SCHEDULED
 TO BE IN SESSION within a school year according  to  regulations  estab-
 lished  by  the  commissioner, such religious holidays to be duly recog-
 nized as such for purposes of this section by duly adopted resolution of
 the board of education; (ii) deduct the  aggregate  attendance  on  such
 religious  holidays from the total aggregate attendance, by grade level;
 (iii) deduct such religious holidays from the total number  of  days  OR
 EQUIVALENT  NUMBER  OF  HOURS  OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION of session, by grade
 level; and (iv) compute the average daily OR EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  attend-
 ance for the school year.
  k.  "Attendance ratio" shall mean the number computed to four decimals
 without rounding when the aggregate days OR EQUIVALENT HOURS  attendance
 is divided by the possible aggregate attendance of all pupils in attend-
 ance  in  the  district,  as  computed  for  each school district by the
 commissioner by June first of the year following the attendance year.
  l. "Average  daily  membership"  shall  mean  the  possible  aggregate
 attendance  of all pupils in attendance in a public school of the school
 district in kindergarten through grade twelve,  or  equivalent  ungraded
 programs,  including  possible  aggregate  attendance  for  such  pupils
 receiving homebound instruction, including pupils receiving  instruction
 through  a  two-way  telephone  communication  system, with the possible
 aggregate attendance of such pupils in one-half day kindergartens multi-
 plied by one-half, divided by the number of days OR EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF
 HOURS OF PUPIL  INSTRUCTION  the  district  school  was  in  session  as
 provided  in this section. The full time equivalent enrollment of pupils
 with disabilities attending under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  c  of
 subdivision  two of section forty-four hundred one of this chapter shall
 be added to average daily OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  membership.  Average
 daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  membership  shall  include the equivalent
 attendance of the school district, as computed pursuant to  paragraph  d
 of  this  subdivision.  In  any  instance where a pupil is a resident of
 another state or an Indian pupil is a  resident  of  any  portion  of  a
 reservation  located  wholly  or  partly within the borders of the state
 pursuant to subdivision four of section forty-one hundred  one  of  this
 chapter  or  a pupil is living on federally owned land or property, such
 pupil's possible aggregate attendance shall be counted as  part  of  the
 possible aggregate attendance of the school district in which such pupil
 is enrolled.
  § 8. Paragraphs a and b of subdivision 2 of section 3602 of the educa-
 tion  law,  as amended by section 13 of part B of chapter 57 of the laws
 of 2007, are amended to read as follows:
  a. Computation of resident weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY
 attendance. For purposes of  this  section  weighted  average  daily  OR
 EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  attendance  of a school district for any school year
 shall be computed as follows:
  (1) Weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY  attendance  shall  be
 determined by using the average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance of
 public  school  pupils in a full-day kindergarten and grades one through
 A. 2986  5
 
 six as the basic unit, with the attendance of such  pupils  in  one-half
 day  kindergartens  measured  at  one-half  of  such  basic unit and the
 attendance of such pupils in grades seven through twelve measured at one
 and  one-quarter  of  such  basic  unit.  The sum of all such units of
 attendance shall be the weighted  average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY
 attendance.
  (2) In computing such attendance, the school district shall (i) deter-
 mine  the  number  of  religious  holidays which fall on a school day IN
 WHICH SCHOOL IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN SESSION within a school year  accord-
 ing to regulations established by the commissioner, such religious holi-
 days  to be duly recognized as such for purposes of this section by duly
 adopted resolution of the board of education; (ii) deduct the  aggregate
 attendance  on  such religious holidays from the total aggregate attend-
 ance, by grade level; (iii) deduct  such  religious  holidays  from  the
 total  number of days OR EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS of session, by grade
 level; (iv) compute the weighted  average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY
 attendance for the school year.
  (3) In any instance where a pupil is a resident of another state or an
 Indian pupil is a resident of any portion of a reservation located whol-
 ly  or  partly  within  the borders of the state pursuant to subdivision
 four of section forty-one hundred one of this  chapter  or  a  pupil  is
 living  on  federally  owned  land  or property, such pupil's attendance
 shall be counted as part of the weighted  average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT
 HOURLY  attendance  of  the  school  district  in  which  such  pupil is
 enrolled.
  (4) Resident weighted average daily OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  attendance
 for  purposes  of determining the aid ratio of a school district for any
 school year shall be the weighted average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY
 attendance for the school year immediately preceding the base year, less
 the  weighted  average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance of nonresi-
 dent pupils attending public schools in the  district  for  such  school
 year, plus the weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance of
 pupils  resident in the district but attending public schools in another
 district or state plus the weighted average daily OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY
 attendance  of pupils resident in the district but attending full-time a
 school operated by a board of  cooperative  educational  services  or  a
 county  vocational  education  and extension board for such school year.
 The attendance of nonresident pupils  attending  public  school  in  the
 district  and  resident  pupils  attending  such  schools outside of the
 district shall be determined by applying to the number  of  such  pupils
 registered  during  the  school year in each case the ratio of aggregate
 days OR EQUIVALENT HOURS attendance to the possible  aggregate  days  OR
 EQUIVALENT HOURS attendance of all pupils in attendance in the district.
 Indian pupils of a reservation attending public school, or pupils living
 on the United States military reservation at West Point attending public
 school,  shall be deemed to be resident pupils of the district providing
 such school, for purposes of this paragraph. Where a school district has
 entered into a contract with the state university pursuant  to  subdivi-
 sion two of section three hundred fifty-five of this chapter under which
 the  school  district  makes  payments  in the nature of tuition for the
 education of certain children residing in the  district,  such  children
 for  whom  such tuition payments are made shall be deemed to be resident
 pupils of such district for the purposes of this paragraph.
  (5) In determining the resident weighted average daily  OR  EQUIVALENT
 HOURLY  attendance  of  a  component  school  district of a central high
 school district for computing the aid ratio the weighted  average  daily
 A. 2986  6
 
 OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY attendance of high school pupils residing in such
 component district and  attending  the  central  high  school  shall  be
 included.  The  resident  weighted  average  daily  OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY
 attendance  of a central high school district itself shall be the sum of
 the resident weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY  attendance  of
 each  component  school  district  computed  as  provided  in  the first
 sentence of this paragraph.
  (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs four and  five  of
 this  paragraph,  when a school district shall experience an increase in
 resident weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY  attendance  during
 the  current year because of the closing in whole, or in part, of a non-
 public school or a campus school, or a school previously operated by the
 United States government on the United States  military  reservation  at
 West  Point,  the  commissioner,  in  computing  any  aid  ratio of such
 district, shall permit the use  of  such  additional  resident  weighted
 average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY attendance for aid ratio purposes
 during the current year and the next succeeding year, provided that such
 additional resident weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY  attend-
 ance  attributable  to such closing, or part thereof, shall be in excess
 of one hundred students; provided, however,  that  such  district  which
 qualifies  for an increase in total wealth pupil units pursuant to para-
 graph f of this subdivision, shall use the increase in resident weighted
 average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance, even if such increase  in
 resident  weighted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance is less
 than one hundred.
  b. Computation of adjusted average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY  attend-
 ance.  For purposes of this section adjusted average daily OR EQUIVALENT
 HOURLY attendance of a school district for  any  school  year  shall  be
 computed as follows:
  (1)  Adjusted  average  daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance shall be
 determined by using the average daily OR EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance of
 public school pupils in a full-day kindergarten and grades  one  through
 twelve as the basic unit, with the attendance of such pupils in one-half
 day  kindergartens  measured  at one-half of such basic unit. The sum of
 all such units of attendance shall be  the  adjusted  average  daily  OR
 EQUIVALENT HOURLY attendance.
  (2) In computing such attendance, the school district shall (i) deter-
 mine  the  number  of  religious  holidays which fall on a school day IN
 WHICH SCHOOL IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN SESSION within a school year  accord-
 ing to regulations established by the commissioner, such religious holi-
 days  to be duly recognized as such for purposes of this section by duly
 adopted resolution of the board of education; (ii) deduct the  aggregate
 attendance  on  such religious holidays from the total aggregate attend-
 ance, by grade level; (iii) deduct  such  religious  holidays  from  the
 total  number of days OR EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS of session, by grade
 level; (iv) compute the adjusted  average  daily  OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY
 attendance for the school year.
  (3) In any instance where a pupil is a resident of another state or an
 Indian pupil is a resident of any portion of a reservation located whol-
 ly  or  partly  within  the borders of the state pursuant to subdivision
 four of section forty-one hundred one of this  chapter  or  a  pupil  is
 living  on  federally  owned  land  or property, such pupil's attendance
 shall be counted as part of the adjusted average daily attendance of the
 school district in which such pupil is enrolled.
 A. 2986  7
 
  § 9. Paragraph e of subdivision 1 of section 3602-c of  the  education
 law,  as  amended by chapter 740 of the laws of 1982, is amended to read
 as follows:
  e.  "Average  daily attendance" shall mean the total number of attend-
 ance days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS of pupils receiving services
 divided by the number of days OR EQUIVALENT HOURS the public school  was
 in  session  for each attendance period. For each such attendance period
 the total number of attendance days OR EQUIVALENT NUMBER  OF  HOURS  for
 each such pupil shall be determined by multiplying the number of days OR
 EQUIVALENT HOURS on which each such pupil was in attendance by the ratio
 obtained  by  dividing the number of class periods of each such pupil by
 the total number of class periods, not to exceed five, operated  by  the
 public  school during the school day. Only pupils residing in this state
 shall be included in such computation.
  § 10.  Paragraph m of subdivision 12 and  subdivision  16  of  section
 3602-e of the education law, paragraph m of subdivision 12 as amended by
 section  19  of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007 and subdivision
 16 as amended by section 18 of part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2013,
 are amended to read as follows:
  m. a process for the  waiver  of  the  time  requirements  established
 pursuant  to  this  subdivision in order to authorize the operation of a
 summer universal prekindergarten program limited to the months  of  July
 and  August, upon a finding by the commissioner that the school district
 is unable to operate the  program  during  the  regular  school  session
 because  of  a  lack  of  available space pursuant to regulations of the
 commissioner. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the
 contrary, such process shall provide for a  reduction  of  the  aid  per
 prekindergarten  pupil payable for pupils served pursuant to such waiver
 by one one-hundred eightieth of the aid per prekindergarten pupil deter-
 mined pursuant to paragraph a of subdivision ten [or subparagraph (i) of
 paragraph b of subdivision ten-a] of this section for each day OR EQUIV-
 ALENT HOUR less than one hundred eighty days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF
 HOURS that the summer program is in session.
  16. The grant payable to a school district pursuant to this section in
 the current year shall be reduced by one one-hundred eightieth for  each
 day less than one hundred eighty days that the universal prekindergarten
 classes  of the district were actually in session, OR A DISTRICT FAILING
 TO COMPLY WITH THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION SHALL
 FORFEIT FROM ITS TOTAL STATE AID  ALLOCATION  AN  AMOUNT  DETERMINED  BY
 APPLYING  A  RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS THE DISTRICT WAS IN NONCOMPLI-
 ANCE IN RELATION TO THE REQUIRED MINIMUM EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF  HOURS  OF
 PUPIL  INSTRUCTION,  except  that  the  commissioner  may disregard such
 reduction for any deficiency that may be disregarded in computing  total
 foundation  aid  pursuant to subdivision seven or eight of section thir-
 ty-six hundred four of this [chapter] PART and in addition may disregard
 a reduction for any deficiency that is caused by a delay in the  opening
 of  public  school classes due to extraordinarily adverse weather condi-
 tions or other cause cited in such subdivision seven of section  thirty-
 six  hundred  four  that  results in cancellation of the prekindergarten
 program or of transportation to such program.
  § 11. Subdivisions 7 and 8 of  section  3604  of  the  education  law,
 subdivision 7 as amended by chapter 107 of the laws of 2020 and subdivi-
 sion  8  as  amended by chapter 605 of the laws of 2019, are amended and
 five new subdivisions 7-c, 7-d, 7-e, 7-f and 7-g are added  to  read  as
 follows:
 A. 2986  8
 
  7.  No district shall be entitled to any portion of such school moneys
 on such apportionment unless the report of  the  trustees  or  board  of
 education  for  the  preceding  school  year  shall show that the public
 schools were actually in session in the district and taught by a  quali-
 fied  teacher or by successive qualified teachers or by qualified teach-
 ers for not less than one hundred eighty days OR THE  EQUIVALENT  NUMBER
 OF  HOURS  OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION. The moneys payable to a school district
 pursuant to section thirty-six  hundred  nine-a  of  this  part  in  the
 current  year  shall  be  reduced  by  one  one-hundred eightieth of the
 district's total foundation aid for the base year for each day less than
 one hundred eighty days that the schools of the district  were  actually
 in session OR A DISTRICT FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF
 HOURS  OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION SHALL FORFEIT FROM ITS TOTAL STATE AID ALLO-
 CATION AN AMOUNT DETERMINED BY APPLYING A RATIO OF THE NUMBER  OF  HOURS
 THE  DISTRICT  WAS  IN NONCOMPLIANCE IN RELATION TO THE REQUIRED MINIMUM
 EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION, except that the commis-
 sioner may disregard such  reduction  in  the  apportionment  of  public
 money:  (i)  for  any  day  or days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS on
 which session had been previously scheduled but the  superintendent  was
 required  to  close  the  school  or  schools due to a properly executed
 declaration of a state or local state of emergency pursuant  to  article
 two-B  of  the executive law; or (ii) for up to five days, OR THE EQUIV-
 ALENT NUMBER OF HOURS if he  or  she  finds  that  the  schools  of  the
 district  were  not in session for one hundred eighty days OR THE EQUIV-
 ALENT NUMBER OF HOURS because of extraordinarily adverse weather  condi-
 tions,  impairment of heating facilities, insufficiency of water supply,
 shortage of fuel, lack of electricity, natural gas leakage, unacceptable
 levels of chemical substances, a credible threat to  student  safety  as
 reasonably  determined by a lead school official or the destruction of a
 school building either in whole or in part, and if, further, the commis-
 sioner finds that such district cannot make up such days  OR  EQUIVALENT
 HOURS  of  instruction  by  using for the secondary grades all scheduled
 vacation days which occur prior to the first scheduled regents  examina-
 tion  day  in June, and for the elementary grades all scheduled vacation
 days which occur prior to the last scheduled regents examination day  in
 June;  or  (iii) for any day or days in the two thousand nineteen -- two
 thousand twenty school year on which session had been previously  sched-
 uled  but  the chancellor of the city school district of the city of New
 York or the superintendent of a district closed the  school  or  schools
 due  to  a determination by the chancellor or superintendent that it was
 in the best interest of public health or safety of the  school  district
 to  close  the  school  or schools in response to the novel coronavirus,
 COVID-19. For the purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "scheduled  vacation
 days"  shall  mean  days on which the schools of the district are not in
 session and for which no prohibition exists in subdivision eight of this
 section for them to be in session.
  7-C. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS" MEANS
 ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF INSTRUCTION OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS
 OF PUPIL INSTRUCTION PER SCHOOL YEAR BASED ON A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF DAYS
 OF INSTRUCTION APPROVED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD OR  CHAR-
 TER SCHOOL GOVERNING BODY.
  7-D.  THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD, IN ITS DISCRETION, MAY AUTHORIZE SOME OR
 ALL OF ITS SCHOOLS TO MODIFY THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS  PER  YEAR
 AFTER  THOROUGH  REVIEW  AND PUBLIC COMMENT.  BEFORE AUTHORIZING SOME OR
 ALL OF ITS SCHOOLS TO MODIFY THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS PER  YEAR,
 A. 2986  9
 
 THE  SCHOOL  BOARD, SHALL WITHIN ITS REVIEW, INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED
 TO, CONSIDERATION OF THE FOLLOWING:
  A. HOW THE SCHOOL OR SCHOOLS WILL MAINTAIN A QUALITY EDUCATION;
  B. THE REASON FOR THE REQUEST;
  C. THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT TO PUPILS;
  D.  WAYS  TO NEGOTIATE THE CHANGES WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT
 REPRESENTING THE EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES;
  E. INPUT FROM EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES BUT NOT REPRESENTED BY
 A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT;
  F. THE IMPACT OF AN ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL WEEK SCHEDULE ON PRIMARY  GRADE
 PUPILS; AND
  G.  THE  IMPACT  OF  AN  ALTERNATIVE  SCHOOL  WEEK SCHEDULE ON WORKING

  7-E. AFTER REVIEW, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE CONSIDERATIONS SET FORTH  IN
 SUBDIVISION  SEVEN-D  OF  THIS  SECTION, A SCHOOL BOARD SHALL CONDUCT AT
 LEAST ONE PUBLIC HEARING, TO GATHER PUBLIC  INPUT,  AND  TO  PROVIDE  AT
 LEAST  THIRTY  DAYS  NOTICE  TO  THE PUBLIC PRIOR TO SUCH HEARING.  THE
 SCHOOL BOARD MAY AUTHORIZE SOME OR ALL OF  ITS  SCHOOLS  TO  MODIFY  THE
 NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS PER YEAR PROVIDED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS
 OF  INSTRUCTION  PER YEAR IS NO LESS THAN THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF INSTRUC-
 TIONAL HOURS PER YEAR ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSIONER'S REGULATIONS  FOR
 THAT  PARTICULAR  GROUP  OF  PUPILS.  SUBJECT TO A POLICY DEVELOPED AND

 LATIONS, SHALL FORFEIT FROM ITS TOTAL STATE  AID  ALLOCATION  AN  AMOUNT
 DETERMINED  BY  APPLYING A RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS THE DISTRICT WAS
 IN NONCOMPLIANCE IN RELATION TO THE REQUIRED MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS  AS
 ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSIONER.  NOT LATER THAN AUGUST FIRST, THE BOARD
 OF  EACH DISTRICT SHALL CERTIFY TO THE DEPARTMENT THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF
 PUPIL INSTRUCTION IN THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL YEAR. IF THE DISTRICT  DID  NOT
 PROVIDE  AT LEAST THE REQUIRED MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS OF PUPIL INSTRUC-
 TION AS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSIONER,  THE  DEDUCTION  OF  STATE  AID
 SHALL  BE  MADE  IN  THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR FROM THE FIRST PAYMENT OF

  8.  No  school  shall  be in session on a Saturday or a legal holiday,
 except general election day, Washington's birthday and Lincoln's  birth-
 day,  and  except  that  driver  education classes may be conducted on a
 Saturday. A deficiency not exceeding four days OR THE EQUIVALENT  NUMBER
 OF  HOURS  during  any  school  year caused by teachers' attendance upon
 conferences held by superintendents of schools of city school  districts
 or  other school districts employing superintendents of schools shall be
 excused by the commissioner, notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule
 or  regulation  to the contrary, a school district may elect to schedule
 such conference days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS in the  last  two
 weeks  of August, subject to collective bargaining requirements pursuant
 to article fourteen of the civil service  law,  and  such  days  OR  THE
 EQUIVALENT  NUMBER  OF  HOURS  shall be counted towards the required one
 hundred eighty days of session, provided however, that  such  scheduling
 shall  not alter the obligation of the school district to provide trans-
 portation to students in non-public elementary and secondary schools  or
 charter  schools.  At  least  two such conference days OR THE EQUIVALENT
 A. 2986  10
 
 NUMBER OF HOURS during such school year  shall  be  dedicated  to  staff
 attendance  upon  conferences  providing  staff  development relating to
 implementation of the new high learning standards  and  assessments,  as
 adopted by the board of regents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
 law,  rule  or regulation to the contrary, school districts may elect to
 use one or more of such allowable  conference  days  OR  THE  EQUIVALENT
 NUMBER OF HOURS in units of not less than one hour each to provide staff
 development activities relating to implementation of the new high learn-
 ing  standards  and  assessments.  A  district  making such election may
 provide such staff development on any  day  during  which  sessions  are
 allowed  and  apply  such units to satisfy a deficiency in the length of
 one or more daily OR  EQUIVALENT  HOURLY  sessions  of  instruction  for
 pupils as specified in regulations of the commissioner. The commissioner
 shall assure that such conference days OR THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HOURS
 include  appropriate  school violence prevention and intervention train-
 ing, and may require that up to one such conference day  OR  THE  EQUIV-
 ALENT NUMBER OF HOURS be dedicated for such purpose.

 portation has been requested not later than the first  day  of  June  in
 each  year, of the days on which the public schools [will] ARE SCHEDULED

 which  provides  transportation  to nonpublic schools shall provide such
 transportation for the same number of days as  the  public  schools  are

 duled to be closed, except that in any year in which the first  or  last
