  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Clauses 21 and 22 of paragraph (a) of section 1607 of the
 not-for-profit corporation law, as amended by chapter 338 of the laws of
 2016, are amended to read as follows:

 bank has the power to pursue under this article when the primary  reason
 for which the subsidiary shall be organized shall be to limit the poten-

 land bank or because state or federal law requires that the purpose of a
 subsidiary be undertaken through a specific corporate or business struc-

 shall  be  maintained on the inventory lists required in this article of
 the land bank of which it is a subsidiary and the subsidiary shall  make
 all  reports  and  other disclosures as are required of land banks under
 this article and as local public authorities,  unless  the  subsidiary's
 operations  and finances are consolidated with those of the land bank of
 which it is a subsidiary.  Subsidiaries  organized  under  this  article
 shall be established in the form of a New York charitable not-for-profit
 corporation  or  a  New  York  single  member limited liability company.
 Subsidiaries shall not have the authority to issue bonds, notes or other
 debts, provided, however, that such  subsidiaries  may  issue  notes  or
 other  debt  to the land bank of which it is a subsidiary. The organiza-
 tional documents filed to create a subsidiary under this  article  shall

 its  income  and operations are exempt from all taxation by the state of
 New York and by any of its political subdivisions; [and]
  (22) TO LEND MONEY, TO MAKE GRANTS AND TAKE AND HOLD REAL AND PERSONAL
 PROPERTY  AS  SECURITY  FOR  THE  PAYMENT  OF FUNDS SO LOANED OR FOR THE
 PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF GRANT AGREEMENTS; AND
  (23) to do all other things necessary to achieve  the  objectives  and
 purposes  of the land bank or other laws that relate to the purposes and
 responsibility of the land bank.
