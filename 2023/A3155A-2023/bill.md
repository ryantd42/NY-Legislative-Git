  § 4. Section 3213 of the civil practice law and rules, as  amended  by
 chapter 593 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  §  3213.  Motion  for  summary  judgment in lieu of complaint. When an
 action is based upon an instrument for the payment of money only or upon
 any judgment, the plaintiff may serve  with  the  summons  a  notice  of
 motion  for  summary  judgment  and  the  supporting papers in lieu of a
 complaint. The summons served with such motion papers shall require  the
 defendant  to  submit  answering  papers  on  the motion within the time
 provided in the notice of motion. The minimum time such motion shall  be
 noticed  to be heard shall be as provided by subdivision (a) of rule 320
 for making an appearance, depending upon the method of service.  If  the
 A. 3155  10
 
 plaintiff  sets  the  hearing  date of the motion later than the minimum
 time therefor, he may require the defendant  to  serve  a  copy  of  his
 answering  papers  upon  him  within  such  extended period of time, not
 exceeding  ten days, prior to such hearing date. No default judgment may
 be entered pursuant to subdivision (a) of  section  3215  prior  to  the
 hearing  date  of  the  motion.  If the motion is denied, the moving and
 answering papers shall be deemed the complaint and answer, respectively,
 unless the court orders otherwise. The  additional  notice  required  by
 subdivision (j) of rule 3212 shall be applicable to a motion made pursu-
 ant  to  this  section  in any action to collect a debt arising out of a
 consumer credit transaction where a consumer is a defendant.  THE  ADDI-
 TIONAL  PLEADING  REQUIRED  BY  SECTION  3012-C SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO A
 MOTION MADE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION IN ANY ACTION  TO  COLLECT  A  DEBT
 ARISING  OUT  OF  A PRIVATE EDUCATION LOAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION ELEVEN
 HUNDRED OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW.
  § 5. Severability. If any clause,  sentence,  paragraph,  subdivision,
 section  or part of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent
 jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,  impair,  or
 invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation
 to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or part thereof
 directly  involved  in the controversy in which such judgment shall have
 been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the legislature
 that this act would have been enacted even if  such  invalid  provisions
 had not been included herein.
  §  6.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
