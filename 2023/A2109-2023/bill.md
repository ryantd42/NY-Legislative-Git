 ble that further expenses may be incurred as a result of the injury. For
 the  purpose  of  determining basic economic loss, the expenses incurred
 under this paragraph shall be in  accordance  with  the  limitations  of
 section  five thousand one hundred eight of this article  MEDICAL TREAT-
 MENTS, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY  THE  POLICY  SHALL  BE

 SUSTAINED  IN  AUTOMOBILE  ACCIDENTS,  BUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARD

 NOSTIC TESTS OR OTHER SERVICES OR FOR THE PURCHASE  OF  DURABLE  MEDICAL

 ards for such policies and for self-insurers, and rights of subrogation,

 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-
 THREE  THAT AMENDED THIS SUBSECTION AND ESTABLISHED THE NEW YORK AUTOMO-

 A. 2109  5

 CLAIMS MAY BE MADE, BUT WHICH PERMIT THE FILING OF SUCH  INITIAL  NOTICE

 AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF SUCH THIRTY DAY PERIOD WHERE THE NATURE  OF  THE
 INJURY  RESULTS  IN A REASONABLY JUSTIFIABLE DELAY IN FILING THE INITIAL
 NOTICE DURING SUCH THIRTY DAY PERIOD.
  § 5. Section 5108 of the insurance law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subsection (d) to read as follows:
  (D)  PROOF  OF  THE  FACT  AND  COST OF A MEDICAL OR HEALTH SERVICE OR

 SERVICES PROVIDER TO  THE  COVERED  PERSON  SHALL  BE  SUBMITTED  WITHIN
 FORTY-FIVE  DAYS  FROM  THE DATE THE SERVICE WAS RENDERED TO THE COVERED

 TIME LIMIT MAY BE WAIVED AND THE CLAIMS OF ONE OR MORE SUCH  MEDICAL  OR
 HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE BUNDLED.
  §  6.  Section 5106 of the insurance law, subsection (b) as amended by
 chapter 452 of the laws of 2005, subsection (d) as amended by section  8
 of  part  AAA  of  chapter  59  of  the  laws of 2017 and paragraph 2 of
 subsection (d) as amended by chapter 129 of the laws of 2022, is amended
 to read as follows:
  § 5106. Fair claims settlement. (a) Payments of first  party  benefits
 and  additional  first  party  benefits  shall  be  made  as the loss is
 incurred. Such benefits are overdue if not paid within  [thirty]  FORTY-
 FIVE  days  after  the claimant supplies proof of the fact and amount of
 loss sustained. If proof is not supplied as to  the  entire  claim,  the
 amount  which is supported by proof is overdue if not paid within [thir-
 ty] FORTY-FIVE days after such proof is supplied. All  overdue  payments
 shall  bear  interest  at  the rate of two percent per month. If a valid
 claim or portion was overdue, the claimant shall  also  be  entitled  to
 recover  his  attorney's  reasonable  fee,  for  services  necessarily
 performed in connection with securing  payment  of  the  overdue  claim,
 subject to limitations promulgated by the superintendent in regulations.
 THE FAILURE TO ISSUE A DENIAL OF A CLAIM WITHIN THE FORTY-FIVE DAY PERI-
 OD  PROVIDED  FOR IN THIS SUBSECTION SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE INSURER FROM
 RAISING A DEFENSE TO THE CLAIM WHERE THE INSURER HAS MADE  A  REPORT  TO
 THE  INSURANCE  FRAUDS  BUREAU  PURSUANT TO SECTION FOUR HUNDRED FIVE OF
 THIS CHAPTER. AN INSURER WILL ALSO NOT BE  PRECLUDED  FROM  ESTABLISHING
 THAT THE CLAIMANT HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMA FACIE BURDEN OF PROOF.
  (b)  Every  insurer shall [provide] NOTIFY a claimant [with the option
 of submitting] THAT any dispute involving the insurer's liability to pay
 first party benefits, or additional first  party  benefits,  the  amount
 thereof  or  any other matter which may arise pursuant to subsection (a)
 of this section [to] MUST BE SETTLED BY arbitration pursuant to  simpli-
 fied  procedures  to  be  promulgated or approved by the superintendent.
 Such simplified procedures shall include an expedited eligibility  hear-
 ing  option,  when  required,  to  designate the insurer for first party
 benefits pursuant to subsection  (d)  of  this  section.  The  expedited
 eligibility  hearing  option  shall  be a forum for eligibility disputes
 only, and shall not include  the  submission  of  any  particular  bill,
 payment or claim for any specific benefit for adjudication, nor shall it
 consider any other defense to payment.
 A. 2109  6
 
  (c) An award by an arbitrator shall be binding except where vacated or
 modified by a master arbitrator in accordance with simplified procedures
 to  be  promulgated  or  approved by the superintendent. The grounds for
 vacating or modifying an arbitrator's award by a master arbitrator shall
 not  be  limited to those grounds for review set forth in article seven-
 ty-five of the civil practice law and rules. The award of a master arbi-
 trator shall be binding except for the grounds for review set  forth  in
 article  seventy-five of the civil practice law and rules[, and provided
 further that where the amount of such master arbitrator's award is  five
 thousand  dollars or greater, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees,
 the insurer or the claimant may institute a court action  to  adjudicate
 the dispute de novo].
  (d)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph two of this subsection, where
 there is reasonable belief more than one insurer would be the source  of
 first  party benefits, the insurers may agree among themselves, if there
 is a valid basis therefor, that one of them  will  accept  and  pay  the
 claim  initially.  If there is no such agreement, then the first insurer
 to whom notice of claim is given shall be responsible for  payment.  Any
 such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration proce-
 dures  established pursuant to section five thousand one hundred five of
 this article and regulations as promulgated by the  superintendent,  and
 any  insurer  paying  first-party  benefits shall be reimbursed by other
 insurers for their proportionate share of the costs of the claim and the
 allocated expenses of processing  the  claim,  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  entitled  "other  coverage"  contained in regulation and the
 provisions entitled "other sources of first-party benefits" contained in
 regulation. If there is no such insurer and the motor  vehicle  accident
 occurs  in  this  state,  then an applicant who is a qualified person as
 defined in article fifty-two of this chapter shall institute  the  claim
 against the motor vehicle accident indemnification corporation.
  (2)  A  group  policy  issued  pursuant to section three thousand four
 hundred fifty-five or three thousand four hundred  fifty-eight  of  this
 chapter  shall  provide first party benefits when a dispute exists as to
 whether a driver was using or operating a motor  vehicle  in  connection
 with  a  transportation  network  company  or  peer-to-peer  car sharing
 program when loss, damage, injury, or  death  occurs.  A  transportation
 network  company or peer-to-peer car sharing program administrator shall
 notify the insurer that issued the owner's policy of liability insurance
 of the dispute within ten business  days  of  becoming  aware  that  the
 dispute  exists.  When  there is a dispute, the group insurer liable for
 the payment of first party benefits under a group policy shall have  the
 right  to  recover  the  amount paid from the driver's insurer or in the
 case of a peer-to-peer car sharing program, the shared  vehicle  owner's
 insurer  to  the  extent  that  the driver would have been liable to pay
 damages in an action at law.
  § 7. Subsection (c) of section 5303 of the insurance law is amended to
 read as follows:
  (c) Such plan shall provide  for  the  method  of  classifying  risks,
 establishing  territories  and  making  rates  applicable  thereto. Such
 rates[, except with respect to rates for the minimum limits of insurance
 required by article six or seven of the vehicle and traffic law,]  shall
 be  based upon loss and expense experience of the risks insured pursuant
 to the plan.
  § 8. The insurance law is amended by adding a  new  section  405-a  to
 read as follows:
 A. 2109  7
 
  §  405-A.  COMPENSATION FOR REPORT OF INSURANCE FRAUD TO LAW ENFORCE-

 OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO COMMENCE AN ACTION OR IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY COMMENCES AN ACTION BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A
 PERSON PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION (A) OF  THIS  SECTION,  THEN  SUCH  PERSON
 SHALL  BE  ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AN AWARD OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN PERCENT, BUT
 NOT MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF  THE  PROCEEDS  OF  THE  ACTION  OR

  § 19. No later than eighteen months after the effective date  of  this
 act,  the superintendent of financial services shall study, evaluate and
 report to the governor and legislature on the impact and effect of  this
 act  on private passenger automobile insurance costs, by rating territo-

 sound underwriting and actuarial principles reasonably related to actual
 or  anticipated  loss  experience,  that  such reduction would result in
 underwriting losses for policies issued in such rating territory.

  § 21.  Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdi-
 vision,  section  or  part  contained  in  any part of this act shall be
 adjudged by any court of competent  jurisdiction  to  be  invalid,  such
 judgment  shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof,
 but shall be confined in its operation to the  clause,  sentence,  para-
 graph,  subdivision,  section  or part of this act contained in any part
 thereof directly involved in the  controversy  in  which  such  judgment
 shall  have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the
 legislature that this act would have been enacted even if  such  invalid
