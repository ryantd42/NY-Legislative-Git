  § 3. Subdivision 7 of section 1367 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering
 and  breeding  law, as added by section 3 of part Y of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  7. For the privilege of conducting sports wagering in the state, casi-
 nos  shall  pay a tax equivalent to ten percent of their sports wagering
 gross gaming revenue, excluding sports  wagering  gross  gaming  revenue
 attributed  to  mobile sports wagering offered pursuant to section thir-
 teen hundred sixty-seven-a of this title. Platform providers shall pay a
 tax constituting a certain  percentage  of  the  sports  wagering  gross
 gaming revenue attributed to mobile sports wagering offered through such
 platform  provider's  platform  pursuant  to  section  thirteen  hundred
 sixty-seven-a of this title;  provided  however,  that  such  percentage
 shall be determined [pursuant to a competitive bidding process conducted
 by  the commission] as outlined in subdivision seven of section thirteen
 hundred sixty-seven-a of this title; and  provided  further,  that  such
 percentage  shall  be  no  lower  than  twelve percent. [When awarding a
 license pursuant to  section  thirteen  hundred  sixty-seven-a  of  this
 title,  the  commission  may  set graduated tax rates; provided however,
 that any such tax rates may not be lower than the  minimum  rate  estab-
 lished  in  this  subdivision.]  THIS  TAX SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
 STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND FEES IMPOSED  ON  THE  OPERATION  OF,  OR  THE
 PROCEEDS  FROM,  THE OPERATION OF SPORTS WAGERING, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
 THIS SECTION AND SECTION THIRTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN-A OF THIS TITLE.
  § 4. Subdivision 8 of section 1367 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering
 and breeding law, as added by section 3 of part Y of chapter 59  of  the
 laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  8. Notwithstanding section thirteen hundred fifty-one of this article,
 mobile  sports  wagering  gross  gaming revenue and tax revenue shall be
 excluded from sports wagering gross  gaming  revenue  and  tax  revenue.
 Mobile  sports  wagering  tax revenue shall be separately maintained and
 returned to the state for deposit into the state lottery fund for educa-
 tion aid except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. Any  interest
 and  penalties  imposed  by  the commission relating to those taxes, all
 penalties levied and collected by the commission,  and  the  appropriate
 funds,  cash or prizes forfeited from sports wagering shall be deposited
 into the state lottery fund for education. In the first fiscal  year  in
 which  mobile  sports  wagering licensees commence operations and accept
 mobile sports wagers pursuant to this section, the commission shall  pay
 into  the commercial gaming fund one percent of the state tax imposed on
 mobile sports wagering by this section to  be  distributed  for  problem
 gambling  education  and  treatment  purposes pursuant to paragraph a of
 subdivision four of section ninety-seven-nnnn of the state finance  law;
 provided however, that such amount shall be equal to six million dollars
 for  each  fiscal  year  thereafter.  In  the first fiscal year in which
 mobile sports wagering licensees commence operations and  accept  mobile
 sports  wagers  pursuant  to  this section, the commission shall pay one
 percent of the state tax imposed  on  mobile  sports  wagering  by  this
 section  to the general fund, a program to be administered by the office
 of children and family services for a statewide youth sports  activities
 and  education  grant program for the purpose of providing annual awards
 to sports programs for underserved  youth  under  the  age  of  eighteen
 years; provided however, that such amount shall be equal to five million
 dollars for each fiscal year thereafter. The commission shall require at
 least  monthly  deposits by a platform provider of any payments pursuant
 to subdivision seven of this section, at such times, under  such  condi-
 tions,  and  in  such  depositories  as shall be prescribed by the state
 A. 3666  3
 
 comptroller.  IN A MONTH WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SPORTS WAGERING GROSS REVEN-
 UE FOR A PLATFORM PROVIDER IS A NEGATIVE NUMBER, SUCH PLATFORM  PROVIDER
 MAY  CARRY  OVER  THE NEGATIVE AMOUNT TO THE RETURN FILED FOR THE SUBSE-
 QUENT  MONTH.  HOWEVER, NO AMOUNT SHALL BE CARRIED OVER FOR A PERIOD OF
 MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE MONTH IN WHICH THE AMOUNT CARRIED OVER
 WAS ORIGINALLY DUE. The deposits shall be deposited to the credit of the
 state commercial gaming revenue fund. The  commission  shall  require  a
 monthly  report  and  reconciliation statement to be filed with it on or
 before the tenth day of each month, with respect to gross  revenues  and
 deposits received and made, respectively, during the preceding month.
  § 5. Subdivision 7 of section 1367-a of the racing, pari-mutuel wager-

 mation, fail to meet any platform provider and  mobile  sports  wagering
 operator  eligibility  criteria  established pursuant to the request for
 applications, or are deemed by the commission to have not satisfied  the
 criteria pursuant to subdivision five of this section.
  (a-1)  The  commission  shall publish on its website the criteria that
 will be used to score applications based upon the criteria set forth  in

  (d)  The  commission  shall  award  a license to [each of the two] THE

 however,  that  such  awards  shall require that [both] winning platform
 providers pay the same tax rate; and provided further, that the  commis-
 sion  shall  require  that  no  less  than [four] FOURTEEN mobile sports

 FERE WITH THE ABILITY OF PREVIOUSLY LICENSED PLATFORMS OR OPERATORS FROM
 CONTINUING TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. The commission may award  additional
 licenses  if  it  determines that such additional awards are in the best
 interests  of the state[; provided however, that any additional platform
 providers awarded licenses must also agree to pay the same tax  rate  as
 those  platform  providers  that  were initially awarded licenses by the
 commission]. The award of any such license shall require each  applicant
 to  remit  the  [highest] percentage of gross gaming revenue from mobile
 sports wagering [contained in an applicant's bid selected by the commis-
 sion considered for licensure. A qualified applicant shall  be  afforded
 the  ability  to revise its bid in any such manner in order for such bid
 to meet the percentage of gross gaming revenue from mobile sports wager-
 ing as required by the commission for license award, provided  that  the
 bid  does  not incorporate any additional operators not already included
 in the bid; and provided however  that  it  is  not  determined  by  the
 commission  that  the  revised  bid no longer meets all requirements and
 criteria established pursuant to this section and the request for appli-
 cations. Any applicant that does not revise its bid to meet the percent-
 age of gross gaming revenue from mobile sports wagering required by  the
 commission  for  license award shall not be awarded a license.] BASED ON
