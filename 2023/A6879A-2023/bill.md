 AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to requiring state agen-
  cies to publish certain information in  local,  community  and  ethnic
  media
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be  cited  as  the  "local,
 community and ethnic media commitment act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares  New  York  is  one  of  the most diverse states in America and
 local, community and ethnic media provides  an  important  way  for  the
 state  to  connect  and ensure that its message reaches all New Yorkers;
 and
  The legislature hereby finds and declares that according to  the  U.S.
 Census  population  estimates  for 2022, approximately 23 percent of New
 York state residents and 37 percent  of  New  York  city  residents  are
 foreign-born  and according to the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates
 approximately 30 percent of  New  York  state  residents  do  not  speak
 English as their primary language and 13 percent of New York state resi-
 dents  have  a  limited  ability  to  read,  speak, write, or understand
 English; and
  The legislature hereby finds and declares that the state of  New  York
 wants  to  ensure  that critical information about state services, poli-
 cies, and opportunities reach these communities and local, community and

 ethnic media is a pathway to allow members of these communities, many of
 whom critically need information  about  New  York  state  programs,  to
 access it; and
  Therefore,  the  legislature hereby finds and declares it is essential
 that all residents have meaningful access to state  programs,  services,
 and  activities, and the public safety, health, economic prosperity, and
 general welfare of all New York state residents is furthered by increas-
 ing access to New York state programs and services, regardless of native
 language, race, color, gender,  national  origin,  ethnicity,  religion,
 sexual orientation, disability or immigrant status.
  §  3.  The  executive  law is amended by adding a new section 164-e to
 read as follows:
