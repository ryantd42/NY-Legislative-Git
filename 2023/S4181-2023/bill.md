  2. THE MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC DRUG PRODUCT SHALL MAKE AVAILABLE  TO
 THE DEPARTMENT THE STUDIES AND SUMMARIES, INCLUDING BIOEQUIVALENCE DATA,
 THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE DATA, AND INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS, AND ASSO-
 CIATED  ANALYTICAL  METHODS, INCLUDING DISSOLUTION DATA AND TEST METHODS
 PROVIDED  TO  THE  FEDERAL  FOOD  AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF THE
 APPLICATION FOR SUCH GENERIC DRUG PRODUCT.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  MAKE
 SUCH INFORMATION FREELY AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE.
  §  3.  Paragraphs  (a) and (e) of subdivision 6 of section 6810 of the
 education law, paragraph (a) as amended by chapter 590 of  the  laws  of
 2011  and  paragraph  (e) as amended by chapter 357 of the laws of 2017,
 are amended to read as follows:
  (a) Every prescription written in this state by a person authorized to
 issue such prescription shall be on prescription  forms  containing  one
 line  for  the  prescriber's signature. The prescriber's signature shall
 validate the prescription. Every electronic prescription  shall  provide
 for  the  prescriber's  electronic  signature,  which shall validate the
 electronic prescription. Imprinted conspicuously on  every  prescription
 written  in  this state in eight point upper case type immediately below
 the signature line shall be the words: "THIS PRESCRIPTION WILL BE FILLED
 GENERICALLY UNLESS PRESCRIBER WRITES 'd a w' IN THE BOX  BELOW".  Unless
 the  prescriber  writes  d a w in such box in the prescriber's own hand-
 writing or, in the case of electronic prescriptions,  inserts  an  elec-
 tronic  direction  to  dispense  the  drug  as written, the prescriber's
 signature or electronic signature shall designate  approval  of  substi-
 tution  by a pharmacist of a GENERIC drug product pursuant to [paragraph
 (o) of subdivision one of] section [two hundred six] TWO HUNDRED  EIGHT-
 Y-D  of  the  public health law.  No other letters or marks in such box
 shall prohibit substitution. No prescription forms used or  intended  to
 be  used  by a person authorized to issue a prescription shall have 'd a
 w' preprinted in such box. Such box shall be placed directly  under  the
 signature  line  and shall be three-quarters inch in length and one-half
 inch in height, or in comparable form for an electronic prescription  as
 may  be  specified  by regulation of the commissioner. Immediately below
 such box shall be imprinted in six point type  the  words  "Dispense  As
 Written".  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, no state offi-
 cial, agency, board or other entity shall promulgate any  regulation  or
 guideline  modifying  those elements of the prescription form's contents
 specified in this subdivision. To the extent otherwise permitted by law,
 a prescriber may modify only those elements of the  prescription  form's
 contents  not  specified  in this subdivision. Notwithstanding any other
 provision of this section or any other law, when a generic drug  is  not
 available and the brand name drug originally prescribed is available and
 the  pharmacist  agrees  to  dispense the brand name product for a price
 that will not exceed the price that would  have  been  charged  for  the
 generic substitute had it been available, substitution of a generic drug
 product  will not be required. If the generic drug product is not avail-
 able and a medical emergency  situation,  which  for  purposes  of  this
 section is defined as any condition requiring alleviation of severe pain
 or  which  threatens  to  cause  disability or take life if not promptly
 treated, exists, then the pharmacist may dispense the brand name product
 at his regular price. In such instances the pharmacist must  record  the
 date,  hour  and  nature  of  the  medical  emergency on the back of the
 prescription and keep a copy of all such prescriptions.
  (e) No prescriber shall be subjected to civil liability arising solely
 from authorizing, in accordance with this subdivision, the  substitution
 by  a pharmacist of a GENERIC drug product pursuant to [paragraph (o) of
 S. 4181  3

 subdivision one of] section two hundred [six]  EIGHTY-D  of  the  public
 health law.
  § 4. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 6816-a of the education
 law,  as added by chapter 776 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (b) The substituted drug product is contained in the list  of  GENERIC
 drug  products established pursuant to [paragraph (o) of subdivision one
 of] section [two hundred six] TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-D of the public  health
 law; and
  §  5.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
