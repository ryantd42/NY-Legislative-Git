 AN  ACT  to amend the labor law, in relation to raising the minimum wage
  annually by a percentage which is based on inflation and providing for
  the enforcement of such minimum wage; and to repeal subdivision  6  of
  section 652 of the labor law relating thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "raise  the
 wage act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings. As New Yorkers struggle with the rapidly
 rising cost of living, their paychecks are not  keeping  up.  The  state
 minimum  wage  has  been flat at $15 in New York city since 2019. In the
 New York city suburbs it is also stalled at $15 and  under  current  law
 will not increase further. And in the rest of the state, years after the
 legislature  last  acted to raise the minimum wage it is still gradually
 inching up to $15, but will not increase further until  the  legislature
 acts.
  At  the  same  time, record inflation is causing the real value of the
 minimum wage to plummet across the state as consumers struggle with  the
 rapidly  rising  cost  of  necessities.  In New York city, its value has
 already fallen more than 15%, and is projected to fall a further 15%  by
 2027, or even more if consumer price inflation does not moderate in 2023
 and  2024 as expected. This steep decline in the minimum wage is revers-
 ing the historic reductions in poverty and earnings inequality that  the
 state  achieved  with  the  $15  minimum  wage.  And even once inflation

 returns to more typical levels, workers will continue to lose real wages
 as long as our minimum wage remains stagnant.
  While  in  2016  New York led the nation as the first state to adopt a
 $15 minimum wage, today it has fallen behind the many other  cities  and
 states that are raising their minimum wages well beyond $15. About fifty
 cities  and counties and two states will have minimum wages above $15 an
 hour as of January 2023, and a growing group will have minimum wages  of
 more  than $17 or $18 an hour. The fact that Yakima, Washington, Fresno,
 California, and Denver, Colorado will all have higher minimum wages than
 New York shows how far pay has fallen in the state.
  To fix this, first, the value of New York city's minimum wage needs to
 be restored by "catching it up" to where it would have been  if  it  had
 been  adjusted  steadily  each  year since 2019 to keep pace with rising
 prices and workforce productivity. That translates to raising the  mini-
 mum wage to $21.25 an hour by 2026.
  Second,  because  the  state  minimum wage in New York city's suburbs,
 including Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester counties, is also stalled  at
 $15  and  those regions have housing and living costs that are almost as
 high as New York city, the minimum wage there  should  increase  at  the
 same rate.
  Third,  the  minimum  wage  in  the remainder of the state should also
 eventually catch up with the state-wide rate, but at a slower pace since
 wages and costs are lower there.
  Finally, once the minimum wage across the state catches up, it must be
 automatically adjusted or "indexed" each year so that  it  doesn't  fall
 behind  again.  That is the approach that 18 states and Washington, D.C.
 are already using to keep their minimum wages up to date. For  adjusting
 the minimum wage each year, the legislature should adopt the same formu-
 la  that  the  department  of  labor and the division of the budget used
 successfully to increase New York's upstate minimum  wage  in  2022  and
 2023. They have been adjusting the minimum wage so that it keeps up both
 with  rising  prices and also with any increases in worker productivity.
 This best practice ensures that underpaid  workers'  paychecks  maintain
 their  purchasing power and, that when there are gains in worker produc-
 tivity, that workers too share in  those  benefits.  This  approach  has
 resulted  in  steady, moderate increases in the upstate wage of 70 cents
 in 2022, and $1.00 in 2023. It should be  made  permanent  and  expanded
 state-wide.
  Many  of  our  lowest  paid  jobs across the state are publicly-funded
 human services jobs, in fields such as home care, childcare, and  mental
 health  care,  where  workers provide essential services on which we all
 rely. But the eroded minimum wage is holding down pay  for  these  vital
 caregivers  and making it impossible to fill these demanding jobs at the
 same time that demand for services has exploded  as  the  state's  popu-
 lation  ages  and the pandemic has stressed families and communities. To
 address this critical worker shortage, we need to  not  just  raise  the
 minimum wage significantly, but also to provide the state funding neces-
 sary  to  finance those raises in the state and city-contracted programs
 that employ these essential workers.
  New York's experience phasing in the  $15  minimum  wage  showed  that
 significant  wage  increases have been manageable for employers and that
 higher paychecks have put money back into  local  communities,  boosting
 consumer  spending  at  neighborhood  businesses. Studies by the federal
 reserve bank of New York of the impact in upstate counties, and  by  the
 New  York  city-based new school both found that New York's last minimum
 wage increase raised pay significantly without hurting employment - even
 A. 2204--A  3
 
 in counties along the New York-Pennsylvania  border  where  the  minimum
 wage in our neighboring state is just $7.25.
  With the value of New York's minimum wage plummeting and rising prices
 squeezing  New  York's  working  families,  we  cannot afford to wait to
 restore a strong minimum wage for all New Yorkers.
