 AN  ACT  authorizing the county of Nassau assessor to accept an applica-
  tion for a real property tax  exemption  from  the  East  Meadow  Fire
  District
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the East Meadow Fire District, an application for  exemption  from  real
 property taxes pursuant to section 464 of the real property tax law with
 respect to the 2022-2023 assessment roll for all of the 2022-2023 school
 taxes  and  all  of the 2022 general taxes, for the parcel owned by such
 not-for-profit corporation with such parcels being located at  580  East
 Meadow  Avenue a/k/a 580 Newbridge Avenue, East Meadow, New York, other-
 wise known as Nassau county tax map section 50, block  332,  lots  89-91
 and 100-104.
  If  accepted,  the  application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the  taxable  status  date  established  for  such
 assessment rolls. If satisfied that such organization would otherwise be
 entitled to such exemption if such organization had filed an application
 for exemption by the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by the Nassau county legislature, may grant exemption from all
 taxation and make appropriate corrections to the subject roll.  If  such
 exemption  is  granted and such organization, therefore, shall have paid
 any tax with respect to the subject roll, the applicable governing  body
 or tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 the  taxes  paid, along with any fines or penalties paid, and cancel any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
