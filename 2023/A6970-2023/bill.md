  (F)  THE  PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL SUPPLEMENT ANY

 STATE LAND.
  2.  SUBJECT  TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION, THE
 commissioner of general services may, from time to time,  sell  unappro-
 priated  state lands at public auction or by sealed bids in such parcels
 as he deems for the best interests of the state. Previous to every sale,
 he OR SHE shall fix the lowest sum at which each lot may  be  sold,  and
 shall  designate at least one newspaper in the county where the lands to
 be sold are situated, in which the commissioner shall  cause  notice  of
 the time, place and description of sale to be published, at least once a
 week for four weeks, successively, before the sale. Such notice need not
 be  published  in  any  other paper or papers, and any statute requiring
 additional publication of notices or advertisements by state officers or
 a department, board, bureau or commission of the state shall  not  apply
 to  such  notice. The commissioner may designate a representative of his
 OR HER office to conduct such sale. All such sales shall be held at  the
 county  seat of the county where the property is situated, unless other-
 wise directed by the commissioner.
  Upon such sales of unappropriated state land to a  purchaser  procured
 by any licensed real estate broker and the payment of the purchase price
 in  the  amount  offered  by such broker in behalf of the purchaser, the
 commissioner of general services is authorized to pay, subject  to  such
 terms  and conditions as the commissioner may prescribe, a commission to
 such broker out of monies available therefor. Uniform rates  of  commis-
 sion  shall,  from  time to time, be fixed by the commissioner but shall
 not exceed six [percentum] PER CENTUM of the purchase price. No  commis-
 sion  shall  be  paid  for  the procuring of any sale unless (1) written
 authority of the broker to make such offer on a form acceptable  to  the
 commissioner,  signed  by the person for whom he OR SHE is acting, shall
 be filed with the commissioner before the day of the sale and unless (2)
 the broker shall furnish to the commissioner evidence in such  form  and
 extent as he may require establishing that the purchaser was procured as
 the  result  of the broker's services. In no event shall a broker who is
 paid a commission by the commissioner  as  herein  provided  accept  any
 other commission or fee from any person or source for brokerage services
 relating to the sale of such unappropriated state land.
  [2.]  3. (a) Whenever a street or highway, including any adjacent land
 acquired or held by the state in connection with such street or highway,
 the title to the bed of which is in the state, shall have  been  legally
 abandoned  or  closed,  in whole or in part, the commissioner of general
 services may sell and convey at public auction or by sealed bids at  not
 less than the appraised value, in such parcels as he OR SHE directs, all
 the  right,  title and interest of the state in such abandoned or closed
 street or highway, or the part so abandoned or closed, and in any  adja-
 cent  land  acquired or held by the state in connection with such street
 or highway; and where, in the judgment of such  commissioner,  a  public
 auction  is not for the best interests of the state the commissioner, in
 his OR HER discretion, may sell and convey such parcels of said lands at
 private sale to the owners of adjacent lands for a price not  less  than
 the appraised value and on such terms and conditions as the commissioner
 may impose.
 A. 6970  4
 
  (b)  The  commissioner of general services may sell and convey parcels
 of unappropriated state land which (i) do not constitute legal  building
 lots  in  the  municipality  in  which they are located and (ii) have an
 appraised value of less than fifty thousand dollars each at private sale
 to  any  owner  of adjacent lands. Consideration for such sales shall be
 for a price not less than the appraised value and such additional  terms
 and conditions as the commissioner may deem necessary.
  [3.]  4.  The commissioner of general services is authorized in his OR
 HER discretion to sell and convey at private sale upon  such  terms  and
 conditions as he OR SHE may deem proper, and to remise and quitclaim all
 the  right, title and interest of the state in and to any unappropriated
 state lands acquired by or through tax sale where it shall  appear  that
 such  lands  are  and  have been privately occupied under color of title
 continuously for ten years or where the applicant has, in good faith,  a
 continuous  chain  of title going back more than ten years from the date
 of application. Any such sale, if  made,  shall  be  to  the  person  or
 persons claiming title because of such occupation or under such chain of
 title,  and  shall  be for a consideration not less than the fair market
 value of the state's interest as determined by the commissioner.
  [4.] 5. Where a petition is presented to a surrogate's court  of  this
 state  for an order directing the sale of a decedent's real property for
 any of the purposes provided for in section one  thousand  nine  hundred
 two  of  the  surrogate's court procedure act or otherwise, and there is
 reason to believe that such real property  may  have  escheated  to  the
 people  of  the  state of New York, and a final judgment in an action by
 reason of such escheat, as provided for in section two hundred [and] one
 of the abandoned property law, has not been entered, the commissioner of
 general services may, if it is deemed to be in the best interests of the
 state, authorize the attorney general to consent to such order  for  the
 sale  of  such real property, either at public auction or by sealed bids
 or private sale. A deed thereupon executed and delivered pursuant to the
 terms and provisions of such order, upon such consent  of  the  attorney
 general,  shall  be  deemed a bar to any claim of title of the people of
 the state of New York, by virtue of such escheat,  in  the  property  so
 sold,  but  shall  not be deemed to affect any rights that the people of
 the state of New York may have in or  to  the  proceeds  of  such  sale.
 Consent,  however,  to such an order shall not be given in the event the
 price offered on a proposed private sale of such real property  is  less
 than  the  appraised  value thereof as determined by the commissioner of
 general services.
  [5.] 6. (a) The commissioner of general services may sell  and  convey
 improved,  unappropriated  state  lands  by  competitive solicitation of
 offers through a request for proposals or similar method where in his or
 her judgment, a public auction is not  in  the  best  interests  of  the
 state.  Such  solicitation  shall  document  the minimum qualitative and
 quantitative factors in addition to sale price to be used as criteria in
 the evaluation of offers and the general manner in which the  evaluation
 process  and selection of the most responsive and responsible offeror is
 to be conducted. Clarifications may be sought from offerors for purposes
 of assuring a full understanding of responsiveness to  the  solicitation
 requirements.  Where  provided for in the solicitation, revisions may be
 permitted from  all  offerors  determined  to  be  eligible  for  award.
 Disclosure  of  the  content of competing offers, other than statistical
 tabulations of offers received or of  any  clarifications  or  revisions
 thereto,  shall  be  prohibited  prior to award. All offers or separable
 parts thereof may be rejected.
 A. 6970  5
 
  (b) Establishment of the minimum sale price for the competitive solic-
 itation shall be based upon a certified appraisal or certified appraisal
 report as defined in article six-E of the executive law.
  (c)  The commissioner of general services shall designate at least one
 newspaper in the county where the lands to be offered  are  situate,  in
 which he or she shall cause a notice of the solicitation to be published
 at  least  once  a  week for four weeks successively before the date set
 forth for receipt of offers.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
