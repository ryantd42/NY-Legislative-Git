  enter into reciprocity agreements with other states, countries,  prov-
  inces or territories that issue driver licenses
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The commissioner of motor vehicles is hereby authorized  to
 enter  into  agreements with other parties that issue driver licenses to
 provide reciprocity in issuing driver licenses between citizens from the
 state of New York residing in the respective state, country, province or
 territory and to the citizens from  such  state,  country,  province  or
 territory  residing  in  the  state of New York. The parties shall agree
 that reciprocal provisions for issuance and skills to acquire  a  driver
 license  shall be applicable in the state of New York and in the respec-
 tive state, country, province or territory. The  commissioner  of  motor
 vehicles  may  only enter into such reciprocal agreements with a  state,
 country, province or territory that has a comparable licensing  process,
 including without limitation, knowledge and road tests, and may  enter
 into  reciprocal  agreements  providing  for  additional  education with
 respect to the operating laws, rules, and regulations of the  respective
 state, country, province or territory.
  § 2. For any such reciprocal agreement entered into, the parties shall
 agree  that  a holder of a valid driver license of the state of New York
 residing in such state, country, province or territory, shall be able to
 exchange such license for a driver license issued by such  state,  coun-
 try,  province or territory at the nominal conversion fee, without being
 required to pass the knowledge and road test. Correspondingly, a  holder
 of  a  valid  driver  license  from  another state, country, province or

 territory lawfully residing in the state of New York, who is not  exempt
 from  licensing requirements under the vehicle and traffic law, shall be
 able to exchange their license for a standard license in  the  state  of
 New  York  at the nominal conversion fee, without being required to pass
 the knowledge and road test.
  § 3. The state of New York, through the commissioner  of  motor  vehi-
 cles,  and  the respective ministry or department of the state, country,
 province or territory, shall agree on the following:
  1. Each party to  this  agreement  shall  provide  samples  of  driver
 licenses  (or  copies  thereof) issued at the time of this agreement and
 thereafter, as well as a definition of all classes of  driver  licenses,
 notations and restrictions;
  2.  This  agreement shall only apply to holders of unrestricted driver
 licenses aged 18 or older  and  shall  not  apply  to  applications  for
 enhanced  licenses  pursuant  to section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform
 and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law 108-458,  real  IDs  or
 driver  licenses  for  the  operation  of  a commercial motor vehicle or
 motorcycle.
  3. For the decision on the issuance of  a  driver  license,  the  same
 standards, rules and regulations as for any resident of the state of New
 York  and/or  the respective state, country, province or territory shall
 apply.
  4. Each party shall agree to verify whether the  driver  still  has  a
 valid  driver  license  of  the  state in which he or she was originally
 licensed, provided that the commissioner of motor vehicles shall  ensure
 that  driver information for no other driver licensed in the state other
 than the driver applying for  the  reciprocal  license  is  shared  when
 conducting such verification and designing such verification system, and
 shall  ensure that any information necessary to be shared, if any, shall
 substantially comply with federal and state law for purposes of a recip-
 rocal license application. For purposes of this section, "driver  infor-
 mation"  shall  include,  but  not  be limited to, any portion or record
 retained by the commissioner of motor vehicles in relation to a non-com-
 mercial driver license or renewal application that  contains  the  photo
 image  or  identifies  the  social  security  number, address, telephone
 number, place of birth, age, country of  origin,  place  of  employment,
 school  or educational institution attended, source of income, status as
 a recipient of public benefits, customer identification  number  associ-
 ated  with  a public utilities account, and medical information or disa-
 bility information.
  § 4. The agreement shall be signed by both the commissioner  of  motor
 vehicles  of  the state of New York and an official with legal authority
 to enter into such agreement on behalf of the respective state, country,
 province or territory and may be cancelled  or  revoked  in  writing  by
 either  party  at  any time and for any reason with three months' notice
 provided that notification shall be sent to the address provided by  the
 parties in the agreement.
  §  5. The commissioner of motor vehicles shall report to the governor,
 the temporary president of the senate, and the speaker of  the  assembly
 on  agreements  entered  into pursuant to section one of this act within
 one year of the date this act shall have become a law and annually ther-
 eafter.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
