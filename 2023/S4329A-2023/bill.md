  Section 1. The commissioner of motor  vehicles  shall  enter  into  an
 agreement  with  the  Republic of China (Taiwan) through the Ministry of
 Transportation and Communications represented by the Director General of
 the Taipei Economic and Cultural office in New York for  reciprocity  in
 issuing  driver licenses to citizens from the state of New York residing
 in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to the Taiwanese citizens residing
 in the state of New  York.  The  parties  shall  agree  that  reciprocal
 provisions  for issuance and skills to acquire a driver license shall be
 applicable in New York and in the Republic of China (Taiwan).
  § 2. The parties shall agree that a holder of a valid  driver  license
 of  the  state  of  New York residing in the Republic of China (Taiwan),

 the nominal conversion fee, without being required to pass the knowledge
 and road test. Correspondingly, a holder of  a  valid  Taiwanese  driver
 license  lawfully  residing  in the state of New York, who is not exempt
 from licensing requirements under the vehicle and traffic law, shall  be
 able to exchange a Taiwanese license for a standard license in the state
 of  New  York  at  the nominal conversion fee, without being required to
 pass the knowledge and road test.
  § 3. The state of New York, through the commissioner  of  motor  vehi-
 cles, and the Republic of China (Taiwan), through the Ministry of Trans-
