 subject shall be acted upon, except such as the governor  may  recommend
 for  consideration.  The  governor  shall  communicate by message to the
 legislature at every session the condition of the state,  and  recommend
 such  matters  to  it  as  he or she shall judge expedient. The governor
 shall expedite all such measures as may be resolved upon by the legisla-
 ture, and shall  take  care  that  the  laws  are  faithfully  executed.
 SUBJECT  AND PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS AS MAY BE ENACTED TO THIS EFFECT, THE
 GOVERNOR, AND ALL OTHER STATE OFFICERS SUBJECT TO  SENATE  CONFIRMATION,
 SHALL  PERIODICALLY  APPEAR  BEFORE THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AS

 DEEM PROPER. The governor shall receive for his or her services an annu-
 al salary to be fixed by joint resolution of the  senate  and  assembly,
 and  there shall be provided for his or her use a suitable and furnished
