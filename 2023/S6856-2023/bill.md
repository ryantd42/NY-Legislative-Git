  2. He OR SHE marks the body of a child less than  eighteen  years  old
 with indelible ink or pigments by means of tattooing; or
  3. He or she sells or causes to be sold tobacco in any form to a child
 less than twenty-one years old; OR
  4. BEING AN OWNER, LESSEE, MANAGER OR EMPLOYEE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT, HE
 OR  SHE  PERMITS A CHILD LESS THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD TO ENTER OR REMAIN
