 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. J. A. GIGLIO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Jamesport Fire  District  to  file
  an application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the  town  of  Riverhead, county  of  Suffolk,  is here-
 by authorized to accept from the Jamesport Fire District, an application
 for exemption  from  real property taxes pursuant to section 464 of  the
 real  property  tax law with respect to the 2021-2022 assessment roll,
 for  the  parcels  owned  by such organization, with such parcels  being
 located  at  41  Manor Lane, in the village of Jamesport, town of River-
 head, county of Suffolk, otherwise known  as  Suffolk county  tax  map
 district  0600, section  068.00,  block 02.00, lot 010.006.
  If accepted, the application shall be  reviewed  as  if  it  had  been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If  satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption if such organization had filed an application for exemption by
 the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval by  the
 town  of  Riverhead  board, may grant exemption from all taxation and
 make  appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such exemption  is
 granted  and  such  organization  therefore shall have paid any tax with
 respect to  the  subject  roll,  the applicable governing  body  or  tax
 department  may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of the
 taxes  paid, along  with  any  fines  or penalties paid, and cancel  any
 taxes, fines,  penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
