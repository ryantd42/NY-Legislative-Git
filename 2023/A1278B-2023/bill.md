  Section  1.  The labor law is amended by adding a new section 191-d to

  § 191-D. NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS. 1. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  SECTION,
 THE TERM:
  (A)  "NON-COMPETE  AGREEMENT" MEANS ANY AGREEMENT, OR CLAUSE CONTAINED
 IN ANY EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT, BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER  AND  AN  EMPLOYEE  THAT

 THE CONCLUSION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH THE EMPLOYER INCLUDED AS  A  PARTY  TO
 THE AGREEMENT; AND

 TO THAT OTHER PERSON, IN A POSITION OF ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON, AND UNDER
 AN OBLIGATION TO PERFORM DUTIES FOR, THAT OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING  INDE-
 PENDENT CONTRACTORS.
  2.  NO  EMPLOYER  OR  ITS AGENT, OR THE OFFICER OR AGENT OF ANY CORPO-
 RATION, PARTNERSHIP, OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, SHALL SEEK,  REQUIRE,
 DEMAND OR ACCEPT A NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT FROM ANY COVERED EMPLOYEE.

  4.  (A)  A  COVERED  EMPLOYEE,  MAY BRING A CIVIL ACTION IN A COURT OF
 COMPETENT JURISDICTION AGAINST ANY EMPLOYER OR PERSONS ALLEGED  TO  HAVE
 VIOLATED  THIS  SECTION.  AN EMPLOYEE SHALL BRING SUCH ACTION WITHIN TWO
 YEARS OF THE LATER OF: (I) WHEN THE PROHIBITED NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT WAS
 SIGNED;  (II)  WHEN  THE  EMPLOYEE  LEARNS OF THE PROHIBITED NON-COMPETE
 AGREEMENT; (III) WHEN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED; OR (IV)
 WHEN THE EMPLOYER TAKES ANY STEP TO ENFORCE THE  NON-COMPETE  AGREEMENT.
 THE COURT SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO VOID ANY SUCH NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
 AND  TO ORDER ALL APPROPRIATE RELIEF, INCLUDING ENJOINING THE CONDUCT OF
 ANY PERSON OR EMPLOYER; ORDERING  PAYMENT  OF  LIQUIDATED  DAMAGES;  AND
 AWARDING  LOST  COMPENSATION,  DAMAGES,  REASONABLE  ATTORNEYS' FEES AND
 COSTS.
  (B) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SHALL  BE
 CALCULATED  AS  AN  AMOUNT NOT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE COURT
 SHALL AWARD LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO EVERY  EMPLOYEE  AFFECTED  UNDER  THIS
 SECTION, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER REMEDIES PERMITTED BY THIS SECTION.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
