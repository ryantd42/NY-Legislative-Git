  COMMENDING  the  Veterans Outreach Center upon the
  occasion of celebrating its 50th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
veterans' organizations which have positively impacted and substantially
contributed to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Veterans  Outreach  Center of Rochester, New York upon the
occasion of celebrating its 50th Anniversary; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1973 by returning Vietnam Veterans, the Veterans
Outreach Center (VOC) remains anchored in the  community  and  offers  a
comprehensive  portfolio  of  supportive  services  designed to meet the
needs of veterans and their families;  through  the  generosity  of  the
community,  all their programs and services are provided free of charge;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Veterans Outreach Center offers employment,  education,
wellness,  and  housing  programs,  with  more  than  1,000 veterans and
families connecting with the services offered through this  organization
every year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  organization offers job training programs, employment
assistance, mental health support, a  fitness  center,  hydromassage,  a
barbershop,  social  clubs  and therapeutic groups, housing for homeless
veterans and low-income  veteran  families,  food,  clothing,  free  bus
passes,  an  emergency  fund,  case  management  for  veterans  that are
justice-involved, and more to veterans across the Finger  Lakes  region;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1973,  the  VOC  was  initially  founded  as "Veterans
Outreach Project" under the non-profit known  as  Action  for  a  Better
Community,  with  funding  provided  from  Congress; when the government
ended the program, citizens of the Rochester  community  knew  something
must be done to continue their dedicated support for local veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1979, "Veterans Outreach Project" turned into Veterans
Outreach Center, an  independent,  non-profit  organization  whose  sole
mission was to help veterans in need; despite funding challenges off and
on over the last half century, they have not only remained in operation,
but  also  significantly  expanded  their  reach to now serve over 1,500
veterans each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, As part of  its  health  and  wellness  services,  the  new
Veterans  Outreach  Center's  fitness  center  provides  a  space  where
veterans can decompress, get in a good workout, and connect  with  other
veterans;  the  fitness  center  is  designed  to  be individualized and
welcoming to veterans of all fitness levels; and
 
  WHEREAS, Earlier in 2023, the Veterans Outreach Center broke  ground
on a new $7 million project, focused on expansion at the Richards House,
 
a  residence  for  homeless veterans located in the South Wedge; this is
the organization's largest capital project to date, with the renovations
to Richards House being part of the VOC's Operation Safe Haven campaign,
which  is  focused  on  creating  additional  transitional and emergency
housing units; this project will  increase  the  total  number  of  beds
available to homeless veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Designed with veterans in mind, this landmark project will
also include adding an elevator for the three-story building,  expanding
laundry  and  common  spaces,  and the creation of additional bathrooms;
furthermore, there will be more privacy available to residents, shifting
from four- to- six-person bays to single-  and  double-occupancy  rooms;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  focused  on the betterment of the veterans in their
community, the employees and volunteers of the Veterans Outreach  Center
work  unrelentingly  to  provide  beneficial and enduring programs which
shape the lives of veterans in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  important  milestone  in the history of the Veterans
Outreach Center, wishing the organization countless years  of  sparkling
success  in  the  future; the likes of which it has grown accustomed to;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Veterans  Outreach Center upon the occasion of celebrating
its 50th Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Veterans Outreach Center of Rochester, New York.
