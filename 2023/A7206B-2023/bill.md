  cations  and owner liability for a violation of traffic-control signal
  indications in the county of Westchester; to amend the public officers
  law, in relation to accessing records; and providing for the repeal of

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  vehicle  and  traffic law is amended by adding a new
 section 1111-g to read as follows:
  § 1111-G. OWNER LIABILITY FOR  FAILURE  OF  OPERATOR  TO  COMPLY  WITH
 TRAFFIC-CONTROL  INDICATIONS. (A) 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION
 OF LAW, THE COUNTY OF WESTCHESTER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED  TO
 ADOPT  AND  AMEND  A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING A DEMONSTRATION
 PROGRAM IMPOSING MONETARY LIABILITY ON THE OWNER OF A VEHICLE FOR  FAIL-
 URE OF AN OPERATOR THEREOF TO COMPLY WITH TRAFFIC-CONTROL INDICATIONS IN
 SUCH  COUNTY  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. SUCH
 DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM SHALL EMPOWER SUCH COUNTY TO INSTALL  AND  OPERATE
 TRAFFIC-CONTROL  SIGNAL  PHOTO  VIOLATION-MONITORING  DEVICES AT NO MORE
 THAN FIFTY INTERSECTIONS WITHIN AND UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COUN-
 TY AT ANY ONE TIME.
  2. SUCH DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM SHALL UTILIZE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGIES  TO
 ENSURE,  TO  THE  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE, THAT PHOTOGRAPHS PRODUCED BY SUCH
 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL  PHOTO  VIOLATION-MONITORING  SYSTEMS  SHALL  NOT
 INCLUDE IMAGES THAT IDENTIFY THE DRIVER, THE PASSENGERS, OR THE CONTENTS
 OF  THE  VEHICLE.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO NOTICE OF LIABILITY ISSUED
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE DISMISSED SOLELY BECAUSE A  PHOTOGRAPH
 OR  PHOTOGRAPHS  ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTENTS OF A VEHI-
 CLE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH COUNTY HAS MADE A REASONABLE  EFFORT  TO  COMPLY
 WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION (A) OF THIS SECTION,  THE  OWNER  OF  A  VEHICLE

 PRESCRIBED TIME PERIOD.
  (F) AN IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY UNDER A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE  ADOPTED
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONVICTION AS AN OPERATOR
 AND  SHALL  NOT  BE MADE PART OF THE OPERATING RECORD OF THE PERSON UPON

 PURPOSES IN THE PROVISION OF MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE COVERAGE.

 ELEVEN  HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION THAT THE
 VEHICLE HAD BEEN REPORTED TO THE POLICE AS STOLEN PRIOR TO THE TIME  THE

 NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE LESSEE CLEARLY LEGIBLE, WITHIN THIRTY-SEVEN DAYS
 AFTER  RECEIVING  NOTICE  FROM  THE  COURT  OF THE DATE AND TIME OF SUCH
 VIOLATION, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL

 TY-SEVEN DAY TIME PERIOD SHALL RENDER THE OWNER LIABLE FOR  THE  PENALTY
 PRESCRIBED  BY  THIS  SECTION.  WHERE  THE  LESSOR  COMPLIES  WITH  THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE LESSEE OF SUCH VEHICLE ON  THE  DATE
 OF  SUCH  VIOLATION  SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE THE OWNER OF SUCH VEHICLE FOR
 PURPOSES OF  THIS  SECTION,  SHALL  BE  SUBJECT  TO  LIABILITY  FOR  THE
 VIOLATION  OF  SUBDIVISION  (D) OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS
 ARTICLE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND SHALL BE SENT A NOTICE OF LIABILITY
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION (G) OF THIS SECTION.
  (K) 1. IF THE OWNER LIABLE FOR  A  VIOLATION  OF  SUBDIVISION  (D)  OF
 SECTION  ELEVEN  HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
 WAS NOT THE OPERATOR OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF  THE  VIOLATION,  THE
 OWNER MAY MAINTAIN AN ACTION FOR INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST THE OPERATOR.
  2.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, NO OWNER OF A
 VEHICLE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A MONETARY FINE  IMPOSED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
