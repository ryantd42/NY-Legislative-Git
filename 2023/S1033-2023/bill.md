 eligible  affected  business  or  organization  pursuant  to  this  act.
 Subject to the cessation of new claim approvals under subdivision (d) of

 claims to the comptroller, who shall pay from the general fund  any  and
 all claims submitted by the department.
  (b)  Any  bank  or credit union may apply to the department to partic-
 ipate in the loan guarantee program. Not later  than  one  business  day
 after  receiving the application, the department shall determine whether
 the financial institution is an eligible financial institution and imme-
 diately notify the bank or  credit  union  of  such  determination.  Any
 eligible financial institution may make loans to affected businesses and
 organizations in accordance with this act.
  (c)  Each eligible financial institution that makes a loan pursuant to
 this act, shall notify the department in  writing  not  later  than  one
 business  day  after  making the loan, specifying such information about
 the borrower as the department may request.
  § 3. Loan eligibility. An eligible financial institution  may  make  a
 loan to an affected business or organization, provided:
  (a) The affected business or organization has provided to the eligible
 financial  institution  proof satisfactory to such institution that such
 affected business or organization is an affected business  or  organiza-

  (b)  The  amount  of  the  loan shall not exceed seventy-five thousand

  (c) The loan is made in accordance with the eligible financial  insti-
 tution's  underwriting  policy  and standards, provided further that the
 affected business or organization's  creditworthiness  shall  not  be  a
 factor used for the purposes of determining eligibility.
  (d)  The  loan  agreement  shall  not (i) require repayment during the
 grace period, or (ii) charge interest on the principal amount before  or
 during  the  grace period or for one hundred eighty days after the grace
 period, provided after such one hundred eighty-day period, the  eligible
 financial  institution  may  charge  interest or fees in accordance with
 such financial institution's lending policy and the terms of the  under-
 lying loan agreement.

 business or organization, provided no affected business or  organization
 may  receive  more  than  three loans under the program. Each additional
 loan shall be made in accordance with section three of this  act.  The
 total  amount of all loans received by an affected business or organiza-
 tion shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars.

  § 5. Collection of loans. (a) On and after  one  hundred  eighty  days
 from the end of the grace period, an eligible financial institution that
 has made a good-faith effort to collect the outstanding principal from a
 loan  issued pursuant to this act may make a claim to the department for
 recovery  of an amount equal to the outstanding principal for such loan.
 Prior to the department's approving and submitting a claim to the  comp-
 troller,  such  eligible  financial institution shall demonstrate to the
 satisfaction of the department that the eligible  financial  institution
 has  made  a good-faith effort to collect the outstanding principal from
 the eligible small business or not-for-profit organization  employee  in
 accordance  with  such  financial  institution's  loan  servicing  and
 collection policies. Upon payment of a claim, the loan shall be assigned
 to the state, and the  department  shall  have  the  right  to  continue
 collection efforts on the loan.
  (b)  The  department  shall  maintain records in the regular course of
 administration of the loan guarantee  program,  including  a  record  of
 loans  issued and of payments made to honor loan guarantees issued under
 this act. The department shall regularly review such records  to  deter-
 mine total loans issued and identify duplicative applications.
  (c)  The  department  may terminate any loan guarantee if the eligible
 financial institution misrepresents any information  pertaining  to  the
 guarantee  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  requirements of this act in
 connection with the guarantee of the underlying loan.
  (d) If the amounts expended to honor loan guarantees under the program
 exceed ten percent of total loans issued,  the  department  shall  imme-
 diately  cease  to  approve  claims and shall notify the comptroller and
 each eligible financial institution of the total amount of payments made
 and that the department has ceased honoring loan guarantees.
  (e) Any interest deferred or not charged  related  to  a  loan  issued
 pursuant  to  this  act shall be exempt from all state taxes that may be
 applicable to such interest amounts as they relate to an affected  busi-
 ness or organization.  Eligible financial institutions shall disclose to
 affected  business  or organization borrowers in the signed affidavit or
 loan documents that there may be federal tax consequences to the program
 loans.
  (f) No new loan applications shall  be  submitted  under  the  program
 after  the  coronavirus pandemic ends. The program shall expire upon the
 repayment of all loans made under the program  and,  for  all  loans  in
 default,  the  repayment of claims made under the program, or the cessa-
 tion of new claim approvals under subdivision (d) of this section.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
