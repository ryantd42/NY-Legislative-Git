  COMMEMORATING  the  31st Anniversary of the Queens
  LGBTQ Pride Parade on June 4, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  the
profound  impact  of those exemplary organizations and events within the
great State of New York that proactively work toward the empowerment  of
diverse  communities and the importance of such work, which benefits all
citizens of this State, and indeed, all citizens of the  Nation,  should
be rightfully commended; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 31st Anniversary of the Queens LGBTQ Pride Parade to be
celebrated on Sunday, June 4, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Queens LGBTQ Pride Parade  is  the  second  oldest  and
second  largest  Pride  parade in New York City; the parade, which takes
place every year on the first Sunday in June, was established in 1993 by
Daniel Dromm and Maritza Martinez to increase  awareness  of  the  LGBTQ
population in Queens and honor former resident Julio Rivera; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Julio  Rivera  was  a  29-year-old  Puerto Rican bartender
raised in the Bronx  who  was  living  in  Jackson  Heights  when  three
individuals  from  a  local gang brutally attacked him due to his sexual
orientation  on  July  2,  1990;  doctors  at  Elmhurst  Hospital  later
confirmed  his  death,  and  residents  of  Jackson  Heights have worked
relentlessly  since  then  to  increase  the  visibility  of  the  LGBTQ
community not only in Jackson Heights but across New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Queens Pride marked the beginning of local LGBTQ activists
founding social  services  organizations  and  strengthening  the  LGBTQ
community's  political  agenda;  since then, the number of organizations
that provide services to members of the LGBTQ community  has  increased;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Queens  Pride  promotes  awareness  and  education  of the
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community in Queens,  and
serves as a safe space for those within the community to celebrate their
identity,  as  well  as honor those who have passed; Queens Pride is and
will continue to be an essential parade  for  residents  throughout  New
York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  society  benefits  from  the  purposeful  efforts  of
individuals who unite for the cause of improving the quality of life for
others and who proactively work toward the goal of dignity for all; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  31st Anniversary of the Queens LGBTQ Pride Parade; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the New Queens Pride.
