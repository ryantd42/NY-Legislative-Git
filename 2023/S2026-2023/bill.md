  §  3.  Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of section 355 of the economic develop-
 ment law, as amended by of chapter 494 of the laws of 2022, are  amended
 to read as follows:
  1. Excelsior jobs tax credit component. A participant in the excelsior
 jobs program shall be eligible to claim a credit for each net new job it
 creates in New York state. In a project that is not a green project OR A
 MEDICAL  EQUIPMENT  PROJECT,  the amount of such credit per job shall be
 equal to the product of the gross wages paid and up to 6.85 percent.  In
 a green project, or a Green CHIPS project, the amount of such credit per
 job  shall be equal to the product of the gross wages paid and up to 7.5
 percent.  IN A MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PROJECT, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH CREDIT  PER
 JOB  SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THE GROSS WAGES PAID AND UP TO 8.5
 PERCENT. Provided, however, given the transformational nature  of  Green
 CHIPS  projects,  only  the  first two hundred thousand dollars of gross
 wages per job shall be eligible for this credit. The maximum  amount  of
 gross  wages  per  job  for  a  Green  CHIPS project may be adjusted for
 inflation at an annual amount determined by the commissioner in a manner
 substantially similar to the cost of living  adjustments  calculated  by
 the  United  States  Social  Security Administration based on changes in
 consumer price indices or a rate of four percent per year, whichever  is
 higher.
  2.  Excelsior  investment  tax  credit component. A participant in the
 excelsior jobs program shall be eligible to claim a credit on  qualified
 investments.  In  a  project  that  is  not a green project OR A MEDICAL
 EQUIPMENT PROJECT, the credit shall be equal to two percent of the  cost
 or  other basis for federal income tax purposes of the qualified invest-
 ment. In a green project, the credit shall be equal to five  percent  of
 the cost or other basis for federal income tax purposes of the qualified
 investment. IN A MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PROJECT, THE CREDIT SHALL BE EQUAL TO
 SEVEN PERCENT OF THE COST OR OTHER BASIS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
 OF  THE QUALIFIED INVESTMENT.  In a project for child care services or a
 Green CHIPS project, the credit shall be up to five percent of the  cost
 or  other basis for federal income tax purposes of the qualified invest-
 ment in child care services or in the Green CHIPS project as applicable.

 A participant may not claim both the  excelsior  investment  tax  credit
 component  and the investment tax credit set forth in subdivision one of
 section two hundred ten-B, subsection (a) of section  six  hundred  six,
 the  former  subsection  (i)  of  section fourteen hundred fifty-six, or
 subdivision (q) of section fifteen hundred eleven of the tax law for the
 same property in any taxable year, except that a participant  may  claim
 both  the  excelsior  investment tax credit component and the investment
 tax credit for research and development property. In addition, a taxpay-
 er who or which is qualified to claim the excelsior investment tax cred-
 it component and is also qualified  to  claim  the  brownfield  tangible
 property  credit  component  under section twenty-one of the tax law may
 claim either the excelsior  investment  tax  credit  component  or  such
 tangible  property  credit  component,  but  not  both  with regard to a
 particular piece of property. A credit may not be claimed until a  busi-
 ness  enterprise has received a certificate of tax credit, provided that
 qualified investments made on or after the issuance of  the  certificate
 of  eligibility but before the issuance of the certificate of tax credit
 to the business enterprise, may be claimed in the first taxable year for
 which the business enterprise is allowed to claim the  credit.  Expenses
 incurred  prior to the date the certificate of eligibility is issued are
 not eligible to be included in the calculation of the credit.
  3. Excelsior research and development tax credit component. A  partic-
 ipant  in the excelsior jobs program shall be eligible to claim a credit
 equal to fifty percent of  the  portion  of  the  participant's  federal
 research  and  development  tax credit that relates to the participant's
 research and development expenditures in New York state during the taxa-
 ble year; provided however, if not a green project OR A  MEDICAL  EQUIP-
 MENT  PROJECT,  the  excelsior research and development tax credit shall
 not exceed six percent of the qualified research and development expend-
 itures attributable to activities conducted in New York state, or, if  a
 green project, A MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PROJECT or a Green CHIPS project, the
 excelsior  research  and  development  tax credit shall not exceed eight
 percent of the research and  development  expenditures  attributable  to
 activities  conducted  in  New  York  state. If the federal research and
 development credit  has  expired,  then  the  research  and  development
 expenditures  relating  to  the  federal research and development credit
 shall be calculated as if the federal research  and  development  credit
 structure  and  definition  in effect in two thousand nine were still in
 effect. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
 contrary, research and development expenditures in this state, including
 salary  or  wage  expenses  for jobs related to research and development
 activities in this state, may be used as the  basis  for  the  excelsior
 research and development tax credit component and the qualified emerging
 technology  company facilities, operations and training credit under the
 tax law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
