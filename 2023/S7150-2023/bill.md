 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Tourism,
  Parks and Recreation
 
 AN ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law,  in
  relation to creating the "Women's rights history trail" program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The parks, recreation  and  historic  preservation  law  is
 amended by adding a new article 42 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 42
  WOMEN'S RIGHTS HISTORY TRAIL PROGRAM
 SECTION 42.01 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  42.03 DEFINITIONS.
  42.05 GENERAL FUNCTIONS, POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSIONER.
  § 42.01 LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  THE  LEGISLATURE  RECOGNIZES  THAT  THE
 WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT IS ONE OF THE THREE GREAT PROTEST TRADITIONS  IN
 UNITED  STATES HISTORY, SHARING THAT STATUS WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR RACIAL
 EQUALITY AND THE LABOR MOVEMENTS.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER RECOGNIZES THAT THE  WOMEN'S  RIGHTS  MOVEMENT
 HAS  A  STRONG  TRADITION  IN THE STATE.  IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE
 STATE WAS AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS  MOVEMENT.  ON  JULY
 19,  1848, A GROUP OF ACTIVISTS INCLUDING ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, LUCRE-
 TIA MOTT AND MARY ANN M'CLINTOCK,  CONVENED  THE  FIRST  WOMEN'S  RIGHTS
 CONVENTION AT WESLEYAN CHAPEL IN SENECA FALLS. DURING THE CONVENTION, 68
 WOMEN  AND  32  MEN  SIGNED  THE DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS CALLING FOR A
 BROAD ARRAY OF RIGHTS FOR WOMEN, INCLUDING SUFFRAGE.  IN 1868, SUSAN  B.
 ANTHONY  HELPED TO FOUND THE AMERICAN EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION. IN 1890,
 UNDER HER LEADERSHIP AND THE LEADERSHIP OF ELIZABETH CADY  STANTON,  THE
 NATIONAL  AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION (NAWSA) WAS FORMED.  NAWSA
 WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN  SECURING  PASSAGE  OF  THE  19TH  AMENDMENT,  WHICH
 AMENDED  THE  CONSTITUTION  TO  GIVE  WOMEN  THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THE 19TH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7150  2
 
 AMENDMENT WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS ON JUNE 4, 1919, AND  WAS  RATIFIED  ON
 AUGUST  18,  1920.  SUSAN  B.  ANTHONY ALSO CAMPAIGNED FOR THE RIGHTS OF
 WOMEN TO OWN PROPERTY, TO KEEP THEIR OWN EARNINGS, AND TO  HAVE  CUSTODY
 OF THEIR CHILDREN. IN 1900, SHE PERSUADED THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER TO
 ADMIT  WOMEN.  IN  THE LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES, THE WOMEN'S
 MOVEMENT EXPANDED TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN SHAPING POLICIES ON  EDUCA-
 TION,  LEGAL  REFORM,  AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE.  THE LEGISLATURE
 RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE MANY NOTABLE WOMEN IN THE STATE WHO FOUGHT FOR
 WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE. IT IS THEREFORE THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO HAVE
 CREATED A PROGRAM THAT WILL SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY PROPERTIES AND SITES
 FOR INCLUSION INTO A WOMEN'S  RIGHTS  HISTORY  TRAIL.  BY  CREATING  A
 WOMEN'S  RIGHTS  HISTORY  TRAIL,  THE STATE WILL ENCOURAGE THE EDUCATION
 ABOUT AND AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE STATE  IN  THE
 WOMEN'S  RIGHTS  MOVEMENT  AND  THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HISTORY AS WELL AS
 ATTRACT VISITORS TO THE STATE AND ENHANCE  THE  STATE'S  TOURISM  TRADE.
 FURTHER  IT  IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE WOMEN'S
 RIGHTS HISTORY TRAIL IS ADEQUATELY SIGNED SO THAT TRAVELERS  MAY  FOLLOW
 THE TRAIL INDEPENDENTLY AND WITH EASE.
