  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 4, 2023, as Volunteer Firefighters' Appreciation
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
the firefighters throughout this great Empire State heroically  perform,
above  and  beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define
the task of fire protection; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 4, 2023, as  Volunteer
Firefighters'  Appreciation Day in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of International Firefighters' Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are nearly 100,000 volunteer firefighters in New York
State, according to the NYS  Office  of  Fire  Prevention  and  Control;
across  the  country  volunteer  firefighters  make up two-thirds of the
estimated 1.2 million firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ninety-five percent of volunteer firefighters are with fire
departments that protect a population of less than 25,000; more than 50%
of volunteers are located in small, rural  departments  that  protect  a
population of less than 2,500; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State
with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers  are  often
the  first  to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Volunteer  Firefighters'  Appreciation  Day,  this
Legislative Body  urges  all  New  Yorkers  to  remember  all  the  past
firefighters  who have heroically served our communities: those who have
died in service, as well as those who put their lives at risk to protect
our safety; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters dedicate their lives to the protection of life
and property; sometimes that dedication is  in  the  form  of  countless
hours  served  and  volunteered  over  many  years, in others it is many
selfless years working in the industry;  in  all  cases,  it  risks  the
ultimate sacrifice of a firefighter's life; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Firefighters' Day is a time where the world's
community  can  recognize  and honor the sacrifices firefighters make to
ensure their communities and environments are as safe as possible; it is
 
also a day in which current and past firefighters  can  be  thanked  for
their contributions; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 4, 2023, as  Volunteer
Firefighters'  Appreciation  Day  in  the  State  of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
