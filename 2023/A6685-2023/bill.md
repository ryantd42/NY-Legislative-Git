 budget  and  a  copy  of such certificate shall have been filed with the
 state comptroller, the chairman of the senate finance committee and  the
 chairman  of  the  assembly  ways and means committee provided, however,

 legislature or judiciary shall not require such certificate.
 
  §  4.  All  expenditures  and disbursements made against the appropri-
 ations in this act shall, upon final action by the legislature on appro-
 priation bills submitted by the governor pursuant to article VII of  the
 state  constitution  for  the support of government for the state fiscal

 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
