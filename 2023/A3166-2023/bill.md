 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to providing additional aid  to
  municipalities for the purposes of funding next generation 9-1-1 tech-
  nology and providing continuity of emergency dispatching services
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  the next generation 9-1-1 (commonly referred to as "NG 9-1-1")
 is a digital, internet protocol (IP)-based system that will replace  the
 analog 9-1-1 infrastructure that has long been in place in most parts of
 New  York. The success and reliability of 9-1-1 will be greatly improved
 with the implementation of NG 9-1-1, as it will enhance emergency number
 services to create a faster, more resilient system  that  allows  voice,
 photos,  videos  and text messages to flow seamlessly from the public to
 the 9-1-1 network. NG 9-1-1 will also  improve  the  ability  of  public
 safety  answering  points  (hereinafter  referred to as "PSAPs") to help
 manage call overload, natural disasters, and  transfer  of  9-1-1  calls
 based  on  caller  location  data.  Because  most  9-1-1  systems  were
 originally built using analog rather than  digital  technologies,  PSAPs
 across  New  York  (with  the  exception  of  New  York City) need to be
 upgraded to support NG 9-1-1. While the technology  to  implement  these
 new  IP-based  9-1-1  systems  is  available, the transition to NG 9-1-1
 involves much more than just new computer  hardware  and  software.  The
 legislature further finds and declares that many municipalities lack the
 funding  to  implement NG 9-1-1. The legislature also finds and declares
 that until counties have access to a dedicated revenue  stream  to  help
 pay  for  system  upgrades and new communications equipment, becoming NG
 9-1-1 capable will be out of reach for many areas. The legislature here-
 by authorizes the state to  help  counties  begin  developing  plans  to

 implement  NG  9-1-1, and enacts this legislation to provide appropriate
 funding to support such implementation.
  §  2.  Paragraph (a) of subdivision 5 of section 186-f of the tax law,
 as added by section 3 of part B of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2009,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  [forty-one  and  seven-tenths] THIRTY-TWO PERCENT of the revenues
 collected and received under this section into the state  general  fund;
 and
  §  3. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (g) of subdivision 6 of section 186-f of
 the tax law, paragraph (b) as amended by section 1 of part G of  chapter
 55 of the laws of 2022, paragraph (c) as amended by section 38 of part B
 of  chapter 56 of the laws of 2010 and paragraph (g) as added by section
 2 of part Q of chapter 55 of the laws of 2014, are amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (b)  The  sum  of  one  million  five hundred thousand dollars must be
 deposited into the New York state emergency services revolving loan fund
 annually; provided, however, that such sums shall not be  deposited  for
 state  fiscal  years two thousand eleven--two thousand twelve, two thou-
 sand twelve--two thousand thirteen, two thousand fourteen--two  thousand
 fifteen,  two  thousand  fifteen--two  thousand  sixteen,  two  thousand
 sixteen--two thousand seventeen, two  thousand  seventeen--two  thousand
 eighteen,  two  thousand  eighteen--two  thousand nineteen, two thousand
 nineteen--two thousand twenty, two thousand twenty--two  thousand  twen-
 ty-one, AND two thousand twenty-one--two thousand twenty-two[, two thou-
 sand  twenty-two--two  thousand  twenty-three,  and two thousand twenty-
 three--two thousand twenty-four];
  (c) Up to the sum of [seventy-five] ONE HUNDRED million dollars  annu-
 ally  may be used for the provision of grants or reimbursements to coun-
 ties for the development, consolidation, or operation of  public  safety
 communications  systems or networks designed to support statewide inter-
 operable communications for first responders, to be distributed pursuant
 to standards and guidelines issued  by  the  state.  Annual  grants  may
 consider  costs borne by a municipality related to the issuance of local
 public safety  communications  bonds  pursuant  to  section  twenty-four
 hundred  thirty-two of the public authorities law, when the municipality
 has qualified as an approved participant in  a  statewide  interoperable
 communications  system  under the standards and guidelines issued by the
 state, and maintains compliance with such standards and guidelines.  The
 grant  amount will be prescribed pursuant to an agreement with the muni-
 cipality, and may not exceed thirty percent of the annual cost borne  by
 the municipality in relation to such bonds;
  (g) The sum of [ten] TWENTY million dollars annually shall be used for
 the  provision of grants to counties for costs related to the operations
 of public safety dispatch centers, to be distributed pursuant to a  plan
 developed  by  the  commissioner  of  homeland  security  and  emergency
 services and approved by the director  of  the  budget.  Such  plan  may
 consider such factors as population density and emergency call volume.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
