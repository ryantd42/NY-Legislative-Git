  (1)  There is hereby created the "metropolitan transportation authori-

 sixteen  other  voting  members,  and  two non-voting and four alternate
 non-voting members, as described in subparagraph two of  this  paragraph

 member shall be, at the time of appointment, a resident of the county of
 Nassau, one a resident of the county of Suffolk, one a resident  of  the
 county  of  Westchester, one a resident of the county of Dutchess, one a
 resident of the county of Orange, one a resident of the county of Putnam
 and  one a resident of the county of Rockland, provided that the term of
 any member who is a resident of a county that  has  withdrawn  from  the
 metropolitan commuter transportation district pursuant to section twelve
 hundred  seventy-nine-b of this title shall terminate upon the effective
 date of such county's withdrawal from such district. Of the five  voting
 members,  other  than  the  chairman,  appointed by the governor without
 recommendation from any other person, three shall be,  at  the  time  of
 appointment,  residents of the city of New York and two shall be, at the
 time of appointment, residents of such city or of any of  the  aforemen-

 OF THESE FIVE VOTING MEMBERS, ONE SHALL BE SELECTED FROM A LIST  SUBMIT-

 notwithstanding the foregoing residency requirement,  one  of  the  five
 voting members appointed by the governor without recommendation from any
 other  person,  other  than the chairman, may be the director of the New
 York state division of the budget, and provided  further  that,  in  the
 event  of  such  appointment,  the  budget  director's membership in the
 authority shall be deemed ex-officio.  The  chairman  and  each  of  the
 members  shall  be  appointed for a term of six years, provided however,
 that the chairman first appointed shall serve for  a  term  ending  June
 thirtieth,  nineteen hundred eighty-one, provided that thirty days after
 the effective date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand nine which
 amended this subparagraph,  the  term  of  the  chairman  shall  expire;
 provided,  further,  that  such  chairman  may continue to discharge the
 duties of his or her office until the position of chairman is filled  by
 appointment  by  the  governor upon the advice and consent of the senate
 and the term of such new chairman shall terminate  June  thirtieth,  two
 thousand  fifteen. The sixteen other members first appointed shall serve
 for the following terms: The members from the  counties  of  Nassau  and
 Westchester  shall each serve for a term ending June thirtieth, nineteen
 hundred eighty-five; the members from the county of Suffolk and from the
 counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Rockland shall each serve for a
 term ending June thirtieth, nineteen  hundred  ninety-two;  two  of  the

  §  2.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to subparagraph 1 of paragraph (a) of  subdivision  1  of
 section  1263  of the public authorities law made by section one of this
 act shall not affect the expiration  of  such  paragraph  and  shall  be
 deemed to expire therewith.
