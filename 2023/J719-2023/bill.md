  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 10, 2023, as Mental Health Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 10, 2023, as
Mental Health Day in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of World Mental Health Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World Mental Health Day was observed for the first time in
1992 and continues to be the official day of commemoration  every  year;
it  was started as an annual activity of the World Federation for Mental
Health by the then Deputy Secretary General Richard Hunter; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Mental Health Day has become  the  largest  and  most
widely  promoted  education and advocacy program of the World Federation
for Mental Health; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every year,  approximately  42.5  million  American  adults
suffer from some mental illness, enduring conditions such as depression,
bipolar  disorder  or  schizophrenia;  these conditions lead to physical
harm or even death; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York, one  in  five  people  have  a  mental  health
disorder  with  8%  of  the  population  suffering  from  symptoms  of
depression; and
 
  WHEREAS, The objective of  World  Mental  Health  Day  is  to  raise
awareness  of  mental  health  issues  around  the world and to mobilize
efforts in support of mental health; the day provides an opportunity for
all stake-holders working on mental health issues to  talk  about  their
work  and  what needs to be done to make mental healthcare a reality for
people worldwide; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 10, 2023, as
Mental Health Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
