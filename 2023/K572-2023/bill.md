  CELEBRATING  the  life  of  Tina Turner, legendary
  performer and musical icon hailed as  the  Queen  of
  Rock and Roll
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute to those musical geniuses whose commitment and creative  talents
have  contributed  to the entertainment and cultural enrichment of their
community, the State of New York, the Nation and the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with  profound  sorrow  and  deep  regret  that  this
Legislative  Body  records  the  passing  of  Tina  Turner,  noting  the
significance of her inspired life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tina Turner, the dynamic rock and soul singer who rose from
humble beginnings and overcame much adversity to become one of the  most
popular artists of all time, died on Wednesday, May 24, 2023, at the age
of 83; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939,
into  a  sharecropping family in rural Tennessee; she began singing as a
teenager and, after moving to St. Louis, Missouri, immersed  herself  in
the local rhythm-and-blues scene; and
 
  WHEREAS,  She met Ike Turner at a performance by his band, the Kings
of Rhythm, in  1956,  and  soon  became  part  of  the  act;  she  began
performing  as Tina Turner, and her electric stage presence quickly made
her the centerpiece of the show; and
 
  WHEREAS, The ensemble, which toured  as  the  Ike  and  Tina  Turner
Revue,  was  renowned for its live performances, and in 1960, "A Fool in
Love" hit the pop charts; a string of hit  singles  followed,  including
"Nutbush  City Limits" and "Proud Mary," their 1971 cover of a Creedence
Clearwater Revival song, which reached No. 4 on the pop charts  and  won
them a Grammy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1976,  the  Ike and Tina Turner Revue performed as the
headliner at the Waldorf Astoria New York, before signing  a  television
deal with CBS for their own show; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ike and Tina Turner, who were married in 1962, found great
success during these New York shows, but  offstage  their  marriage  was
tumultuous and the couple divorced in 1978; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  era  of  rebuilding her career, Tina Turner began
playing in smaller venues,  including  The  Ritz-Carlton  New  York;  in
October of 1981, Rod Stewart attended one of her shows at the venue, and
after  seeing  her performance, asked her to join him on "Saturday Night
Live" for a televised performance of "Hot Legs"; and
 
  WHEREAS, After a series of guest appearances on the albums of  other
artists,  Tina  Turner  mounted  a  stunning  comeback  in 1984 when she
released her debut solo multiplatinum album, "Private Dancer"; it was  a
triumph,  both critically and commercially, selling more than 20 million
 
copies worldwide and winning three Grammy Awards,  including  record  of
the  year  and  best female vocal performance for "What's Love Got to Do
with It," the single which became her signature song; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Before  long,  Tina  Turner  became  a  global  superstar,
commanding MTV with her spiky wigs,  short  skirts,  and  famously  long
legs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tina Turner followed her musical success with a role in the
film  "Mad  Max  Beyond  Thunderdome"  (1985); her later albums included
"Break Every Rule" (1986), "Foreign Affair" (1989), and "Wildest Dreams"
(1996); her greatest-hits compilation "All the Best,"  was  released  in
2004; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  riveting  live  performer,  this  extraordinary  woman
continued touring into the 21st century and appeared on  other  artists'
albums,  notably  Herbie  Hancock's  "River: The Joni Letters" (2007), a
Grammy-winning tribute to Joni Mitchell; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, she wrote the autobiographies I,  Tina,  which
was  written in 1986 and adapted in 1993 as the film "What's Love Got to
Do with It," and My Love Story (2018), as well as  the  self-help  book,
Happiness  Becomes  You:  A Guide to Changing Your Life for Good (2020);
and
 
  WHEREAS, Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the  Rock  and  Roll
Hall of Fame in 1991; 30 years later, in 2021, she was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo performer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  receiving a Kennedy Center Honor (2005),
Tina Turner earned a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2018; that
same year, "Tina," a jukebox  musical  based  on  her  life,  opened  in
London's  West  End;  the  musical  debuted  on Broadway in 2019, and is
currently on tour nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tina Turner and the love of  her  life,  Erwin  Bach,  were
united in marriage in 2013, after 27 years together; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tina  Turner's undeniable talent earned her acclaim as the
Queen of Rock and Roll, while her resiliency made her a  hero  to  women
everywhere;  when  she  sang  of  pain and heartache in her husky, raspy
voice, every word rang true; and
 
  WHEREAS, A raw, powerful, and truly unstoppable woman,  Tina  Turner
was unapologetically herself, speaking and singing her truth through joy
and  pain,  triumph,  and  tragedy;  through her music and her boundless
passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around  the  world  and
will forever remain a star whose light will never fade; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tina  Turner was nothing less than a giant; her dedication
to her music leaves an indelible legacy of inspiration which  will  long
endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to her
family, friends and countless fans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate  the  life  of  Tina  Turner,  and  to  express  its  deepest
condolences to her family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Tina Turner.
