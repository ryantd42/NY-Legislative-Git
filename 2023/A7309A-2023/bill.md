 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the

 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  setting the increase to the overtime ceiling as a fixed percentage
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (c) of subdivision  24  of  section  501  of  the
 retirement  and  social  security  law, as amended by chapter 368 of the
 laws of 2017, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) [(i)] The "overtime ceiling" shall mean fifteen  thousand  dollars
 per  annum on January first, two thousand ten, and shall be increased by
 three percent each year thereafter, provided, however, that [for]:
  (I) FOR members who first become members of the  New  York  state  and
 local employees' retirement system on or after April first, two thousand
 twelve, "overtime ceiling" shall mean fifteen thousand dollars per annum
 on  April  first,  two thousand twelve, and shall be increased each year
 thereafter by a percentage to be determined annually by reference to the
 consumer price index (all urban consumers, CPI-U, U.S. city average, all
 items, 1982-84=100), published by the  United  States  bureau  of  labor
 statistics,  for  each  applicable  calendar year. Said percentage shall
 equal the annual inflation  as  determined  from  the  increase  in  the
 consumer price index in the one year period ending on the December thir-
 ty-first  preceding  the  overtime  ceiling  adjustment effective on the
 ensuing April first.
  (ii) Commencing January first, two thousand eighteen,  and  each  year
 thereafter,  the  overtime  ceiling  percentage shall be increased by an
 amount equal to the annual inflation as determined from the increase  in
 the  consumer price index in the one year period ending on the September
 thirtieth prior to the overtime  ceiling  adjustment  effective  on  the
 ensuing January first.

 STATE  AND  LOCAL  EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON OR AFTER APRIL FIRST,

  (c) The "overtime ceiling" shall mean  fifteen  thousand  dollars  per

  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  change the overtime ceiling percentage increase for
 Tier 6 members in the New York State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  (NYSLERS)  to  the  greater  of  three  percent  or  the  annual
 inflation, beginning January 1, 2024. Under current law, the ceiling was
 set at $15,000 at the inception of Tier 6 and is increased  annually  by
 the inflation rate.
  Insofar  as  this  bill affects the NYSLERS, pursuant to Section 25 of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law, the  increased  costs  would  be
 borne  entirely  by  the State of New York and would require an itemized
 appropriation sufficient to pay the cost of the provision. If this  bill
 is  enacted  during  the  2023  legislative session, the increase in the
 present value of benefits would be approximately $204 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 A. 7309  3
 
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $75 million as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in the NYSLERS is 0.05% of billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $6.2  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $9.0 million to local participating employers in the fiscal year  ending
 March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing  cycles  with changes in the billing rate and salary of the affected
 members.
  These estimated costs are based on 238,007 affected  Tier  6  members,
 with annual salary of approximately $10 billion as of March 31, 2022.
