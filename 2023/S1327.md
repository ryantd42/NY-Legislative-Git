 of  the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 42 USC 1973gg-7 shall be

 provisions  of  this  article.  A  voter  whose registration is accepted
 pursuant to the provisions of  this  paragraph  shall  be  permitted  to

 S. 1327  5
 
 failure to complete the voter registration application appearing on such
 affidavit envelope shall not otherwise invalidate the affidavit ballot.
  6.  A  person  who  willfully  makes a material false statement in any
 application for registration and enrollment and/or transfer of registra-
 tion and enrollment or special enrollment  by  mail,  or  who  knowingly
 makes a false affirmation, or who offers or attempts to offer any appli-
 cation  for  registration and enrollment or transfer of registration and
 enrollment or special enrollment knowing that the applicant is not qual-
 ified to register or enroll, or transfer [his or her] THEIR registration
 and enrollment or to specially enroll, shall be  guilty  of  a  class  E
 felony.
  7. Each county board of elections shall deliver a sufficient number of
 such uniform statewide application forms to each local post office with-
 in  its  county  and keep such post office so supplied, with the request
 that the postmaster thereof make them available to the  public  for  its
 use in participating in the electoral process.
  8. Upon its receipt by the county board of elections, each application
 form  shall  be  reviewed and examined by such board. If the application
 shall contain substantially all the required information indicating that
 the applicant is legally qualified to register and/or enroll  as  stated
 in  [his  or her] THEIR application, the county board of elections shall
 transfer all information on such application to the  appropriate  regis-
 tration  records.  If requested by any member of the board, the applica-
 tion form of any voter, or group of voters, must be reviewed  and  exam-
 ined  by  two  such  board  members  or  two  employees  of  the  board
 representing different political  parties.  Such  members  or  employees
 shall  place  their  initials  or  other  identifying information on the
 registration poll record of such voter or on a computer  generated  list
 of such registrations. Such lists shall be preserved in the same manner,
 and  for the same time, as such registration poll records. If the appli-
 cation indicates that the voter does not  have  a  driver's  license  or
 department  of  motor  vehicles  non-driver  photo ID number or a social
 security number, the state board of elections  shall,  upon  the  trans-
 mission of voter information to the statewide voter registration list as
 required  by  section  5-614 of this article, assign such voter a unique
 identifier.
  9.  The county board of elections shall, [promptly] AS SOON AS PRACTI-
 CABLE and in any event, not later than  [twenty-one]  SEVEN  days  after
 receipt  by it of the application, verify the identity of the applicant.
 In order to do so, the county  board  of  elections  shall  utilize  the
 information provided in the application and shall attempt to verify such
 information  with  the  information  provided by the department of motor
 vehicles, social security administration and any other lawful  available
 information source. If the county board of elections is unable to verify
 the  identity  of  the  applicant  within [twenty-one] SEVEN days of the
 receipt of the application, it shall immediately take steps  to  confirm
 that  the  information provided by the applicant was accurately utilized
 by such county board of elections, was accurately  verified  with  other
 information  sources and that no data entry error, or other similar type
 of error, occurred. Following completion of  the  preceding  steps,  the
 county board of elections shall mail (a) a notice of its approval, (b) a
 notice  of its approval which includes an indication that such board has
 not yet been able to verify the identity of the applicant and a  request
 for  more information so that such verification may be completed, or (c)
 a notice of its rejection of the application to the applicant in a  form
 approved  by  the state board of elections. Notices of approval, notices
 S. 1327  6
 
 of approval with requests for more information or notices  of  rejection
 shall be sent by nonforwardable first class or return postage guaranteed
 mail on which is endorsed such language designated by the state board of
 elections  to  ensure  postal  authorities  do not forward such mail but
 return it to the board of elections with forwarding information, when it
 cannot be delivered as addressed and which contains a request  that  any
 such  mail  received  for persons not residing at the address be dropped
 back in the mail. The  voter's  registration  and  enrollment  shall  be
 complete upon receipt of the application by the appropriate county board
 of  elections.  The  failure of a county board of elections to verify an
 applicant's identity shall not be the  basis  for  the  rejection  of  a
 voter's  application,  provided, however, that such verification failure
 shall be the basis for requiring county board of elections to  take  the
 additional verification steps provided by this chapter. The notice shall
 also advise the registrant of the date when [his] THEIR registration and
 enrollment is effective, of the date and the hours of the next regularly
 scheduled primary or general election in which [he] SUCH REGISTRANT will
 be  eligible  to  vote,  of  the  location  of  the polling place of the
 election district in which [he] SUCH REGISTRANT is or will be  a  quali-
 fied voter, whether such polling place is accessible to physically hand-
 icapped  voters,  an  indication  that  physically handicapped voters or
 voters who are ill or voters who will be out of the city  or  county  on
 the  day  of  the  primary  or  general election, may obtain an absentee
 ballot and the phone number to call for  absentee  ballot  applications,
 the  phone  numbers  to  call  for location of polling places, to obtain
 registration forms and the phone number to call  to  indicate  that  the
 voter is willing to serve on election day as an inspector, poll clerk or
 interpreter. The notice of approval, notice of approval with request for
 more  information or notice of rejection shall also advise the applicant
 to notify the board of elections if there is any inaccuracy. The form of
 such mail notification  shall  be  prescribed  by  the  state  board  of
 elections  and  shall contain such other information and instructions as
 it may reasonably require to carry out the purposes of this section. The
 request for more information shall inform the voter that "THE FAILURE TO
 CONTACT THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS  AND  CORRECT  ANY  INACCURACIES  IN  THE
 APPLICATION  OR PROVIDE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT IN A
 REQUEST FOR IDENTIFICATION AT THE POLLS IN ORDER TO CAST  A  VOTE  ON  A
 VOTING  MACHINE."  If  such notice is returned undelivered without a new
 address, the board shall forthwith send such  applicant  a  confirmation
 notice  pursuant  to the provisions of section 5-712 of this article and
 place such applicant in inactive status. The state  board  of  elections
 shall  prepare uniform notices by this section as provided for in subdi-
 vision eight of section 3-102 of this chapter.
  10.  If the board of elections has been unable to verify the  identity
 of  the  applicant  within forty-five days of the application, the board
 shall mail a second request for more information to the applicant.  This
 notice  shall inform the voter that "THE FAILURE TO CONTACT THE BOARD OF
 ELECTIONS AND CORRECT ANY INACCURACIES IN  THE  APPLICATION  OR  PROVIDE
 REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT IN A REQUEST FOR IDENTIFICA-
 TION  AT  THE POLLS IN ORDER TO CAST A VOTE ON A VOTING MACHINE." If the
 board of elections remains unable to verify the identity of the voter it
 shall so indicate with a notation next to the voter's name in the regis-
 tration list. Such a voter may provide information to assist the  county
 board  to  verify [his or her] THEIR identity at any time and such nota-
 tion shall be removed by the board of elections upon such verification.
 S. 1327  7
 
  11. If the county board of elections suspects or believes that for any
 reason the applicant is not entitled to registration and enrollment,  it
 shall make inquiry in reference thereto. If the board of elections shall
 find  that  the  applicant  is not qualified to register and enroll, the
 application  shall  be  rejected  and  the  applicant  notified  of such
 rejection and the reason therefor, no later than [ten] SEVEN days before
 the day of the first primary or  general  election  occurring  at  least
 [twenty-five] TEN days after the filing of the application.
  12.  Whenever  the  county board of elections is not satisfied from an
 examination of an application for registration and enrollment, or  after
 its initial inquiry, that the applicant is entitled to such registration
 or  enrollment,  it  may  order  an investigation through any officer or
 employee of the state or county  board  of  elections,  police  officer,
 sheriff or deputy sheriff.
  13.  An affidavit or a signed statement by any officer or employee of
 the state or county board of elections or any police officer, sheriff or
 deputy sheriff, that such person visited the  premises  claimed  by  the
 applicant  as [his or her] THEIR residence and interrogated an incarcer-
 ated individual, house-dweller, keeper, caretaker, owner, proprietor  or
 landlord  thereof or therein as to such applicant's residence therein or
 thereat, and that [he or she was] THEY WERE informed by one or more such
 persons, naming them, that they knew  the  persons  residing  upon  such
 premises and that the applicant did not reside upon such premises as set
 forth  in  [his or her] THEIR application, shall be sufficient authority
 for a determination by the board that the applicant is not  entitled  to
 registration  or  enrollment;  but this provision shall not preclude the
 board from making such other  determination,  as  the  result  of  other
 inquiry, as it may deem appropriate.
  14.  Notwithstanding the entry by the county board of elections on the
 registration poll record of the information contained on an  application
 form prescribed by this section, such entry shall not preclude the coun-
 ty  board of elections from subsequently rejecting the application if it
 is not satisfied that the applicant is entitled to register  and  enroll
 as  provided by this section, provided that the applicant is notified of
 such rejection and reasons therefor  no  later  than  [ten]  SEVEN  days
 before  the  day  of  the first primary or general election occurring at
 least [twenty-five] TEN days after the filing of such application form.
  15. a. The county board of elections shall keep a record  of  applica-
 tions  for  registration  as  they  are  received and at least once each
 month, shall, upon request of the chairman of a political party  in  the
 county, give such chairman a complete list of the persons whose applica-
 tions were approved together with their addresses and telephone numbers,
 and their election and assembly districts or wards, if any.
  b.  Not  more than four times a year, on dates determined by the state
 board of elections, the county board of  elections  shall  send  to  the
 chairman  of  each  political party in the county a complete list of the
 persons whose applications were approved together with their  addresses,
 their  election  and  assembly  districts  or wards, if any, their party
 enrollments and an indication of whether such persons  are  eligible  to
 vote in the primary elections to be held in that calendar year. Not more
 than  twice  a  year, in even numbered years, on dates determined by the
 state board of elections, the county board of  elections  shall  send  a
 copy  of  such list to the state board of elections. In counties of over
 one hundred thousand population, each such list shall be, and  in  other
 counties  each such list may be, cumulative and include the names of all
 such persons whose names do not appear in the  annual  enrollment  lists
 S. 1327  8
 
 last  published  by such board of elections, together with an indication
 of which such names did not appear on the previous list. Such lists  may
 also  include  the  names  of those persons whose names do appear in the
 annual enrollment lists. Such lists shall be arranged in the same manner
 as the annual enrollment lists. Additional copies of such lists shall be
 available  to  the public at a charge not exceeding the cost of publica-
 tion or reproduction.

 that [he or she has] THEY HAVE duly registered to vote, the  address  in
 such  election district from which [he or she] THEY registered, that [he
 or she remains] THEY REMAIN a duly  qualified  voter  in  such  election
 district, that [his or her] THEIR registration poll record appears to be
 lost  or  misplaced  or that [his or her] THEIR name and/or [his or her]
 THEIR signature was omitted from  the  computer  generated  registration

 be  printed  on an envelope of the size and quality used for an absentee
 ballot envelope, and shall contain an acknowledgment  that  the  affiant
 understands  that any false statement made therein is perjury punishable
 according to law. Such form prescribed by the state board  of  elections

 THEIR name in such list. The voter shall then, without further  inquiry,
 be  permitted  to vote an affidavit ballot provided for by this chapter.

 her]  THEIR affidavit, and the envelope sealed and returned to the board
 of elections in the manner provided by this chapter for protested  offi-
 cial ballots, including a statement of the number of such ballots.

 previous  general  election,  such  voter must so register and enroll in
 such party not later than [twenty-five] TEN days  before  such  primary;
