 Introduced by M. of A. JOYNER -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Governmental Operations
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the executive law, the public authorities law and the
  county law, in relation to requiring certain documents and forms to be
  provided in multiple languages

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature hereby
 finds that as New York's immigrant population continues to grow, inabil-
 ity to access documents translated into languages that community members
 read and lack of interpretation of  government  services  and  resources
 into  languages  that  community members speak are major barriers to the
 advancement of the  state's  immigrant  population.  However,  currently
 language  access  in  New  York  is  based  on  an Executive Order which
 mandates translation into the  same  ten  languages  across  the  entire
 state, failing to account for significant differences in immigrant popu-
 lations across New York's regions. Translation is also only mandatory in
 a handful of executive specific agencies, instead of across all subdivi-
 sions  of state and county government. The legislature believes language
 access improves the lives of immigrants by increasing opportunities  for
 employment,  business  ownership, and other vital services, while making
 staff time at state agencies and authorities more efficient,  benefiting
 all of New York.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new article 49-C to read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 49-C
  LANGUAGE ACCESS
 SECTION 996. LANGUAGE ACCESS.
  996-A. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.
  §  996.  LANGUAGE  ACCESS.  1.  EACH STATE AGENCY THAT PROVIDES DIRECT
 PUBLIC SERVICES SHALL TRANSLATE  VITAL  DOCUMENTS,  INCLUDING  ESSENTIAL

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
