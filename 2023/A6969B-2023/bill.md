 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation  to  the
  regulation of ingredients in personal care products and cosmetics
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "beauty justice act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent.  Thousands of chemicals are used
 in  cosmetics  and  personal  care products. Some of these chemicals are
 associated with asthma, allergies, hormone disruption,  neurodevelopmen-
 tal  problems,  infertility,  even cancer. Exposure to personal care and
 cosmetic products typically begins in infancy,  with  products  such  as
 baby  shampoo,  lotion, and diaper cream, and continues throughout their
 lifespan.  According to the Environmental Working  Group,  "on  average,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6969--B  2
 
 women  use  12  personal care products a day, exposing themselves to 168
 chemical ingredients. Men use six,  exposing  themselves  to  85  unique
 chemicals."
  Further,  The  National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted an eight-
 year study of over  46,000  women  who  used  permanent  hair  dyes  and
 straighteners.  They  found  that women of color who regularly used dyes
 and straighteners had a 45 percent  higher  breast  cancer  risk.  White
 women faced a 7 percent higher breast cancer risk.
  European  Union  countries  prohibit  (with few exceptions) substances
 classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic,  or  toxic  for  reproduction  in
 cosmetic  products. The Canadian government regularly updates a Cosmetic
 Ingredient Hotlist that includes hundreds of chemicals and  contaminants
 prohibited  and restricted from cosmetics, such as formaldehyde, triclo-
 san, and more. Furthermore, over 40 countries including Japan, Cambodia,
 and Vietnam, have stricter restrictions on chemicals  in  personal  care
 products than does the United States.
  Moreover,  regarding  the  safety  of using personal care products,
 the federal Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act  of  2022  is  the
 first  federal  law to significantly update the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
 Act. However, the Act fails to meaningfully restrict the use of  harmful
 chemicals  in  personal  care/cosmetic  products,  and explicitly grants
 states the ability to enact such restrictions. For example, it failed to
 ban coal tar, a well known carcinogen.
  Therefore, the  legislature  finds  and  declares  that  federal
 restrictions of harmful chemicals in personal care and cosmetic products
 are  inadequate  to educate and protect consumers and salon workers, and
 that  it  shall  be the policy of the state to restrict  chemicals  that
 may  harm  the health of New Yorkers during production, use, or disposal
 of personal care products and cosmetic products.
  § 3. Article 37 of the environmental conservation law  is  amended  by
 adding a new title 12 to read as follows:

 § 37-1205. IDENTIFICATION OF SAFER ALTERNATIVES.
  BY  JANUARY  FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SEVEN,  THE  DEPARTMENT, IN

 CLASSES THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SAME OR SIMILAR FUNCTION IN  PERSONAL  CARE
 PRODUCTS  AND  COSMETIC  PRODUCTS  AS  THE CHEMICALS OR CHEMICAL CLASSES
 LISTED IN SECTION 37-1201 OF THIS TITLE AND THAT CAN  IMPACT  VULNERABLE
 POPULATIONS.  IN  DOING  SO  THEY  MAY CONSULT WITH THE NEW YORK STATE
 POLLUTION PREVENTION INSTITUTE AND THE  INTERSTATE  CHEMICALS  CLEARING-
 HOUSE.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL MAKE SUCH INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.
 § 37-1207. REGULATIONS.

 inconsistent  with  any federal law or regulation, that shall not affect
 the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of this act, or  of
 any  other  application of any provision of this act, which can be given
 effect without that provision or  application;  and  to  that  end,  the
