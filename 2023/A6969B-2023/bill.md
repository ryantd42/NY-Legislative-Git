 Introduced  by M. of A. GLICK -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation  to  the
  regulation of ingredients in personal care products and cosmetics
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "safe personal care and cosmetics act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent.  Thousands of chemicals are used
 in  cosmetics  and  personal  care products. Some of these chemicals are
 associated with asthma, allergies, hormone disruption,  neurodevelopmen-
 tal  problems,  infertility,  even cancer. Exposure to personal care and
 cosmetic products typically begins in infancy,  with  products  such  as
 baby  shampoo,  lotion, and diaper cream, and continues throughout their
 lifespan.  According to the Environmental Working  Group,  "on  average,
 women  use  12  personal care products a day, exposing themselves to 168
 chemical ingredients. Men use six,  exposing  themselves  to  85  unique
 chemicals."
  Further,  The  National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted an eight-
 year study of over  46,000  women  who  used  permanent  hair  dyes  and
 straighteners.  They  found  that women of color who regularly used dyes
 and straighteners had a 45 percent  higher  breast  cancer  risk.  White
 women faced a 7 percent higher breast cancer risk.
  European  Union  countries  prohibit  (with few exceptions) substances
 classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic,  or  toxic  for  reproduction  in
 cosmetic  products. The Canadian government regularly updates a Cosmetic
 Ingredient Hotlist that includes hundreds of chemicals and  contaminants
 prohibited  and restricted from cosmetics, such as formaldehyde, triclo-
 san, and more. Furthermore, over 40 countries including Japan, Cambodia,
 and Vietnam, have stricter restrictions on chemicals  in  personal  care
 products than does the United States.

  Moreover,  regarding  the  safety  of using personal care products,
 the federal Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act  of  2022  is  the
 first  federal  law to significantly update the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
 Act. However, the Act fails to meaningfully restrict the use of  harmful
 chemicals  in  personal  care/cosmetic  products,  and explicitly grants
 states the ability to enact such restrictions. For example, it failed to
 ban coal tar, a well known carcinogen.
  Therefore, the  legislature  finds  and  declares  that  federal
 restrictions of harmful chemicals in personal care and cosmetic products
 are  inadequate  to educate and protect consumers and salon workers, and
 that  it  shall  be the policy of the state to restrict  chemicals  that
 may  harm  the health of New Yorkers during production, use, or disposal
 of personal care products and cosmetic products.
  § 3. Article 37 of the environmental conservation law  is  amended  by
 adding a new title 11 to read as follows:
