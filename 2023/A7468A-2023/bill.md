 EST, TO THE EXTENT THE POLICE SERVICE PURCHASED WITH SUCH  AMOUNTS  DOES

 GRAPH,  WHEN  ADDED TO A MEMBER'S CURRENT SERVICE CREDIT, RENDERS HIM OR

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 A. 7468  3
 
  This  bill  would  allow up to two years of service credit for service
 rendered as a  deputy  sheriff,  county  corrections  officer  or  state
 corrections officer engaged directly in law enforcement activities to be
 creditable  to  State  Police  officers.  State Police officers would be
 eligible  to  purchase  three  months  of  service credit for every five
 months of such previous deputy sheriff  or  correction  officer  service
 rendered.  The  officers  must have at least seventeen years of credited
 service and would be required to make a  payment  of  three  percent  of
 their  most  recent  compensation  per year of additional service credit
 granted by this bill. Currently, such service is not creditable in a New
 York State and Local Police and Fire twenty-year police retirement plan.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023  legislative  session,  it  is
 estimated  that  the past service cost will average approximately 22% of
 an affected officer's compensation for each year of  additional  service
 credit  that is purchased. This cost will be borne entirely by the State
 of New York.
  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  plan  qualification  issues:  granting
 service  credit  towards  retirement  in  a 20-year plan in the New York
 State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) for employ-
 ment that was not rendered in the NYSLPFRS could jeopardize the  Retire-
 ment  System's governmental plan status and its exemption from Employees
 Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). This development could result in
 the loss of qualified status, which would mean the loss of tax benefits.
 This result would substantially impair the System's value  to  our  more
 than one million participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not  harm the qualification status of the Retirement System. It is esti-
 mated that the costs to obtain such a ruling would be  $38,000  for  the
 services of the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
