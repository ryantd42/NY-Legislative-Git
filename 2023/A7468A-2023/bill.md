 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  granting members or officers of the state police credit for service as
  a  deputy  sheriff,  county  corrections officer, or state corrections
  officer
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision c of section 381-b of the retirement and social
 security law is amended by adding a new paragraph 3 to read as follows:
  (3)  (I)  DEPUTY  SHERIFF,  COUNTY  CORRECTIONS,  OR STATE CORRECTIONS
 SERVICE. UPON COMPLETION OF MORE THAN SEVENTEEN YEARS OF  SERVICE,  EACH
 SUCH  MEMBER  WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY CREDITED WITH SERVICE CREDIT IN THE NEW
 YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM AS A  DEPUTY  SHERIFF,
 COUNTY  CORRECTIONS  OFFICER,  OR  MEMBER  IN THE UNIFORMED PERSONNEL IN
 INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND
 COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION I OF SECTION EIGHTY-NINE
 OF THIS CHAPTER AND WHO WAS ENGAGED DIRECTLY IN LAW  ENFORCEMENT  ACTIV-
 ITIES  WHILE  PERFORMING  SUCH  SERVICES  SHALL  RECEIVE THREE MONTHS OF
 SERVICE CREDIT FOR EACH SUCH FIVE MONTHS OF PREVIOUS SERVICE,  UP  TO  A
 TOTAL OF NO GREATER THAN TWO YEARS OF PREVIOUS SERVICE CREDIT.
  (II) TO OBTAIN SUCH CREDIT, A MEMBER SHALL PAY SUCH RETIREMENT SYSTEM,
 FOR DEPOSIT IN THE FUND USED TO ACCUMULATE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS, A SUM
 EQUAL  TO  THE  PRODUCT  OF  THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF POLICE SERVICE BEING
 CLAIMED AND THREE PERCENT OF SUCH MEMBER'S  COMPENSATION  EARNED  DURING
 THE  TWELVE  MONTHS  OF  CREDITED SERVICE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE
 THAT THE MEMBER MADE APPLICATION FOR CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. IF

 A. 7468--A  2
 
 PAY SUCH MEMBER COSTS BY PAYROLL DEDUCTION FOR A PERIOD WHICH SHALL  NOT
 EXCEED THE TIME PERIOD OF POLICE SERVICE TO BE CREDITED PURSUANT TO THIS
 SECTION.  IN  THE  EVENT THE MEMBER LEAVES THE EMPLOYER PAYROLL PRIOR TO
 COMPLETION  OF PAYMENT, SUCH MEMBER SHALL FORWARD ALL REMAINING REQUIRED
 PAYMENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM  PRIOR  TO  THE  EFFECTIVE
 DATE  OF RETIREMENT. IF THE FULL AMOUNT OF SUCH MEMBER COSTS IS NOT PAID
 TO THE APPROPRIATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM PRIOR TO THE  MEMBER'S  RETIREMENT,
 THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE CREDITED SHALL BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT
 OF THE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.
  (III)  TO  BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR POLICE SERVICE UNDER THIS
 PARAGRAPH, A MEMBER MUST MAKE APPLICATION FOR  SUCH  CREDIT  BEFORE  THE
 EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT.
  (IV) NO MEMBER SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR POLICE SERVICES
 UNDER  THIS  PARAGRAPH WHO RECEIVED CREDIT UNDER SECTION ONE THOUSAND OF
 THIS CHAPTER.
  (V) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, IN THE EVENT OF  DEATH
 PRIOR  TO  RETIREMENT,  AMOUNTS  PAID  BY THE MEMBER FOR THE PURCHASE OF
 POLICE SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE REFUNDED, WITH
 INTEREST, TO THE EXTENT THE POLICE SERVICE PURCHASED WITH  SUCH  AMOUNTS
 DOES  NOT  PRODUCE  A GREATER DEATH BENEFIT THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE
 HAD THE MEMBER NOT PURCHASED SUCH CREDIT.
  (VI) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION  OF  LAW,  IN  THE  EVENT  OF
 RETIREMENT,  AMOUNTS  PAID  BY  THE  MEMBER  FOR  THE PURCHASE OF POLICE
 SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE REFUNDED,  WITH  INTER-
 EST,  TO  THE EXTENT THE POLICE SERVICE PURCHASED WITH SUCH AMOUNTS DOES
 NOT PRODUCE A GREATER RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN  PAYABLE
 HAD THE MEMBER NOT PURCHASED SUCH CREDIT.
  (VII)  IN  THE EVENT THE SERVICE CREDIT GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS PARA-
 GRAPH, WHEN ADDED TO A MEMBER'S CURRENT  SERVICE  CREDIT,  RENDERS  SUCH
 MEMBER  ELIGIBLE  FOR  SERVICE  RETIREMENT,  SUCH MEMBER SHALL BE DEEMED
 ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH SERVICE RETIREMENT AND MAY ELECT TO RETIRE  UNDER  THE
 RULES SET FORTH BY THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
  §  2. All costs for service credited to a member pursuant to paragraph
 3 of subdivision c of section 381-b of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law, as added by section one of this act, other than the member costs
 set forth in subparagraph (ii) of such paragraph, shall be paid  by  the
 state of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  New  York State Police covered under Section
 381-b of the Retirement  and  Social  Security  Law  (RSSL)  to  receive
 service credit for time rendered as a deputy sheriff, county corrections
 officer,  or member in the uniformed personnel in institutions under the
 jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and Community  Supervision
 and  who were engaged directly in law enforcement activities. Currently,
 such service is not creditable in any service-based retirement  plan  in
 the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System. A member
 may  obtain  three months of §381-b service credit for every five months
 such NYSLERS service credit, not  to  exceed  two  years  of  additional
 service  credit.  Members must have at least seventeen years of credited
 service under §381-b (not including the NYSLERS service)  and  would  be
 required to make a payment of three percent of their most recent compen-
 sation per year of additional service credit granted by this bill.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it is
 estimated that the past service cost will average approximately  27%  of
 an affected member's most recent 12 months of compensation for each year
 A. 7468--A  3
 
 of  additional  service  that  is  credited, which will be billed to the
 State  of  New  York  annually  based  on  those  benefiting  from  this
 provision.
  Further,  we  anticipate  additional administrative costs to implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
