 paragraph  shall  be  prorated according to the period such taxpayer was
 subject to tax. Provided, however, that this paragraph shall  not  apply

 [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX.  For the  taxable  years  specified  in  the
 preceding sentence, the tax imposed by subdivision one of section 11-603
 of this subchapter shall be, in the case of each taxpayer, determined as
 specified  in  paragraph  A of this subdivision, provided, however, that
 the provisions of paragraphs G and H of this subdivision shall apply for
 purposes of the computation under clause three of  subparagraph  (a)  of
 such paragraph A.
