 PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS  SHALL  BE  INCLUDED  IN THE CAPITATION PAYMENTS FOR

 PROVIDED THAT THE MANAGED CARE  PROVIDER  PAYS  FOR  PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS

 IPANT,  REIMBURSEMENT  MAY  BE  DENIED  UNLESS  PRIOR  AUTHORIZATION  IS
 OBTAINED, UNLESS NO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED UNDER THIS  SECTION.
 WHEN  A  PRESCRIBER  PRESCRIBES  A  PREFERRED DRUG FOR A PARTICIPANT, NO
 PRIOR  AUTHORIZATION  SHALL  BE REQUIRED FOR REIMBURSEMENT, UNLESS PRIOR
 AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED UNDER THE CLINICAL DRUG REVIEW PROGRAM.
  (C) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR SYSTEMS
 THAT, AT A MINIMUM, ENSURE THAT  SYSTEMS  PROVIDE  SUFFICIENT  TECHNICAL
 SUPPORT AND TIMELY RESPONSES TO CONSUMERS, PRESCRIBERS AND PHARMACISTS.
  (D)  THE  COMMISSIONER SHALL ADOPT CRITERIA FOR QUALIFIED PRESCRIPTION
 DRUG SYSTEMS AFTER CONSIDERING  RECOMMENDATIONS  AND  COMMENTS  RECEIVED
 FROM  PRESCRIBERS,  PHARMACISTS, PARTICIPANTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS REPRES-
 ENTING THEM.
  (E) THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER SHALL DEVELOP ITS  PREFERRED  DRUG  LIST
 BASED  INITIALLY ON AN EVALUATION OF THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY,
 AND PATIENT OUTCOMES, FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERATION OF  THE  COST-EFFECTIVE-
 NESS  OF THE DRUGS. IN EACH THERAPEUTIC CLASS, THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER
 SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS ONE DRUG  THAT  IS  SIGNIFICANTLY  MORE
 CLINICALLY  EFFECTIVE  AND  SAFE, AND THAT DRUG SHALL BE INCLUDED ON THE
 PREFERRED DRUG LIST WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF COST. IF, AMONG TWO OR MORE
 DRUGS IN A THERAPEUTIC CLASS, THE DIFFERENCE IN  CLINICAL  EFFECTIVENESS
 AND  SAFETY  IS  NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT, THEN COST-EFFECTIVENESS MAY
 ALSO BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHICH DRUG OR DRUGS SHALL BE  INCLUDED
 ON THE PREFERRED DRUG LIST.
  4. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. (A) A QUALIFIED PRESCRIPTION DRUG SYSTEM SHALL
 MAKE AVAILABLE A TWENTY-FOUR HOUR PER DAY, SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK TELEPHONE
 CALL  CENTER  THAT  INCLUDES  A  TOLLFREE  TELEPHONE  LINE AND DEDICATED
 FACSIMILE LINE TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. THE  CALL
 CENTER  SHALL  INCLUDE  QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO SHALL BE
 AVAILABLE TO CONSULT WITH PRESCRIBERS CONCERNING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT
 ARE NON-PREFERRED DRUGS. A PRESCRIBER SEEKING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION  SHALL
 CONSULT  WITH  THE  PROGRAM  CALL  LINE TO REASONABLY PRESENT HIS OR HER
 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRESCRIPTION  AND  GIVE  THE  PROGRAM'S  QUALIFIED
 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND.
  (B)  WHEN  A PATIENT'S HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PRESCRIBES A NON-PREFERRED
 DRUG, THE PRESCRIBER SHALL CONSULT WITH THE SYSTEM TO  CONFIRM  THAT  IN
 HIS  OR  HER  REASONABLE  PROFESSIONAL  JUDGMENT, THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL
 CONDITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF  THE  NON-PRE-
 FERRED DRUG. SUCH CRITERIA SHALL INCLUDE:
  (I) THE PREFERRED DRUG HAS BEEN TRIED BY THE PATIENT AND HAS FAILED TO
 PRODUCE THE DESIRED HEALTH OUTCOMES;
  (II)  THE  PATIENT  HAS  TRIED  THE PREFERRED DRUG AND HAS EXPERIENCED
 UNACCEPTABLE SIDE EFFECTS;
  (III) THE PATIENT HAS BEEN STABILIZED  ON  A  NON-PREFERRED  DRUG  AND
 TRANSITION TO THE PREFERRED DRUG WOULD BE MEDICALLY CONTRAINDICATED; OR
  (IV)  OTHER CLINICAL INDICATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMISSIONER OR THE
 MANAGED CARE PROVIDER FOR THE PATIENT'S USE OF THE  NON-PREFERRED  DRUG,
 WHICH  SHALL INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF SPECIAL POPU-
 LATIONS, INCLUDING CHILDREN,  ELDERLY,  CHRONICALLY  ILL,  PERSONS  WITH
 MENTAL  HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND PERSONS AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS OR HEPATITIS
 C.
  (C) IN THE EVENT THAT THE PATIENT DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA IN  PARA-
 GRAPH  (B)  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION, THE PRESCRIBER MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION TO THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER TO JUSTIFY THE USE  OF  A  NON-
 PREFERRED  DRUG. THE SYSTEM SHALL PROVIDE A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR A
 PRESCRIBER TO REASONABLY PRESENT  HIS  OR  HER  JUSTIFICATION  OF  PRIOR
 S. 7051  4
 
 AUTHORIZATION.  IF,  AFTER  CONSULTATION WITH THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER,
 THE PRESCRIBER, IN HIS OR HER REASONABLE PROFESSIONAL  JUDGMENT,  DETER-
 MINES  THAT  THE  USE  OF  A  NON-PREFERRED  DRUG  IS  WARRANTED,  THE
 PRESCRIBER'S DETERMINATION SHALL BE FINAL.
  (D)  IF A PRESCRIBER MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OR (C) OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION, THE PRESCRIBER SHALL BE  GRANTED  PRIOR  AUTHORIZATION
 UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (E)  IN  THE INSTANCE WHERE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DETERMINATION IS NOT
 COMPLETED WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF THE ORIGINAL  REQUEST,  SOLELY  AS
 THE  RESULT  OF A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM (WHETHER BY ACTION OR INACTION),
 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED  WITH
 NO FURTHER ACTION BY THE PRESCRIBER AND THE PRESCRIBER SHALL BE NOTIFIED
 OF  THIS  DETERMINATION.  IN  THE  INSTANCE  WHERE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION
 DETERMINATION IS NOT COMPLETED WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF THE  ORIGINAL
 REQUEST  FOR  ANY OTHER REASON, A SEVENTY-TWO HOUR SUPPLY OF THE MEDICA-
 TION SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE SYSTEM AND THE PRESCRIBER SHALL  BE  NOTI-
 FIED OF THIS DETERMINATION.
  (F)  WHEN,  IN  THE  JUDGMENT  OF THE PRESCRIBER OR THE PHARMACIST, AN
 EMERGENCY CONDITION EXISTS, AND THE PRESCRIBER  OR  PHARMACIST  NOTIFIES
 THE  MANAGED  CARE PROVIDER THAT AN EMERGENCY CONDITION EXISTS, A SEVEN-
 TY-TWO HOUR EMERGENCY SUPPLY OF THE DRUG PRESCRIBED SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY
 AUTHORIZED BY THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER.
  (G) IN THE EVENT THAT A PATIENT PRESENTS A PRESCRIPTION TO  A  PHARMA-
 CIST  FOR A PRESCRIPTION DRUG THAT IS A NON-PREFERRED DRUG AND FOR WHICH
 THE PRESCRIBER HAS NOT OBTAINED A PRIOR  AUTHORIZATION,  THE  PHARMACIST
 SHALL, WITHIN A PROMPT PERIOD BASED ON PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, NOTIFY THE
 PRESCRIBER.  THE  PRESCRIBER  SHALL,  WITHIN  A  PROMPT  PERIOD BASED ON
 PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, EITHER SEEK PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR SHALL  CONTACT
 THE  PHARMACIST  AND  AMEND  OR  CANCEL THE PRESCRIPTION. THE PHARMACIST
 SHALL, WITHIN A PROMPT PERIOD BASED ON PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, NOTIFY THE
 PATIENT WHEN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION HAS BEEN OBTAINED OR DENIED OR WHEN THE
 PRESCRIPTION HAS BEEN AMENDED OR CANCELLED.
  (H) ONCE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF A PRESCRIPTION FOR A DRUG THAT IS  NOT
 ON THE PREFERRED DRUG LIST IS OBTAINED, PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SHALL NOT BE
 REQUIRED FOR ANY REFILL OF THE PRESCRIPTION.
  (I)  NO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION UNDER A QUALIFIED PRESCRIPTION DRUG SYSTEM
 SHALL BE REQUIRED FOR: (I) ATYPICAL ANTI-PSYCHOTICS;  (II)  ANTI-DEPRES-
 SANTS; (III) ANTI-RETROVIRALS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF HIV/AIDS OR HEPA-
 TITIS  C;  (IV)  ANTI-REJECTION DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF ORGAN AND
 TISSUE TRANSPLANTS; AND (V) ANY OTHER THERAPEUTIC CLASS FOR  THE  TREAT-
 MENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS, HIV/AIDS OR HEPATITIS C, APPROVED BY THE COMMIS-
 SIONER.
  5. CLINICAL DRUG REVIEW PROGRAM. IN THE CASE OF A DRUG FOR WHICH PRIOR
 AUTHORIZATION  IS REQUIRED UNDER THE CLINICAL DRUG REVIEW PROGRAM, PRIOR
 AUTHORIZATION SHALL BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CLINICAL DRUG  REVIEW  PROGRAM
 AND NOT UNDER THIS SECTION.
  6.  PRESCRIBER  CONDUCT.  THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER AND THE DEPARTMENT
 SHALL  MONITOR  THE  PRIOR  AUTHORIZATION  PROCESS  UNDER  A  QUALIFIED
 PRESCRIPTION DRUG SYSTEM FOR PRESCRIBING PATTERNS WHICH ARE SUSPECTED OF
 ENDANGERING  THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PATIENT OR WHICH DEMONSTRATE A
 LIKELIHOOD OF FRAUD OR ABUSE. THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER AND THE  DEPART-
 MENT SHALL TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTIONS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW TO INVES-
 TIGATE SUCH PRESCRIBING PATTERNS, TO TAKE REMEDIAL ACTION AND TO ENFORCE
 APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS.
  7. USE OF PREFERRED DRUG PROGRAM. THE COMMISSIONER MAY CONTRACT WITH A
 MANAGED CARE PROVIDER FOR THE PROVIDER TO USE THE PREFERRED DRUG PROGRAM
 S. 7051  5
 
 TO  PROVIDE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER'S QUALI-
 FIED PRESCRIPTION DRUG SYSTEM. THE CONTRACT SHALL INCLUDE TERMS REQUIRED
 BY THE COMMISSIONER TO MAXIMIZE SAVINGS  TO  THE  MEDICAID  PROGRAM  AND
 PROTECT  THE HEALTH AND INTERESTS OF THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER'S PARTIC-
 IPANTS. THE CONTRACT SHALL PROVIDE WHETHER THE  PREFERRED  DRUG  PROGRAM
 SHALL  USE  THE  MANAGED CARE PROVIDER'S LISTS OF PREFERRED AND NON-PRE-
 FERRED DRUGS OR  THE  PREFERRED  DRUG  LIST  UNDER  THE  PREFERRED  DRUG
 PROGRAM, WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED.

 ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THIS ARTICLE PRESCRIBED IN RELATION  TO
 A  SERVICE  PROVIDED  BY  THE  APPROVED  ORGANIZATION  SHALL BE EITHER A
 PREFERRED OR NON-PREFERRED DRUG UNDER THE  QUALIFIED  PRESCRIPTION  DRUG
 SYSTEM. IF THE APPROVED ORGANIZATION DOES NOT PAY FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
 UNDER  A  QUALIFIED  PRESCRIPTION  DRUG  SYSTEM,  THEN  PAYMENT  FOR
 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR THE APPROVED ORGANIZATION'S PATIENTS SHALL NOT BE
 INCLUDED IN SUCH PAYMENTS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SHALL BE  PROVIDED  FOR
 THE  APPROVED  ORGANIZATION'S  PARTICIPANTS  UNDER  THE  PREFERRED  DRUG
