 Introduced  by  Sen. SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  requiring  owners
  of  multiple  dwelling properties to develop, implement and distribute
  smoking policies

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings.  Secondhand smoke is produced from
 the lighted end of tobacco products and from smoke exhaled from a  smok-
 er.  Secondhand smoke is a known carcinogen and exposure to it is linked
 to  increased  risk  of  cancer,  respiratory  complications  and  heart
 disease.  Any  level of exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful to chil-
 dren and adults; it is estimated that 3,400  nonsmoking  adults  die  of
 lung cancer and up to one million asthmatic children have worsened asth-
 ma  and  asthma-related  problems  each  year  in the United States as a
 result of inhaling secondhand smoke.  Private owners and public  housing
 authorities may restrict smoking in or on their properties. In buildings
 with  multifamily  units,  smoke  can  spread  between units through air
 ducts, cracks and elevator shafts and  involuntarily  expose  nonsmoking
 tenants.  Secondhand  smoke often cannot be controlled using ventilation
 systems, air cleaning,  or  separating  non-smokers  from  smokers.  The
 intent  of  this  legislation  is to require owners of multiple dwelling
 properties to develop, incorporate into leases and  condominium  bylaws,
 and  to  distribute smoking policies to current and prospective tenants.
 The bill acts to help nonsmokers protect themselves and  their  families
 from secondhand smoke by providing information they can weigh in select-
 ing  a  new  residence in a multiple dwelling building and to reduce the
 number of conflicts between nonsmokers and smokers.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  1399-y
 to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
