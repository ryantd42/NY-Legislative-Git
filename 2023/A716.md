 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that it is
 beneficial to students of this state to have access to an education that
 is  not  bound by borders and to have the opportunity to obtain a global
 education. The legislature further finds that it is important  that  New
 York  state  undertake  efforts to ensure that its students succeed in a
 world that is continually becoming more interdependent and  diverse  and
 further  that  students  have  access  to international higher education
 institutions.  A global education allows students  to  connect,  compete
 and  cooperate  with  their  peers around the world. Therefore it is the
 policy of the state  that  colleges  not  use  state  funds  to  support
 boycotts of countries, or higher education institutions located in coun-
 tries, that host higher education institutions chartered by the board of
 regents of the university of the state of New York.
  § 2. 1. For purposes of this section the following shall apply:
  (a)  the term "academic entity" shall mean any organization comprising
 colleges, universities or professors that promotes or supports  academia
 in the United States and abroad.
  (b)  the  term  "college"  shall have the same meaning as such term is
 defined in subdivision 2 of section 2 of the education law.
  (c) the term "host country" shall mean those  countries  that  host  a
 higher  education  institution  chartered by the board of regents of the
 university of the state of New York.
  2. No college in this state may use state  aid  provided  directly  to
 such  college  to: fund an academic entity, provide funds for membership
 in an academic entity or fund travel or  lodging  for  any  employee  to

 attend  any  meeting of such academic entity if such entity has issued a
 public resolution or other official statement or undertaken an  official
 action  boycotting  a  host  country  or  higher  education institutions
 located in such country.
  3. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no college shall be eligi-
 ble  for  state  aid  during  the  academic year that such college is in
 violation of subdivision two of this section.
  4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any college:
  (a) when such college is located in a country that  is  determined  by
 the United States secretary of state to be a state sponsor of terrorism;
  (b) when such boycott is connected with a labor dispute; or
  (c)  when  such  boycott  is  for  the  purpose of protesting unlawful
 discriminatory practices as determined by the laws, rules or regulations
 of this state.
  5. Nothing in this section shall limit the attendance by any  employee
 of  a  college  at  any event of an academic entity that boycotts a host
 country or higher education institutions located  in  such  country  and
 attendance  at  meetings  of  any  such  entity shall not be used by the
 college with regard to employment decisions.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
