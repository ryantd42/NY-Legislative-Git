 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  CUNNINGHAM  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in  relation  to  establishing  a
  long COVID-19 review board
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative intent. The legislature finds, determines  and
 declares  that COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the state of New
 York. Since the first recorded death of a New  York  resident  from  the
 virus on March fourteenth, two thousand twenty, tens of thousands of New
 Yorkers  have  lost  their  lives  to COVID-19. The sudden emergence and
 rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world has led to an evolving  under-
 standing  of  the transmissibility, virulence, and symptoms of the virus
 by scientists and public health experts  that  continues  to  this  day.
 There  is  growing  awareness  and  concern about post-COVID conditions,
 sometimes referred to as "long COVID," in which a small but  significant
 percentage  of  patients  experience persistent symptoms weeks or months
 after recovering from their initial infection.  It  is  vital  that  the
 state of New York commit to monitoring and tracking the long-term health
 impacts  of  COVID-19,  even as effective vaccines are widely available.
 Studying New Yorkers who survived COVID-19 infection holds  the  promise
 of  providing  public health experts with information that may lead to a
 better understanding of trends in long-term illness  and  recovery,  and
 the  needs  of  survivors,  particularly those suffering from post-COVID
 conditions.
  § 2. Section 2180 of the public health law is amended by adding a  new
 subdivision 21 to read as follows:
  21.  "LONG COVID" MEANS SYMPTOMS THAT PERSIST AFTER THE ACUTE COVID-19
 INFECTION HAS RESOLVED.
  § 3. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 2184  to
 read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
