achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and

  WHEREAS,  The  36th  Annual  New  York  Wine Classic is a nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years  and
allowing  wine  enthusiasts  to  enjoy  this unique part of the New York

New York City, Coffee Pot Cellars is a small-production  winery  with  a
vast  portfolio  of  artisanal,  ultra-premium  wines  which reflect its
passion for the region and its commitment to quality; and
 
  WHEREAS, Named after the distinctively-shaped lighthouse that guides
ships passing Orient Point to their destinations, Coffee Pot Cellars  is
the  realization  of  veteran  North  Folk  winemaker Adam Suprenant who
combines grapes  from  expertly-farmed  vineyards  with  the  winemaking
skills  he  has  honed  over  a  distinguished  career  which includes a
UC-Davis Master's degree, training at Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and  top
Napa  Valley  wineries,  and  over  20  years  of  making award-winning,
critically-acclaimed wine on the North Folk; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its  mission,  Coffee  Pot  Cellars  will
continue  to  make  remarkably  good and interesting wines from the best
fruit North Folk vineyards can provide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Coffee Pot Cellars is in direct  correlation
to  the efforts of its dedicated owners and staff, whose involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
 
all endeavors on behalf of  the  businesses  and  the  communities  they
serve; and

acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident it will  continue  to  enjoy  the
