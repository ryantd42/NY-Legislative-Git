 contractor providing pupil transportation services to such district  may
 amend  a  contract for pupil transportation services upon a finding that
 such amendment is necessary to comply with any federal, state  or  local
 law, rule or regulation imposed after the execution of such contract, or
 to  enhance  the  safety  of  pupil transportation, as determined by the
 board or trustee subject to the approval of the commissioner pursuant to
 regulations which shall require demonstrable enhancements in pupil safe-
 ty and/or increased savings consistent with  maintaining  pupil  safety.
 Such  amendment shall cause no additional cost to the state, locality or

 ESTABLISHED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST AN EQUIVALENT
 INCREASE  IN  THE  AMOUNT  OF  SUCH  CONTRACTOR'S COST OF OPERATION. The
 commissioner shall not approve such an  amendment  if  the  commissioner
 finds that it circumvents the competitive bidding requirements contained
 in  paragraph  a of this subdivision, or otherwise violates this section
