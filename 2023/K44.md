  COMMEMORATING  the  Town  of  Clarence  Veteran's
  Memorial, and paying just tribute to local  veterans
  who made the ultimate sacrifice for this great State
  and Nation
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of  the United States Armed Forces, who served so
faithfully and courageously in wars in which our Nation's freedom was at
stake, as well as in the preservation of peace during peacetime, deserve
the highest commendation of this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedication and sacrifices  of  our  military  personnel
ensure  our  continued  role  as  a  Nation which embodies the ideals of
democracy, and is a defender  of  liberty  for  peoples  throughout  the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
Town of Clarence Veteran's Memorial, and to pay just  tribute  to  local
veterans  who  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice  for  this great State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town of  Clarence  Veteran's  Memorial  was  officially
dedicated  on  Memorial  Day,  May  31,  2021,  and  is dedicated to the
millions of United States Military Veterans who have served and continue
to serve our country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Overseen and provided by the Clarence Rotary Foundation, in
conjunction with the support and project management  from  the  Town  of
Clarence,  the  site is located at the Clarence Main Street Town Park in
front of the historic Clarence Town Clubhouse; and
 
  WHEREAS, A memorial  fountain,  with  names  of  Clarence  residents
killed  in  action,  is at the center of the site, with five surrounding
granite walls that include nearly 500 Veterans honoring their service to
our country; and
 
  WHEREAS, The modest height of the panels serves to  blend  into  the
historic  nature  of  the surrounding landscape; enduring materials were
chosen for  the  memorial,  with  granite  forever  stone  ensuring  the
preservation of this vital tribute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  pursuit  for creating the Clarence Veteran's Memorial
began after the loss of Captain Andrew D.  Byers,  a  longtime  Clarence
resident, honor student and star athlete; and
 
  WHEREAS, After graduating from the United States Military Academy in
2008,  and serving over eight years with several overseas trips with the
United States Armed Forces,  Captain  Byers  was  killed  in  action  in
Afghanistan,  while  performing  rescue efforts to save his platoon from
enemy fire in November of 2016; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this  time,  Captain  Byers'  twin  sister,  Lauren,
commented  how  there was no place to go to honor and remember the names
of the soldiers of Clarence, New York; subsequently, the Clarence Rotary
 
Foundation took immediate action and created a permanent gathering place
where tribute can be paid to Clarence residents, relatives, friends, and
fellow Americans who served; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which these men and women served their country, and must recognize
that no greater debt is owed than that owed  to  those  who  gave  their
lives  for  their beloved Nation and to those who continue to be missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and  abroad,
these  brave men and women demonstrated their love for their country and
merit forevermore the highest respect of his State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's veterans deserve to be  recognized,  commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the Town of Clarence Veteran's Memorial,  and  to  pay  just
tribute to local veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice for this great
State and Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Clarence Rotary Foundation.
