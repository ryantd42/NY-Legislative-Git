 AN ACT to amend the education law,  in  relation  to  reimbursement  for

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3602 of the education law is amended  by  adding  a
 new subdivision 14-a to read as follows:
  14-A.  DISTRICTS  SHALL BE REIMBURSED FOR ANY ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED
 RELATING TO ANY STUDY THAT IS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF
 APPROVING A REORGANIZATION. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS  SUBDIVISION  THE  TERM
 "REORGANIZATION"  SHALL  MEAN  ANY  MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR ANNEXATION
 ELIGIBLE FOR AID UNDER SUBDIVISION FOURTEEN OF THIS SECTION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 if  upon  such effective date, an appropriation to the education depart-
 ment shall not have been made for reimbursement of school districts  and
 boards  of  cooperative  educational services for the purposes of imple-
 menting the provisions of subdivision 14-a of section 3602 of the educa-
 tion law, as added by section one of this act, then this act shall  take
 effect  on  the forty-fifth day after such an appropriation is made, and
 provided, further, that the division of  the  budget  shall  notify  the
 legislative  bill  drifting  commission  upon  enactment whether such an
 appropriation has been made, and if such appropriation  shall  not  have
 been made on or before such date, the division of the budget shall noti-
 fy the legislative bill drafting commission upon the date such an appro-
 priation shall have been made, in order that the commission may maintain
 an  accurate  and timely effective data base of the official text of the
 laws of the state  of  New  York  in  furtherance  of  effectuating  the
 provisions  of section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of the
 public officers law.
