  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 18, 2023, as Haitian Flag Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
organizations  which  foster  ethnic  pride  and  enhance the profile of
cultural diversity which strengthens the fabric of  the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 18, 2023, as Haitian
Flag Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, From May 15-18, 1803, the Congress of Arcahaie convened  to
unite  the  command of the revolutionary army under one authority and to
adopt a flag; it was not until May 18, 1803, that flag  adoption  became
an issue; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  flag  debate  lasted  the  entire  day, with one side
suggesting the slogan "Liberty or Death"; finally the  Congress  adopted
the blue and red bicolor, which is the flag of Haiti; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Catherine  Flon had sewn the original flag on the last day
of the Congress of Arcahaie, and the generals swore an oath of  "Liberty
or  Death"  on  the  flag,  which  was to lead the slaves to victory and
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of Haiti take a great deal  of  pride  in  their
nation's flag; after struggling for years to rid their territory of both
slavery  and  imperialism,  Haitian revolutionaries were able to achieve
such goals; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is no greater symbol of their everlasting  dedication
to  an  independent Haiti than the flag which represents their triumphs;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The descendants of these revolutionaries are  so  proud  of
them that students of Haitian backgrounds within the United States dress
with the colors of the flag throughout the week of May 18th, celebrating
when the flag was first created; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to urge the
citizens of New York State to join those of Haitian backgrounds as  they
rejoice  in  the accomplishments of their ancestors by memorializing May
18, 2023, as Haitian Flag Day; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 18, 2023, as Haitian
Flag Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
