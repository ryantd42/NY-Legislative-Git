 Introduced  by  Sen.  CLEARE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the court of claims act and the tax law, in relation  to
  claims  for unjust conviction; to amend the education law, in relation
  to establishing wrongful  conviction  recovery  scholarships;  and  to
  amend  the civil service law, in relation to allowing additional cred-
  its for the wrongfully convicted
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "wrongful
 conviction recovery act".
  § 2. Section 8-b of the court of claims act, as added by chapter  1009
 of the laws of 1984, subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 210 of the laws
 of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  § 8-b. Claims for unjust conviction [and imprisonment].  1. The legis-
 lature  finds  and  declares that innocent persons who have been wrongly
 convicted of crimes [and subsequently imprisoned] have  been  frustrated
 in  seeking  legal redress due to a variety of substantive and technical
 obstacles in the law and that such  persons  should  have  an  available
 avenue  of  redress  over  and  above the existing tort remedies to seek
 compensation for damages. The legislature intends by  enactment  of  the
 provisions  of  this  section that those innocent persons who can demon-
 strate by [clear and convincing] A PREPONDERANCE OF  THE  evidence  that
 they were unjustly convicted [and imprisoned] be able to recover damages
 against the state. In light of the substantial burden of proof that must
 be carried by such persons, it is the intent of the legislature that the
 court,  in  exercising  its discretion as permitted by law regarding the
 weight and admissibility of evidence submitted pursuant to this section,
 shall, in the interest of justice, give due consideration  to  difficul-
 ties of proof caused by the passage of time, the death or unavailability

 of witnesses, the destruction of evidence or other factors not caused by
 such persons or those acting on their behalf.
  2.  Any person convicted [and subsequently imprisoned] for one or more
 felonies or misdemeanors against the state  which  he  OR  SHE  did  not
 commit  may,  under the conditions hereinafter provided, present a claim
 for damages against the  state.  In  scheduling  court  appearances  and
 filing  deadlines, the court shall give docket priority at each stage of
 the proceeding to such claims for damages under this  subdivision  where
 the  claimant  asserts  proof  of  innocence  through  DNA evidence. Any
 adjournments granted in the course of such a proceeding should be for as
 short a time as is practicable.
  3. In order to present the claim for unjust conviction [and  imprison-
 ment], claimant must establish by documentary evidence that:
  (a)  he OR SHE has been convicted of one or more felonies or misdemea-
 nors against the state [and subsequently sentenced to a term  of  impri-
 sonment, and has served all or any part of the sentence]; and
  (b)  (i)  he  OR SHE has been pardoned upon the ground of innocence of
 the crime or crimes for which he OR SHE was sentenced and which are  the
 grounds for the complaint; or (ii) his OR HER judgment of conviction was
 reversed  or  vacated,  and the accusatory instrument dismissed or, if a
 new trial was ordered, either he OR SHE was found not guilty at the  new
 trial  or  he  OR  SHE  was  not  retried  and the accusatory instrument
 dismissed; provided that the  [judgement]  JUDGMENT  of  conviction  was
 reversed or vacated, and the accusatory instrument was dismissed, on any
 of  the  following grounds: (A) [paragraph (a), (b), (c), (e) or (g) of]
 subdivision one of section 440.10 of the criminal procedure law; or  (B)
 [subdivision  one  (where based upon grounds set forth in item (A) here-
 of), two, three (where the count dismissed was the sole  basis  for  the
 imprisonment  complained  of) or five of] section 470.20 of the criminal
 procedure law; or (C) comparable provisions of the former code of crimi-
 nal procedure or subsequent law; or  (D)  the  statute,  or  application
 thereof,  on  which  the  accusatory  instrument  was based violated the
 constitution of the United States or the state of New York; and
  (c) his OR HER claim is not time-barred by the provisions of  subdivi-
 sion seven of this section.
  4.  The  claim  shall  state  facts in sufficient detail to permit the
 court to find that claimant is likely to succeed  at  trial  in  proving
 that (a) he OR SHE did not commit any of the acts charged in the accusa-
 tory instrument or his OR HER acts or omissions charged in the accusato-
 ry  instrument  did  not  constitute a felony or misdemeanor against the
 state, and (b) he OR SHE did not by his OR  HER  own  conduct  cause  or
 bring  about  his  OR HER conviction. The claim shall be verified by the
 claimant. If the court finds after reading the claim  that  claimant  is
 not  likely  to  succeed at trial, it shall dismiss the claim, either on
 its own motion or on the motion of the state.
  5. In order to obtain a judgment in his OR HER  favor,  claimant  must
 prove by [clear and convincing] A PREPONDERANCE OF THE evidence that:
  (a)  he OR SHE has been convicted of one or more felonies or misdemea-
 nors against the state [and subsequently sentenced to a term  of  impri-
 sonment, and has served all or any part of the sentence]; and
  (b)  (i)  he  OR SHE has been pardoned upon the ground of innocence of
 the crime or crimes for which he OR SHE was sentenced and which are  the
 grounds for the complaint; or (ii) his OR HER judgment of conviction was
 reversed  or  vacated,  and the accusatory instrument dismissed or, if a
 new trial was ordered, either he OR SHE was found not guilty at the  new
 trial  or  he  OR  SHE  was  not  retried  and the accusatory instrument
 S. 6969  3
 
 dismissed; provided that the  [judgement]  JUDGMENT  of  conviction  was
 reversed or vacated, and the accusatory instrument was dismissed, on any
 of  the  following grounds: (A) [paragraph (a), (b), (c), (e) or (g) of]
 subdivision  one of section 440.10 of the criminal procedure law; or (B)
 [subdivision one (where based upon grounds set forth in item  (A)  here-
 of),  two,  three  (where the count dismissed was the sole basis for the
 imprisonment complained of) or five of] section 470.20 of  the  criminal
 procedure law; or (C) comparable provisions of the former code of crimi-
 nal  procedure  or  subsequent  law;  or (D) the statute, or application
 thereof, on which the  accusatory  instrument  was  based  violated  the
 constitution of the United States or the state of New York; and
  (c) he OR SHE did not commit any of the acts [charged in the accusato-
 ry instrument or his acts or omissions charged in the accusatory instru-
 ment]  OR OMISSIONS FOR WHICH HE OR SHE WAS CONVICTED OR HIS OR HER ACTS
 OR  OMISSIONS  did  not  constitute  a felony or misdemeanor against the
 state; and
  (d) he OR SHE did not by his OR HER own conduct cause or  bring  about
 his OR HER conviction.
  6.  If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to a judgment, it
 shall award damages in such sum of money as the  court  determines  will
 fairly  and  reasonably compensate him OR HER, PROVIDED, IF THE CLAIMANT
 WAS INCARCERATED, SUCH SUM SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN AN AWARD CALCULATED AT
 A RATE OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR DURING  WHICH  THE  CLAIMANT  WAS
 INCARCERATED  AND WAS NOT UNDER SENTENCE FOR A SEPARATE CRIME. THE COURT
 MAY ALSO AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES  INCURRED  IN  THE  CLAIMANT'S
 DEFENSE  AT  TRIAL,  INCLUDING ANY POST-TRIAL MOTIONS OR APPEALS, IN THE
 PROCESS OF VACATING OR REVERSING HIS OR HER CRIMINAL CONVICTION, AND  IN
 THE PURSUIT OF A CLAIM UNDER THIS SECTION.
  7.  Any  person  claiming  compensation  under this section based on a
 pardon that was granted before the effective date of this section or the
 dismissal of an accusatory instrument that occurred before the effective
 date of THE CHAPTER OF  THE  LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE  THAT
 AMENDED  this section shall file his OR HER claim within two years after
 [the] SUCH effective date  [of  this  section].  Any  person  claiming
 compensation under this section based on a pardon that was granted on or
 after  the effective date of this section or the dismissal of an accusa-
 tory instrument that occurred on or after  the  effective  date  of  THE
 CHAPTER  OF  THE  LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE THAT AMENDED this
