 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to enacting the New  York
  State Resident Experience Act of 2023
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York State Resident Experience Act of 2023".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that the New York state
 government serves the people of the state of New York and should seek to
 continually  improve  the  provision of services based on resident feed-
 back.  While many state agencies, offices, and programs  provide  excel-
 lent  service to New Yorkers, there are many areas ripe for improvement,
 particularly within  agencies  that  provide  extensive  resident-facing
 services.  Providing  quality  services to residents improves the confi-
 dence of New Yorkers in their  government  and  helps  agencies  achieve
 greater  impact  and fulfill their missions. Improving services to resi-
 dents requires agencies to leverage technology, collect and share stand-
 ardized data, and develop customer-centered mindsets and service strate-
 gies. It is the legislature's belief that all agencies should strive  to
 provide  high-quality,  courteous,  effective, and efficient services to
 New Yorkers and seek to measure, collect, report,  and  utilize  metrics
 relating  to  the  experience  of residents interacting with agencies to
 continually improve provision of services to the people of the state  of
 New York.
  §  3.  The  executive  law is amended by adding a new section 170-g to
 read as follows:
  § 170-G. COLLECTION OF VOLUNTARY RESIDENT EXPERIENCE FEEDBACK. 1.  FOR
 PURPOSES  OF  THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING
 MEANINGS:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
