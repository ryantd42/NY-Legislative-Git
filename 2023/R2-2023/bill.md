duties as given by law or these rules during the 2023-2024 session.
 
  § 2. He or she shall appoint and designate the Officers of the Senate,

defined in this  section,  who  shall  be  responsible  for  collecting,
numbering, indexing and retaining the same in the Legislative Library in
an  area  designated for such use by the Legislative Librarian. At least
two copies of all such documents shall be kept in such  library  at  all

approved for archiving documents.
 
  To  effectuate the purposes of this section, the Assistant Legislative

committee,  commission, task force or office of the Legislature, and the
same are authorized to provide, such assistance, services  and  data  as

in this section.
 
  For purposes of this section,  the  term  legislative  document  shall
include  the  Rules of the Senate, the Rules of the Assembly, reports of

special order for a particular day, and it shall  not  be  completed  on
that  day,  it  shall, unless otherwise ordered, retain its place on the
calendar as a special order in the order of business  in  which  it  was
considered.  When a special order is under consideration, it shall take
precedence over any special order for a subsequent hour of the same day;
but such subsequent order may be taken up immediately after disposal  of

reported  from  a standing committee shall be placed on the first report
calendar and, unless starred, shall be  automatically  advanced  to  the
second  report  part of the calendar after one calendar legislative day.
Bills on second report shall, unless starred, be advanced to  the  order
of  third reading after one calendar legislative day. No debate shall be
allowed on the advancement of bills on the  order  of  first  or  second
report  or  special  report. The order of special report shall be marked
with an asterisk to indicate that such bills will be subject  to  debate
on  the  next calendar legislative day. In the event that such bills are
not debated on such day, they shall be removed from the order of special
report and placed on that part of  the  calendar  designated  "bills  on
order of first report".
 
  §  7.  Executive  Session.  The  Senate  may only enter into executive
session in a manner consistent with Article VII of the  Public  Officers
Law, known as the "Open Meetings Law".
 
  §  8.  Motions.  a.  When  a  question  is before the Senate, only the

debate,  and  shall always be in order except as provided in Rules five,
seven and nine.
 
  c. Except for the motions enumerated  in  subdivision  a  hereof,  all
other  motions  shall be reduced to writing, if desired by the Presiding
Officer or any five Senators, delivered to the Secretary of the  Senate,
and  read  before  the  same  shall  be  debated;  and any motion may be
withdrawn at any time before decision or amendment.
 
  d. A motion for the previous question, or a motion to  postpone  to  a
certain  day,  or to commit, or refer to a standing or select committee,
until it is decided, shall preclude all debate of the main question.
 
  e. A motion for the previous question shall only be in order when made
by the leaders of the respective  conferences  or  their  designee.  The
"previous  question"  shall  be put as follows: "Shall the main question
now be put before the house?" and until it is  decided,  shall  preclude
all  amendments  or  debate.  When, on taking the previous question, the
Senate shall decide that the main question shall now be  put,  the  main
question shall be put to an immediate vote. When, on taking the previous
question,  the  Senate shall decide that the main question shall not now
be put, the main question shall be considered as still  remaining  under
debate.  The  "main question" shall be the advancement or passage of the
bill, resolution or other matter under consideration. Such motion  shall
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators elected.
 
  §  9.  Reconsideration.  a.  When  a  question  has  once been put and
decided, it  shall  be  in  order  for  any  Senator  to  move  for  the
reconsideration  thereof;  but  no motion for the reconsideration of any
vote shall be in order after  the  bill,  resolution,  message,  report,
amendment,  nomination  or  motion, upon which the vote was taken, shall
have gone out of the possession of the Senate; nor shall any motion  for
reconsideration  be  in  order  unless made on the same day on which the
vote was taken, or within the next three days of the actual  session  of
the  Senate thereafter. Nor shall any question be reconsidered more than
once; but when a bill or resolution shall have been  recalled  from  the
Assembly,  a  motion  for  reconsideration  may  be  made  at  any  time
 
thereafter while the same is in the possession of the  Senate,  and  all
resolutions  recalling  a  bill or resolution from the Assembly shall be
regarded as privileged. No vote shall be reconsidered upon either of the
following motions:
 
  (i) To adjourn.
 
  (ii) To lay on the table.
 
  b.  The  vote on the final passage of any bill appropriating moneys or
property, or creating, continuing, altering or removing any body politic
or corporate, shall not be reconsidered whenever any such bill shall  be
lost,  unless  by  a vote of a majority of all the Senators elected, but
all other bills, when the same shall have been lost, may be reconsidered
by a vote of a majority of all the Senators present and voting.
 
  RULE VI
 
INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS
 
  Section  1. Introduction. Bills and resolutions shall be introduced by
a Senator, or on the report of a  committee,  or  by  message  from  the
Assembly,  or  by  order  of  the Senate, or by the Governor pursuant to
Article VII of  the  Constitution.  Every  bill  introduced  shall  have
endorsed thereon a title and the name of the bill's sponsor and shall be
accompanied  by  the  introducer's  memorandum.  Such  memorandum  shall
contain a statement of the purposes and intent of the bill and,  if  the
member  deems  it  appropriate, may set forth such other statements that
the member feels necessary including, but  not  limited  to,  statements
relating  to  economic impact, environmental impact or the impact on the
judicial system. A Committee, where it deems necessary, may require that
the introducer's memorandum  be  amended  to  include  such  appropriate
statements.  Bills  shall  be  introduced  in  a  manner  or  method  in
accordance  with  any  other  guidelines  provided  by  the  Temporary
President.
 
  Bills  introduced  by  Senators  shall  be deposited with the Revision
Clerk for the purpose of having such clerk examine and correct bills  to
avoid  repetition  of  introduction  and ensure accuracy in the text and
references. Upon introduction, each bill shall be deemed to have had its
first and second reading, unless otherwise ordered and shall be given  a
number.  The  Temporary  President  shall  refer  bills  or designate an
officer to refer bills to  the  appropriate  standing  committee.  Bills
shall be referred in accordance with a set of guidelines to be published
annually  by  the  Temporary  President  setting  forth  the  respective
statutes over which each of the standing committees shall  have  subject
matter  jurisdiction  for  purposes  of  referral.  Such referrals shall
reflect the subject matter having predominance in the bill as determined
by the Temporary President.
 
  §  2.  Multi-sponsorship.  Any  Senator  may  join  together  in  the
multi-sponsorship  of a bill. If two or more Senators join together when
a bill is first introduced and before it is published, the names of  all
multi-sponsors  shall  appear  on  the  printed  bill upon the following
conditions:
 
  a. Multi-sponsors shall file a written request  to  act  as  such,  on
forms  provided,  with  the Revision Clerk of the Senate. The first name
appearing on the bill shall be deemed  the  introducer  and  all  others
deemed multi-sponsors.
 
  b.  The  introducer shall at all times retain exclusive control of the
bill until formally acted upon by the Senate and any motion to discharge
a bill out of committee by a member who is not  the  introducer  of  the
bill shall be out of order.
 
  c.  After a multi-sponsored bill has been published, any multi-sponsor
desiring to withdraw from such multi-sponsorship shall  file  a  written
request on a form provided so that his or her name will be stricken as a
multi-sponsor  from  the  records  of  the Revision Clerk. The published
bill, however, shall not be republished.
 
  d. Senators and Senators-elect may multi-sponsor bills that have  been
pre-filed  and  bills  introduced  after the opening of each legislative
session upon the following conditions:
 
  (1)  After  a bill has been introduced and published and before it has
been reported favorably out of the Committee to which it  was  referred,
any  Senator or Senators may file with the Revision Clerk a request on a
form provided to become a multi-sponsor of such bill. Such forms must be
signed by the multi-sponsor.
 
  (2) Such bill shall not be reprinted solely for the purpose of  adding
or deleting names of multi-sponsors.
 
  §  3.  Placement  on  desks.  a.  Every  bill  immediately  upon  its
introduction shall be placed on the bill  files  on  the  desks  of  the
Senators,  where it shall remain for at least three calendar legislative
days. All bills reported favorably or  for  consideration,  if  reported
with  amendments,  and  all  bills  amended  in  the  Senate,  shall  be
immediately placed on each Senator's desk, except that any bill which is
amended by restoring it to an earlier form, shall not be required to  be
placed  on  each  Senator's desk again, and thereafter the number of the
bill in the form placed on each Senator's desk to which it has  been  so
restored  shall  constitute  the  final form of such bill unless further
amended. Whenever a bill is amended, a letter of the  alphabet  starting
with "A" shall be added to its number.
 
  b.  Any  requirement  provided  for  in  these  Rules for the copying,
printing, reprinting or placement of bills on the desks of  members  may
be  satisfied  with  either  bills printed on paper or bills provided in
electronic format as so described in section fourteen of Article III  of
the Constitution.
 
  §  4.  Title  and  body of bill. The title of every bill shall briefly
state the subject thereof. The title of every bill amending or repealing
any provision of a consolidated law shall refer to such law.  The  title
of  every  bill amending or repealing any unconsolidated law shall refer
to such law by its short title, if it has one; if it has no short title,
the title of such bill shall state the chapter number, year of enactment
and the complete title of the original bill or a short  summary  of  the
provisions  to  which  the  law  relates.  If  such  bill is amending or
repealing a proposed provision of law contained in a bill that  has  not
been  enacted  into  law,  the  title shall state the number of the bill
containing the proposed provision of law to be amended or repealed, with
suffix, if there be one, and the subject of the provisions to which  the
amendatory  bill  relates.  No private or local bill may be passed which
shall embrace more than one subject which  shall  be  expressed  in  the
title.
 
  a.  In  any bill, each section proposing an amendment to or the repeal
of:  (i) any consolidated law, or any part thereof; or (ii)  the  Family
Court  Act, the Court of Claims Act, the Uniform District Court Act, the
Uniform Justice Court Act, the Uniform City Court Act, the New York City
Charter, the Administrative Code of the City of New York, the  New  York
City  Civil  Court  Act,  the  New  York City Criminal Court Act, or the
Charter of the City of Buffalo, or any part thereof shall refer to  such
law,  act,  charter  or  code.  In  any  bill, each section proposing an
amendment to or the repeal of  an  unconsolidated  law  having  a  short
title,  or  any  part  thereof,  shall  refer to such law by its chapter
 
number and year of enactment and its short title. If  an  unconsolidated
law  shall  have  no  short  title, each section shall state the chapter
number and year of enactment of such law, and a  short  summary  of  the
provisions  to  which  the  law  relates  or  the  complete title of the
original bill. If such section amends or repeals a proposed provision of
law contained in a bill that has not been enacted into law, each section
shall state the number of the bill containing such  proposed  provisions
of  law  to be amended or repealed, with suffix, if there be one. If the
portion of the law proposed to be amended has been added, renumbered  or
amended since the original enactment or last general revision of the law
of  which it is a part, such section shall also state the chapter number
and year of the last act adding, renumbering or amending  the  same,  as
the case may be.  There shall be appended at the end of every bill which
proposes  the  repeal or extension of any existing law, or part thereof,
merely by reference thereto, without setting forth the text thereof,  an
explanatory  note  which  shall  briefly and concisely state the subject
matter of the law, or part thereof, proposed to be repealed or extended,
unless such subject matter is stated in the  title  of  such  bill.  The
Revision  Clerk  of  the  Senate  shall  return  any bill to the Senator
introducing the same when it is called to his or her attention that  the
provisions  of  this  section,  or of section one of this Rule, have not
been complied with,  or  when  any  copy  of  a  bill  is  illegible  or
incomplete.
 
  b.  Every bill when introduced, and every amendment thereafter made to
such bill amending existing law, must have all new  matter  underscored,
and  all matter eliminated by amendment from existing law must appear in
its proper place enclosed in brackets. In the published  bill  such  new
matter  shall be underscored and all matter eliminated by amendment from
existing law  shall  be  enclosed  in  black-faced  brackets.  When  any
existing  law  or part thereof is proposed to be repealed by a bill, the
word "repealed"  as  it  appears  in  such  bill  shall  be  printed  in
bold-faced  type.  When a bill is amended by eliminating new matter from
such bill, the same  shall  be  omitted  in  the  republication  of  the
original.  When  amendments  are offered to a printed bill, the proposed
changes, indicating page and line  numbers,  shall  be  listed  on  four
detail  sheets  and the same changes shall be incorporated and marked on
two copies of the bill; provided, however, that no  amendment  shall  be
allowed  to  any  bill  which  is  not germane to the original object or
purpose thereof.  Furthermore, when  a  printed  bill  is  amended  the
accompanying  introducer's  memorandum, required pursuant to section one
of this Rule, shall also be amended to reflect any changes. It shall  be
the  duty of the Secretary of the Senate to direct the Revision Clerk to
cause any bill appearing on the calendar and  not  complying  with  this
section to be immediately amended so as to comply with the same.
 
  §  5.  Final  date. a. The Temporary President may designate a date in
writing after which no bill or original resolution shall  be  introduced
except  by  message  from  the  Assembly, but no date prior to the first
Tuesday of April shall be so designated;  provided,  however,  that  all
bills  recommended  by a State department or agency must be submitted to
the Temporary President not later than the first  day  of  March.  Bills
proposed  by  the  Governor,  the Attorney General, the Comptroller, the
Department of Education or the Office of Court  Administration  must  be
submitted  to the Temporary President no later than the first Tuesday in
April.
 
  b. All bills introduced in the Senate after  the  first  day  of  June
shall be introduced to the Committee on Rules.
 
  §  6.  Budget  bills.  When  a  bill  is  submitted or proposed by the
Governor by authority of Article  VII  of  the  Constitution,  it  shall
become,  for  all  legislative  purposes,  a  legislative bill, and upon
receipt thereof by the Senate it shall be endorsed "Budget Bill" and  be
given  a  number  by  the Secretary and shall be referred to the Finance
Committee. Budget bills may  be  reported  from  the  Finance  Committee
direct to the third reading calendar.
 
  §  7.  Program,  departmental and agency bills. Every bill proposed by
the  Governor,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Comptroller  or  by  state
departments  and  agencies shall be submitted to the Temporary President
and shall be forwarded for  introduction  purposes  to  the  appropriate
standing committee in accordance with section one of this Rule. Any such
bill  which  is not so forwarded within three weeks after receipt by the
Temporary President shall be offered to the Minority Leader who  may  in
accordance  with  section  one  of  this Rule, forward such bills to any
member for introduction purposes.
 
  § 8. Reintroduction. Any Senate bill introduced in the first  year  of
the term of the Senate which during that regular Legislative Session was
not  reported  from  a  Standing  Committee  or  if  reported  and later
recommitted to a  Standing  Committee  is  deemed  to  be  automatically
reintroduced  for  the  second year of the term of the Senate. All bills
which remain on the calendar at the end of the first year of the term of
the Senate shall be recommitted to committee.
 
  § 9. Resolutions. a. All original resolutions shall be introduced in a
manner or method provided by the Temporary President,  and  no  original
resolution may be introduced unless copies thereof first shall have been
furnished,  to  the  extent  practicable, forty-eight hours prior to the
time for acting on  such  resolution  to  the  Temporary  President  and
Minority  Leader.  All resolutions, upon introduction, shall be referred
to a standing or select committee  by  the  Temporary  President  or  an
officer  designated  by  the  Temporary President and shall at all times
remain within the exclusive control of the  introducer.  Notwithstanding
any  of  the foregoing provisions of this section, resolutions recalling
bills  from  or  returning  bills  to  the  Assembly,  or  relating  to
adjournment, may be introduced at any time for immediate consideration.
 
  b.  A  resolution  supporting  or condemning, or proposing or urging a
change in Federal law which is not  directly  germane  to  the  affairs,
business,  rights,  benefits  and obligations of New York State shall be
out of order and shall not be reported and any resolution  recommending,
urging,  supporting,  altering  or  condemning  a  position or change in
foreign policy of the  United  States  Government  or  the  domestic  or
foreign  affairs  of  any  other government of the World shall be out of
order and shall not be reported. Any resolution which recommends, urges,
supports the alteration of the laws of  this  state,  resolutions  which
honor  current  elected  office  holders or resolutions which recognize,
honor or support the positions of a political  party  shall  be  out  of
order and shall not be reported.
 
  c.  All  resolutions  which  propose  any  amendment  to  the  State
Constitution shall be referred to the Attorney General  as  provided  in
Article  XIX  of the Constitution, and shall be treated in the same form
 
of proceedings as that provided for bills; and resolutions which  ratify
any proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States shall be
treated  in  the same form of proceedings as provided for bills. After a
resolution  to  amend  the State Constitution shall be advanced to third
reading, no motion to amend the same shall be in order without unanimous
consent; and if such resolution to amend the State Constitution shall be
amended after the opinion of  the  Attorney  General  thereon  has  been
received  as provided in Article XIX of the Constitution, it shall again
be referred  to  the  Attorney  General.  Any  such  resolution  may  be
committed prior to the final reading thereof.
 
  d.  All  resolutions  calling  for  the  expenditure of moneys must be
decided by a majority vote of all of the members elected to the  Senate,
upon a call of the roll.
 
  e. All resolutions deemed proper by the Temporary President other than
those  mentioned  and  treated  in the preceding subdivisions c and d of
this section and reported by the committee of  reference  designated  by
the  Temporary  President  shall  be  placed  upon the calendar upon the
approval of the Temporary President. When in the order of  business  the
resolutions  are  reached,  the  Senate  may adopt such resolutions as a
group, by  one  vote  upon  the  question  of  the  entire  calendar  of
resolution,  excepting  that any member may request that any one or more
of the resolutions on such calendar  shall  be  voted  upon  or  debated
separately. This subdivision shall not apply to any resolution recalling
bills  from  or  returning  bills  to  the  Assembly,  or  relating  to
adjournment or to resolutions pertaining to the rules of the  Senate  or
to  those  resolutions  regarded  as "privileged". A resolution shall be
deemed privileged  only  if  it  encompasses  a  subject  of  particular
importance  to  the  house  or  is a question of specific urgency and in
either case a resolution shall  only  be  deemed  privileged  if  it  is
designated by the Temporary President as such.

Such motions shall be in order forty-five days after  a  bill  has  been
referred to such committee. Once a motion for committee consideration is
filed,  the  chair  of the committee shall place the bill on a committee
agenda and schedule a vote on the bill within forty-five  days,  if  the
forty-five  days  shall  expire  while the senate is in recess, the bill
shall be placed on the  next  regularly  scheduled  committee  meeting's
agenda  following the end of the forty-five day period. In the case of a
bill  that  is  referred  to  a  standing  committee  having  secondary
reference,  the  bill  shall be considered within the next two committee
meetings.
 
  § 3. Ethics and Internal Governance Committee. The Ethics and Internal
Governance Committee may sit at any time and shall hold regular meetings
at such time and on such day as scheduled by the Temporary President  of
the  Senate  in  consultation with the Chair. The committee shall review
any matter deemed appropriate by the affirmative vote of  at  least  one
member  from  each  conference.  The  committee  shall  evaluate and, if
necessary, make recommendations regarding compliance with Rules X, XIII,
XIV and XV.  The  committee  shall  review,  and  if  necessary,  make
recommendations  regarding  policies  of  the  Senate, including but not
limited to per diem  and  travel  expenses,  time  and  attendance,  and
workplace  ethics.  The  committee  shall report annually as required in
sections four and five of Rule IV. The committee shall have jurisdiction
over any matter referred to it by the Secretary of the Senate pertaining
to the ethical conduct of legislative  members.  Any  recommendation  or
referral made by the committee on any matter other than a vote to report
legislation  from  the  committee  must have the affirmative vote of the
majority of members appointed and the affirmative vote of at  least  one
member from both the Majority and Minority Conferences.
 
  §  4.  Committee  on Rules. The Committee on Rules may sit at any time
and shall report bills out of committee only if  they  shall  have  been
duly  reported  to  the  Committee on Rules from a standing committee of
origin, or from a committee of secondary reference, or if the  chair  of
such  standing  committee  consents,  or if the bill was referred to the
Committee on Rules upon introduction. Other than a  motion  to  hold,  a
motion  to discharge, or a motion to report, no other motion shall be in
order in the Committee on Rules without the  consent  of  the  Committee
 
Chair.  The reception and consideration of its report shall always be in
order; debate on its adoption shall not exceed one hour,  with  one-half
hour  for  each  conference,  such  time to be allotted by the Temporary
President  and  Minority Leader; and no other motion, except a motion by
the Temporary President for a call of  the  Senate,  to  adjourn  or  to
recess,  shall  be in order until the vote of the Senate is had thereon.
If the report be adopted, all inconsistent rules  of  the  Senate  shall
automatically  be  suspended  until  the subject of such report has been
disposed of, including final action thereon.
 
  § 5. Hearings. a. Committee hearings. Chairs  of  standing  committees
may  call  public  hearings  to  permit  interested  persons,  groups or
organizations the  opportunity  to  testify  orally  or  in  writing  on
legislation or issues pending before such standing committee. Chairs are
encouraged  to  hold  public hearings on legislation of important public
interest, where, outside of the  budget,  significant  public  money  is
allocated,  broad conduct is regulated or where the proposal has a broad
public impact. Chairs may request that the Official Stenographer make  a
stenographic  record  of  a  public  hearing.  Official  hearings may be
conducted in accordance with procedure established by law. No  committee
may  take  testimony at a hearing unless at least two of its members are
present at such hearing. Prior notice of all public  hearings  shall  be
filed  by  the  chair  or  his or her designee with The Legislative Bill
Drafting Commission and the Secretary of  the  Senate  and  such  notice
shall contain information as to subject matter, date and place.
 
  b.  Public  forums.  Notwithstanding  the public hearings conducted by
standing committees, any Senator may convene a public forum on  proposed
or pending legislation within the jurisdiction of a committee upon which
he  or  she  is a member, provided that any charge incurred attendant to
such forum be borne by said Senator or  his  or  her  party  conference.
Prior  notice  of  such  forum  shall  be  filed  with  the chair of the
committee.
 
  c. Committee oversight function. Each standing committee  is  required
to  conduct  oversight  of  the  administration  of laws and programs by
agencies within its jurisdiction.
 
  d. Each standing committee is required to file with the  Secretary  of
the  Senate  an  annual  report, detailing its legislative and oversight
activities. Such report shall be posted to the Senate web site.
 
  e. Petition for a public hearing on a bill. By a petition of one-third
of the members assigned to a committee rounded up to the  nearest  whole
number, a public hearing shall be scheduled on a specific bill or number
of  bills within the jurisdiction of a committee, unless the majority of
members of the committee reject such petition. Such petitions  shall  be
submitted on the proper form to the Senate Desk for Operations, who will
forward  it  to  the appropriate committee, for presentation at the next
committee meeting. Such public hearings shall be held if they  meet  the
guidelines  as  promulgated  by the Temporary President. Public hearings
scheduled by petition will be held at least fourteen days following  the
committee meeting at which the petition was considered.
 
  f.  Hearings of standing committees shall be video recorded and to the
extent practicable webcast live. Video of such hearing shall  be  posted
to the Senate web site within twenty-four hours.
 
  §  6.  Reports.  a.  No committee shall vote to report a bill or other
matter unless a majority of all the members thereof  vote  in  favor  of
such  report. Each report of a committee upon a bill shall have the vote
of each Senator attached thereto and  such  report  and  vote  shall  be
available  for  public  inspection. A member's vote on any matter before
the committee shall be entered by the member on a signed official voting
sheet delivered to the Committee Chair.
 
  Any standing committee having secondary  subject  matter  jurisdiction
over  a  bill  may  request  the  chair  of the committee having primary
subject matter jurisdiction over said bill (which is  the  committee  to
which  the  said  bill  has  been  referred  by  the Temporary President
pursuant to Rule VI) to commit the bill to the committee with  secondary
subject matter jurisdiction either when the bill is still in the primary
committee or after it has been reported to the calendar. If the chair of
the  primary  committee  refuses said request, then the committee having
secondary jurisdiction, through its chair,  may  request  the  Temporary
President  consider such secondary referencing. If a secondary reference
is so made, the secondary committee shall consider  the  bill  forthwith
and  return  said  bill to the primary committee or the calendar, as the
case may be, along with the secondary committee's recommendations.
 
  All committee reports, after the first Friday in June, shall  be  made
directly  to  the  Committee  on Rules. Notwithstanding any provision of
Rule VI, the Committee on Rules shall have the  authority  to  introduce
and  refer bills to itself and shall also have the authority to refer to
itself any bill from any standing committee.
 
  Every report of a committee upon a bill which shall not be  considered
at  the  time  of making the same, or laid on the table by a vote of the
Senate, shall stand upon the calendar in the order of first report  with
the bill and be entered upon the journal.
 
  b.  Each bill reported by a standing committee may be accompanied by a
report, and the Minority Conference shall  file  a  Minority  Conference
committee  report  within  seven  days of the bill being reported out of
committee and said reports may be filed  with  the  Journal  Clerk.  The
report  of a committee upon any matter referred to it shall upon request
include a brief statement of the opinion of any member or members of the
committee voting in either the majority or minority.
 
  c. Where a "home rule" request is required as provided in any  section
of  Article IX of the Constitution, such request, certificate or message
must be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate before final  passage
of such bill.
 
  d.  Where  a  message of necessity is received from the Governor, such
message shall be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate  upon  final
passage of the bill.
 
  §  7. Nominations. Unless the Senate orders otherwise, all nominations
sent by the Governor  for  the  appointment  of  any  officer  shall  be
submitted  to  the  Temporary  President  who  shall  then  refer  such
nominations simultaneously to the Finance Committee, and the appropriate
standing  committee,  for  consideration  and  recommendation  and  such
standing  committees,  other  than  the  Committee  on  Judiciary  shall
thereafter refer such nominations to the Finance Committee of the Senate
who  shall  take  whatever  further  actions  it  deems  necessary  and
 
thereafter  make  its  report on the nominations to the full Senate. Any
Senator may submit a request  to  the  Chair  of  a  Standing  Committee
considering  a  nomination,  to  speak before the committee for not more
than  five  minutes  on the nomination. The granting of any such request
shall be at the sole discretion of the  Committee  Chair.  A  nomination
shall  not  be  confirmed  without  reference  on the day on which it is
received except by unanimous consent. The names of those who  voted  for
or  against the nomination may be entered alphabetically on the journal,
if any five Senators request it.
 
  § 8.  Finance  Committee.  A  bill  or  resolution  providing  for  an
appropriation or creating or increasing a charge upon the State Treasury
shall,  when reported by any committee other than the Finance Committee,
be referred to the Finance Committee, and the committee  reporting  such
bill  or  resolution shall, at the time of making such report, recommend
the further reference thereof to the Finance Committee. At  the  request
of  the  Temporary  President or the Chair of the Finance Committee, any
such bill or resolution shall, at  any  time  before  final  reading  or
adoption,  be  referred to the Finance Committee, which may consider and
report  upon  any  features  in  the  bill  or  resolution  creating  or
increasing such charge.
 
  The  sponsor  of a bill providing for an increase or decrease in state
revenues or in the appropriation or expenditure of state moneys, without
stating the amount thereof, must, before such bill is reported from  the
Finance  Committee  or  other committee to which referred, file with the
Finance Committee and such other committee a  fiscal  note  which  shall
state,  so  far  as  possible,  the amount in dollars whereby such state
moneys, revenues or appropriations  would  be  affected  by  such  bill,
together  with  a  similar estimate, if the same is possible, for future
fiscal years. Such an estimate must be secured by the sponsor  from  the
Division  of  the Budget or the department or agency of state government
charged with the fiscal duties, functions or  powers  provided  in  such
bill  and  the  name of such department or agency must be stated in such
note.
 
  The Finance Committee shall keep and maintain a  file  containing  all
bills  requiring  fiscal notes and the notes appertaining thereto, which
shall be available to Senators and officers of  the  Senate,  accredited
representatives  of  the  press,  and other responsible persons having a
legitimate interest therein.
 
  RULE VIII

  Section  1.  Bills  on  desks. No bill shall be passed unless it shall
have been upon the desk of  each  Senator  or  published  in  electronic
format  in its final form at least three calendar legislative days prior
to its final passage, unless the Governor or acting Governor shall  have
certified,  under  his  or her hand and the seal of the State, the facts
which in his or her opinion necessitate an immediate  vote  thereon,  in
which  case  it  must  nevertheless be upon the desks of all Senators in
final form, before its final passage. No bill shall be  passed  pursuant
to  a  message  of  necessity  unless a majority of the Senators vote to
approve the use of such message.
 
  § 2. Reading of bills. a. Every  bill  shall  receive  three  readings
previous to its being passed.
 
  b.  Upon  the  third  reading  of  a bill, the question upon its final
passage shall be taken immediately thereafter; provided,  however,  that
any bill may be committed prior to the final reading thereof.
 
  §  3. Third reading calendar. a. The Calendar of bills on the order of
third reading shall consist of all bills which have been advanced  to  a
third  reading  from  the order of second report or the order of special
report.
 
  b. All Senate bills,  when  advanced  to  a  third  reading  shall  be
referred automatically to the Jacketing Clerk, who shall cause each such
bill  to  be  readied  for  final  passage  in the same form as the last
printed copy thereof. All such bills shall be jacketed with  the  proper
jurat for certification of final passage attached.
 
  § 4. Amendments. a. A non-sponsor may move to amend a bill at any time
prior  to the completion of its third reading provided that at least two
hours before the time for the Senate to convene, a copy of the  proposed
amendment  or amendments to any bill on the list of bills compiled under
subdivision a of section six of this  Rule  has  been  served  upon  the
sponsor of the bill, and filed with the Journal Clerk. If a sponsor does
not  accept  such  amendment,  the  question  shall  be put to the house
whether a majority of members elected vote in favor of  the  non-sponsor
motion  to  amend,  and  such  motion  shall  pass only if a majority of
members elected vote aye. If the sponsor  accepts  the  amendment,  such
amended  bill  shall  be  ordered  amended  without  a  vote,  debate or
explanation, and such bill shall retain its place on the  Third  Reading
Calendar.
 
  b.  If  a majority of members elected vote in favor of the non-sponsor
motion to amend, the sponsor of the bill may make a motion  to  withdraw
their  name  from  sponsorship  to be substituted by a co-sponsor or the
Senator who moved to amend the bill.
 
  c. The introducer of any calendar  bill  may  offer  an  amendment  or
amendments  to  such  bill  and  such  amendment  or amendments shall be
accepted and the bill amended without a  vote,  debate  or  explanation,
provided, however, that in such case such bill may be recommitted by the
 
chair  of  the  standing  committee  that  reported  such  bill and such
recommittal shall also be without a vote, debate or explanation.
 
  §  5.  Substitution.  When  a  bill  is received as a message from the
Assembly, or at any  time  thereafter,  and  a  Senate  bill,  identical
therewith, is on the order of third reading, or in the order of first or
second  report, the Assembly bill may be substituted for the Senate bill
upon a vote of a majority of the Senate. A motion for such  substitution
shall  be  in  order  under  the  order of business of messages from the
Assembly, motions and resolutions, or the order of business in which the
Senate bill is.
 
  § 6. Final passage. a. Prior to  the  reading  of  the  third  reading
calendar of any given day, the Temporary President may publish an active
list  of  bills on the third reading calendar which may be acted upon on
that date and he or she may lay aside  any  bill  upon  which  no  final
action  may  be  taken,  provided however, that no bill shall be so laid
aside for a period exceeding five calendar legislative days. Bills  laid
aside by the Temporary President shall retain their place in the regular
order  of  business  until called for debate by the Temporary President.
Such active list shall be published to the extent practicable by 8  p.m.
the  previous  evening  or  within  two  hours  following the end of the
previous day's session, whichever is later.

shall  be  taken immediately after the third reading and without debate.
On the final passage of every bill and concurrent resolution a fast roll
call shall be taken by the Secretary calling the names of five Senators,
two of whom shall be the Temporary President  and  the  Minority  Leader
provided,  however,  that  each Senator's name shall be called on a slow
roll call if requested by five Senators. Each roll call,  including  the
names  of  the Senators who were absent shall be entered on the journal.
Upon each roll call vote, the Secretary shall announce the names of  the
Senators  voting  in the negative and the names of the Senators who were
absent. Such roll calls shall be available for  public  inspection  upon
request  in  the  office of the Journal Clerk. When a bill or concurrent
resolution does  not  receive  the  number  of  votes  required  by  the
Constitution  to  pass  it,  it  shall be declared lost, except in cases
provided for by subdivision d of section two of Rule IX.
 
  § 7. Starred bills. a.  A  bill  appearing  on  the  calendar  may  be
"starred"  only by or on behalf of the introducer, whereupon all further
action on such bill shall be suspended, although it retains its place on
the Calendar.
 
  b. Other than for the purpose of amendment or recommittal,  no  action
may  be taken on a bill from which a star has been removed until one day
after such removal.
 
  § 8. Recall and concurrence. All Senate bills amended by the Assembly,
and returned to the Senate, for its concurrence, and all  bills  amended
by  the  report  of  a  conference  committee,  shall  be subject to the
provisions of section one of this Rule.
 
  § 9. Transmittal of bills to the Governor. All Senate bills passed  by
the  Senate  and sent to the Assembly for action shall, upon passage and
return by the Assembly to the Senate, be transmitted by the Secretary of
the Senate to the Governor within thirty days  after  receipt  from  the
 
Assembly;  except  that  upon  the filing of a request to hold such bill
with the Temporary President by the sponsor of the bill, the bill  shall
be  held until such time as the sponsor rescinds the request to hold the
bill and upon such rescission the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit
the bill to the Governor within seven days.
 
  RULE IX
 
SENATORS
 
  Section  1.  Attendance  and  vote.  a. Every Senator shall be present
within the Senate Chamber during the sessions of the Senate, unless duly
excused or necessarily prevented, and shall vote on  each  question  for
which  a  vote  is  required stated from the Chair unless excused by the
Senate, or unless he or she has a direct personal or pecuniary  interest
in  the event of such question. A Senator may not refuse to vote, unless
he or she be excused by the Senate, or unless he or she  be  interested.
In  order  to  vote  on a bill on the controversial calendar, a Senator,
other than the Temporary President and  the  Minority  Leader,  must  be
present  in  the  Senate  chamber  and  vote  from  his or her regularly
assigned seat, except that a Senator acting as the Presiding Officer  or
Temporary President may vote from the place assigned to such officer. No
Senator  absent  from a roll call vote shall be allowed to vote thereon;
however, within the same day, a Senator  required  to  attend  a  public
hearing  or  other meeting of a standing or conference committee, or any
other meeting which the Temporary President designates  as  appropriate,
may  cast his or her vote at any time prior to 5 p.m. or the adjournment
of the Senate, whichever shall be later.
 
  b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a  of  this  section,
during  a  declared  period  of  a  state  of  emergency,  the Temporary
President may promulgate  a  policy  allowing  for  Senators  to  be  in
attendance  and  participate  in any proceeding of the Senate, including
voting on any bill on the controversial calendar, by remote means, which
may include  but  shall  not  be  limited  to  teleconference  or  video
conference.  A  technical  failure  resulting  in  the  inadvertent
disconnection  of  any  Senator  or  group  of  Senators  from  Senate
proceedings  shall  not invalidate any action taken by a majority of the
Senators elected.
 
  c. A Senator desiring to be excused from voting for a direct  personal
or  pecuniary interest in the issue then before the Senate may, when his
or her name is called, state such desire and if there  be  an  objection
make  a  brief statement, not occupying over two minutes, of the reasons
for making such request, and the question on excusing him or  her  shall
then  be  taken  without  debate  and shall be granted by the consent of
two-thirds of the Senators present; and any Senator desiring to  explain
his  or  her  vote  upon a bill, may, when his or her name is called, be
allowed a like opportunity.
 
  § 2.  Quorum.  a.  A  majority  of  all  the  Senators  elected  shall
constitute  a quorum to do business. In case a less number than a quorum
of the Senate shall convene, those present are authorized  to  send  the
Sergeant at Arms, or any other person, for the absent Senators.
 
  b. The assent of two-thirds of the Senators elected shall be requisite
to  every  bill appropriating the public moneys or property for local or
private purposes, and to the passage of bills returned by  the  Governor
without his or her approval.
 
  c.  On  the  final  passage  of  any  bill which imposes, continues or
revives a tax, or creates a debt  or  charge,  or  makes,  continues  or
revives  any  appropriation  of  public  or  trust money or property, or
 
releases, discharges or commutes any  claim  or  demand  of  the  State,
three-fifths of all the members elected to the Senate shall be necessary
to constitute a quorum therein.
 
  d.  If, on taking the final question on a bill, it shall appear that a
constitutional quorum is not present, or if the bill requires a vote  of
two-thirds  of  all the Senators elected to pass it, and it appears that
such number is not present, the bill  shall  retain  its  place  on  the
Calendar and be again taken up in its regular order.
 
  e.  When  any  bill  requiring  the  concurrence  of two-thirds of the
Senators, or a quorum of three-fifths thereof, is  under  consideration,
such  concurrence  or quorum, as the case may be, shall not be requisite
except on the question of its final passage.
 
  f. If at any time during the session of the Senate a question shall be
raised by any Senator as to the presence  of  a  quorum,  the  Presiding
Officer shall forthwith direct the Secretary to call the roll, and shall
announce the result, and such proceeding shall be without debate; but no
Senator while speaking shall be interrupted by any other Senator raising
the  question of a lack of a quorum, and the question as to the presence
of a quorum shall not be raised more  often  than  once  in  every  hour
unless  the  lack of a quorum shall be disclosed upon a roll call of the
ayes and nays.
 
  g. Whenever upon a roll call any Senator who is upon the floor of  the
Senate  Chamber refuses to make response when his or her name is called,
it shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer, either upon  his  or  her
own motion or upon the suggestion of any Senator, to request the Senator
so  remaining  silent to respond to his or her name, and if such Senator
fails to do so, the fact of such request and refusal shall be entered in
the journal, and such Senator  shall  be  counted  as  present  for  the
purpose of constituting a quorum.
 
  h.  The  Presiding Officer shall determine whether a member is present
for the purposes of quorum  in  a  manner  consistent  with  any  policy
provided for pursuant to subdivision b of section one of this Rule.
 
  §  3.  Debate.  a. Debate shall only be in order when it is germane to
the question under discussion.
 
  b. If the question in debate contains several points,  a  Senator  may
have  the  same  divided,  provided  the  division called for embodies a
distinct principle or statement of fact.
 
  c. When any bill, resolution or motion is under consideration  and  it
appears  that  no  Senator  desires  to  be heard further, the Presiding
Officer shall put the question: "Does any Senator  desire  to  be  heard
further?"  If  no  Senator  shall  rise to debate, the Presiding Officer
shall declare the debate closed; except  that  thereafter  the  Minority
Leader  may  speak  once,  or may yield the floor to any Senator who may
speak once, and may be followed by the Temporary President who may  also
speak  once,  or  may yield the floor to any Senator who may speak once.
The main question shall then be put immediately.
 
  d. Debate on motions or resolutions other than concurrent  resolutions
shall  be  limited  to  one  hour  with  one-half  hour allocated to the
Majority  Conference  and  one-half  hour  allocated  to  the  Minority
 
Conference.  Debate  upon  any  bill or concurrent resolution shall be
limited to four hours, which  shall  include  sufficient  time  for  all
Senators to explain their votes. No single Senator shall debate any bill
or  concurrent resolution for more than thirty minutes. When any bill or
concurrent resolution shall have been under consideration for two hours,
including all amendments thereto, it shall be in order for  any  Senator
to  move  to close debate, and the Presiding Officer shall recognize the
Senator who wishes to make such motion.  Such  motion  to  close  debate
shall not be amendable or debatable and shall be immediately put, and if
it  shall  receive  the  affirmative  vote of a majority of the Senators
elected, the pending  measure  shall  take  precedence  over  all  other
business.
 
  e.  The  vote  shall  thereupon be taken upon such bill, resolution or
motion with such amendments as may  be  pending  at  the  time  of  such
motion,  according  to  the  Rules  of  the  Senate, but without further
debate, except that upon the roll call the sponsor of a bill before  the
house  may  speak,  not to exceed five minutes, in explanation of his or
her vote, and any Senator, including co-sponsors of the bill before  the
house,  may speak not to exceed two minutes in explanation of his or her
vote. After such motion to close debate has been made by any Senator, no
other motion shall be in order until such motion has been voted upon  by
the Senate.
 
  f.  After the Senate shall have adopted the motion to close debate, as
hereinbefore provided, no motion shall be in order  but  one  motion  to
adjourn  or  for  a call of the Senate by the Temporary President, and a
motion to commit. Should said motion to adjourn be carried, the  measure
under  consideration shall be the pending question when the Senate shall
again convene, and shall be taken up at the point where it  was  at  the
time of such adjournment. The motion to close debate may be ordered upon
a  single  motion,  a series of motions allowable under the rules, or an
amendment or amendments, or  may  be  made  to  embrace  all  authorized
motions or amendments, and include the bill, resolution or motion to its
passage  or  rejection.  All  incidental  questions of order, or motions
pending at the time such motion is made to  close  debate,  whether  the
same be on appeal or otherwise, shall be decided without debate.
 
  §  4.  Order  and  decorum.  a.  Prior  to  the order of business, the
Presiding Officer shall ask those in the  chamber  to  rise  and  pledge
allegiance to the flag. Those in attendance shall remain standing during
the  daily  invocation  and  until  asked  to  take  their  seats by the
Presiding Officer.  Senators shall not interrupt  the  business  of  the
Senate,  or  read  any newspaper while the journals or public papers are
being read; or walk out of or across  the  Chamber  when  the  Presiding
Officer  is  putting  a  question;  or  when a Senator is speaking, pass
between him or her and the Chair. Cellular telephones and audible pagers
shall not be used in the Chamber or Galleries. No sign, placard or  prop
shall  be  displayed,  posted or carried in the Chamber or in the Senate
Galleries. Cellular telephones shall not be used  to  take  photographs,
videos  or  perform  any other recording function in the Senate Chamber,
Galleries or Lobbies without permission of the Secretary of the  Senate,
except  those photographic and recording functions performed by official
Senate photographers and videographers.  Accredited  representatives  of
the press as so designated by the Legislative Correspondents Association
shall be generally authorized to take photographs, videos or perform any
other  recording  function  in  the Senate Chamber, Galleries or Lobbies
unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of  the  Senate.  No  person
 
shall  be  introduced  by  a  Senator during the regular business of the
Senate, except that it shall be permissible to introduce  a  person  who
has served as a member of the New York State Legislature or a person who
is  present in the Chamber for the purpose of nomination to an office to
be confirmed by the Senate.  On the nomination  of  any  person  to  an
office  which  is  subject to the confirmation of the Senate, nominating
and  seconding  speeches  shall  be  limited  to  fifteen  minutes  per
conference.
 
  b. Members are expected to uphold the highest standards of civility in
dealing  with  other  members. Debate should be dignified and lacking in
personal invective. A Senator rising to debate or present  a  paper,  to
give  a  notice, to make a motion or report, shall address the Presiding
Officer and shall not proceed further until recognized by the Chair;  he
or  she  shall  speak on the same subject but twice the same day without
leave of the Senate; and when two or more Senators  address  the  Chair,
the  Presiding  Officer  shall name the Senator who is first to speak. A
Senator, while speaking  after  recognition  by  the  Chair,  may,  upon
request  of  a  Senator, yield to him or her temporarily without thereby
relinquishing his or her prior right to the floor and,  thereafter,  may
terminate  such  interruption and resume speaking at any time; provided,
however, that it shall not be in order for a Senator to rise and request
that a Senator, other than the one with the right to the floor, yield to
a question. Furthermore, it shall not be in order for  a  Senator,  with
the  right  to the floor, to ask another Senator to yield to a question,
unless such Senator has previously  spoken  during  the  debate  on  the
matter. All questions and responses shall be directed through the Chair,
and  the Presiding Officer shall not be interrupted when speaking. After
completion of the order of business for the day, and with the  unanimous
consent  of  the  Senate,  a Senator may make a statement, not exceeding
fifteen minutes in length, concerning a subject or  matter  not  pending
before the Senate for consideration.
 
  c.  When  a Senator shall be called to order, he or she shall take his
or her seat until the Presiding Officer shall have determined whether he
or she is in order or not; and if decided to be out of order, he or  she
shall  not  proceed  without  the  permission  of  the Senate; and every
question of order shall be decided by the Presiding Officer, subject  to
an  appeal to the Senate by any Senator. It shall require an affirmative
vote of a majority of all members elected to overrule a  ruling  of  the
Chair.  No  second  appeal shall be determined until the original appeal
shall be decided; and if a Senator shall be called to  order  for  words
spoken,  the  words  excepted  to  shall  be  immediately  taken down in
writing.
 
  § 5. Presentation of papers. a. A Senator  presenting  a  paper  shall
endorse  the  same with his or her name and a brief written statement of
the subject of its contents.
 
  b. When the reading of a paper is called for,  except  petitions,  and
the same is objected to by any Senator, it shall be determined by a vote
of the Senate, without debate.
 
  § 6. Call of the Senate. For the purpose of securing the attendance of
Senators, a call of the Senate may be ordered at any time, but such call
shall  not  be  in order after the voting on any question has begun, nor
after the third reading of a bill has  been  completed,  nor  after  the
motion  to  close  debate  has been ordered pursuant to section three of
 
this Rule, unless it shall appear upon an actual count by the  Presiding
Officer  that  a  quorum  is  not  present.  The Presiding Officer shall
determine whether a member is present for the  purposes  of  any  quorum
required  by  this  section  in  accordance with any policy provided for
pursuant to subdivision b of section one of this Rule.
 
  § 7. Absences. In all cases of absence of Senators during the sessions
of the Senate, the Temporary President or a  majority  of  the  Senators
elected  may  take  such  measures  as they deem necessary to secure the
presence of the absentees, and in addition to  suspension  for  a  given
period,  may  inflict  such  censure or penalty as they may deem just on
those who shall not render sufficient excuse for their absence.
 
  § 8. Staffing. All Senators shall receive the same base allocation  of
funds  for  staffing  their  offices.  Additional  funding  for
responsibilities associated with  committees  and  leadership  positions
shall be allocated within amounts available for committee and leadership
staff;  such amounts shall include, at a minimum, a budget sufficient to
appoint a staff member with expertise in the committee's subject matter.
The funding for the Minority conference central staff shall not be  less
than  thirty  percent  of  the funds allocated for all central staff and
shall increase or decrease to reflect any changes in the  membership  of
either the Majority Conference or the Minority Conference.
 
  §  9.  Resources.  All  Senators  shall  have  equitable access to the
resources of the Senate, including, but not limited to, office supplies,
communications and audio visual resources, mail  privileges  subject  to
published  guidelines, technology, including both hardware and software,
and  equal  access  to  the  Legislative  Bill  Drafting  Commission's
Legislative Retrieval System.
 
  §  10. District Offices. All Senators will receive funds to maintain a
district office. Rents of district offices shall  be  based  on  a  cost
formula  of  office  rental costs of an equal class of commercial office
space based on the prevailing rent in the community  where  the  Senator
chooses to have his or her district office. A Senator whose district has
geographic  disparities  such that traversing the district is a hardship
for his or her constituents, as determined by the  Temporary  President,
shall receive supplemental funding to maintain a satellite office.
 
  § 11. Allocation for Community Projects. Each conference shall receive
an allocation from any amounts to be awarded by the Senate for community
projects,  capital  spending,  local  assistance  or  other  similar
allocations for member driven initiatives. The Majority Conference shall
receive seventy-one percent of such funds and  the  Minority  Conference
shall  receive  twenty-nine percent of such funds; provided however that
such percentages shall increase or decrease to reflect  any  changes  in
the  membership  of  either  the  Majority  Conference  or  the Minority
Conference.
 
  § 12.  Use  of  legislative  printing,  mail  and  mass  communication
facilities.  a. The use of legislative printing and mail facilities for
newsletters and other forms of mass mailings which  bear  the  names  or
likeness of a candidate in a local, special, primary or general election
shall  be  prohibited within thirty days of such local, special, primary
or  general  election.  Members  may  not  utilize  other  forms  of
senate-funded mass communication media during such thirty-day period.
 
  b.  The  Senate  shall  maintain  a  file  containing  a  copy of each
newsletter provided by Senate facilities, such file shall  be  available
to the public.
 
  c.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  applicable  to  all
communications addressed to the geographic area in which the  member  is
running for election.
