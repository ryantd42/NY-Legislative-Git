 as  amended by section 1 of chapter 2 of the laws of 2012, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. (A) Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the  legis-
 lature  or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen
 hundred fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an expendi-
 ture  of  more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase

 furnishing the required security after advertisement for sealed bids  in
 the  manner  provided  by this section, provided, however, that purchase

 contract pursuant to article eight of the labor law) may be  awarded  on
 the  basis  of best value, as defined in section one hundred sixty-three

 a  public  meeting,  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  HOWEVER,  THAT  FOOD  PURCHASE
 CONTRACTS (INCLUDING CONTRACTS  FOR  SERVICE  WORK,  BUT  EXCLUDING  ANY
 PURCHASE  CONTRACTS  NECESSARY  FOR  THE  COMPLETION  OF  A PUBLIC WORKS
 CONTRACT  PURSUANT  TO ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE LABOR LAW) MAY BE AWARDED TO
 AN OTHERWISE QUALIFIED BIDDER WHO FULFILLS ONE OR  MORE  OF  THE  VALUES
 BASED  PROCUREMENT  STANDARDS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION AND THE  CONTRACT  MAY  BE  GIVEN  PREFERENCE  OVER  OTHER  BIDDERS
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THE COST INCLUDED IN THE BID IS NOT MORE THAN
 TEN PERCENT GREATER THAN THE COST  INCLUDED  IN  A  BID  BY  THE  LOWEST
 RESPONSIBLE  BIDDER  AND  PROVIDED  FURTHER  THAT ALL BIDDERS (INCLUDING
 LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDERS THAT DO NOT UTILIZE THE TEN PERCENT BID BENE-
 FIT) PROVIDE ALL RELEVANT SUPPLY CHAIN DATA IN ITS BID TO THE  APPROPRI-
 ATE  OFFICER,  BOARD  OR  AGENCY, UPDATED ANNUALLY AND UPON CHANGES, AND
 THAT THE APPROPRIATE OFFICER, BOARD  OR  AGENCY  SHALL  MAKE  THIS  DATA
 PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE ENTITIES' RESPECTIVE WEBSITES WITHOUT THE NEED
 FOR  A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW REQUEST, EXCEPTING DATA NOT SUBJECT TO
 DISCLOSURE UNDER THE STATE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW PURSUANT TO  ARTI-
 CLE  SIX  OF  THE  PUBLIC  OFFICERS LAW. In any case where a responsible
 bidder's or responsible offerer's gross price is reducible by an  allow-
 ance  for  the value of used machinery, equipment, apparatus or tools to
 be traded in by a  political  subdivision,  the  gross  price  shall  be
 reduced  by the amount of such allowance, for the purpose of determining
 the best value.  In cases where two or more responsible bidders furnish-
 ing the required security submit identical bids as to price, such  offi-
 cer, board or agency may award the contract to any of such bidders. Such
 officer,  board  or  agency may, in his or her or its discretion, reject
 all bids or offers and readvertise for new bids or offers in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section.  In  determining  whether  a purchase is an
 expenditure within the discretionary threshold  amounts  established  by
 this  subdivision,  the officer, board or agency of a political subdivi-
 sion or of any district therein shall consider the  reasonably  expected
 aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or
 technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the
 date  of  purchase.  Purchases  of commodities, services or technology
 shall not be artificially divided for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the
 discretionary  buying  thresholds  established  by  this  subdivision. A
 change to or a renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be  permit-
 ted  if the change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected aggre-
 gate amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or  tech-
 nology  from the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing
 on the date of the first purchase to an amount greater than the  discre-
 tionary  buying  threshold amount. For purposes of this section, "sealed
 bids" and "sealed offers", as that term applies to  purchase  contracts,
 (including  contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant to article eight of the labor law) shall  include  bids  and  offers
 submitted  in an electronic format including submission of the statement
 of non-collusion required by section one hundred three-d of  this  arti-
 cle,  provided  that the governing board of the political subdivision or
 district, by resolution, has authorized the receipt of bids  and  offers
 in  such  format.  Submission  in  electronic format may, for technology
 contracts only, be required as the sole method  for  the  submission  of
 bids and offers. Bids and offers submitted in an electronic format shall
 be  transmitted  by  bidders and offerers to the receiving device desig-
 nated by the political subdivision  or  district.  Any  method  used  to
 receive  electronic  bids  and offers shall comply with article three of
 S. 6955  3
 
 the state technology law, and any rules and regulations promulgated  and
 guidelines  developed thereunder and, at a minimum, must [(a)] (I) docu-
 ment the time and date of receipt of each bid and offer  received  elec-
 tronically;  [(b)]  (II)  authenticate the identity of the sender; [(c)]
 (III) ensure the security of the information transmitted; and [(d)] (IV)
 ensure the confidentiality of the bid or offer until the time  and  date
 established  for the opening of bids or offers. The timely submission of
 an electronic bid or offer in compliance with instructions provided  for
 such submission in the advertisement for bids or offers and/or the spec-
 ifications  shall be the responsibility solely of each bidder or offerer
 or prospective bidder or offerer. No political subdivision  or  district
 therein shall incur any liability from delays of or interruptions in the
 receiving device designated for the submission and receipt of electronic
 bids and offers.
  (B)  ALL  SUPPLIER  DATA, INCLUDING SOURCING DATA FROM SUBCONTRACTORS,
 SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE ENTITY SENDING OUT THE REQUEST  FOR  PROPOSALS
 AT  THE  TIME  OF  BID,  TO THE BEST OF THE BIDDER'S ABILITY, UPDATED AT
