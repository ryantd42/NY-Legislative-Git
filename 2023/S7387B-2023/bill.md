  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that both with-
 in  the  city  of  New  York and across the United States, over the past
 several decades, income inequality has  expanded  and  that  poverty  is
 frequently  concentrated  in  economically  disadvantaged regions.  The
 legislature also finds that economic disparities among  individuals  and
 across  communities have further expanded due to the economic and health
 effects of the virus known as COVID-19.  The purpose of this legislation
 is to remediate these economic disparities by authorizing  the  city  of
 New York, the city school district of the city of New York, the New York
 city  school construction authority, the New York city health and hospi-
 tals corporation, the New York city industrial development  agency,  and
 other  city-affiliated  not-for-profit  corporations to use the economic
 power of their transactions to implement programs by administrative rule
 requiring contractors and subcontractors benefitting  from  such  trans-
 actions  to make best efforts to employ qualified economically disadvan-
