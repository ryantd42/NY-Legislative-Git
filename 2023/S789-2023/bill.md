 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of any other general, special or

 GENERAL MUNICIPAL LAW to audit courses given  therein  without  tuition,

 AMBULANCE WORKER THAT IS CURRENTLY ENROLLED AS A FULL-TIME OR  PART-TIME
 STUDENT  IN  SUCH  INSTITUTION OR THAT LATER BECOMES ENROLLED AS A FULL-
 TIME OR PART-TIME STUDENT IN SUCH INSTITUTION.
