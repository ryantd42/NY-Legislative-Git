 Introduced  by Sen. GALLIVAN -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to elim-
  inating the requirement that hunters wear  back  tags  during  hunting
  season  in  the  state;  and  to repeal certain provisions of such law
  relating thereto
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 11-0705 of the environmental conservation law, as
 amended by section 21 of part R of chapter 58 of the laws  of  2013,  is
 amended to read as follows:
 § 11-0705. Failure  to  carry  license, tag or bowhunting and/or muzzle-
  loading privileges.
  1. a. The holder of a license, tag, bowhunting  privilege  or  muzzle-
 loading privilege defined in section 11-0701 of this title shall:
  (1)  have  such license, tag or privilege on the holder's person while
 exercising any privilege of that license stated in  section  11-0701  of
 this  title,  or  while  assisting or accompanying a minor in hunting as
 provided in section 11-0929 of this article, and
  (2) shall exhibit it on demand to any police officer, peace officer or
 owner, lessee or person in control of the lands or waters or the  desig-
 nees of the owner, lessee or person in control of the lands or waters on
 which the license holder is present.
  2. [a. Holders of a hunting license while exercising the privileges of
 such license, shall have the back tag issued with their license attached
 to  and displayed on the back of the outer garment between the shoulders
 in such manner that all figures are plainly visible at all times.
  b. The license tag for the current year only shall be displayed.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  c. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs a and b of this subdi-
 vision, a license holder shall not be required to display  such  license
 tag in the Northern Zone or the Catskill Park.
  3.] Failure of a licensee to have the holder's license, tag or license
 with  bowhunting  and/or muzzle-loading privilege included, on the hold-
 er's person while hunting, fishing or trapping, is presumptive  evidence
 that  the  holder  is  hunting, fishing or trapping, as the case may be,
 without holding the license, tag or license and  bowhunting  or  muzzle-
 loading  privilege  required by subdivision 6 of section 11-0703 of this
 title.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 71-0923 of the  environmental  conserva-
 tion law is REPEALED.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
