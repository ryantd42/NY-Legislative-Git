 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  BRAUNSTEIN  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Mental Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the mental hygiene law, in relation to  hospitalization,
  care  coordination, and assisted outpatient treatment for persons with
  mental illness
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as "The Supportive
 Interventions Act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The legislature finds that with proper
 support, the great majority of New Yorkers with  severe  mental  illness
 can  thrive  in  outpatient  settings as fully-integrated members of the
 communities of our state.
  The legislature further finds that  a  core  function  of  our  mental
 health system is to help each person with severe mental illness maximize
 their potential for a self-directed life. Fulfilling this responsibility
 requires a flexible approach that acknowledges the challenges that indi-
 viduals  with  severe  mental  illness  may face at certain junctures in
 recognizing their own illness and  need  for  treatment.  To  empower  a
 person  to  gain  command  of  their  own  mental health recovery in due
 course, it is sometimes necessary to extend a lifeline through a  period
 of mandated treatment.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  it is always preferable for an
 individual in psychiatric crisis or at risk  thereof  to  accept  mental
 health  treatment  voluntarily, and that care providers be encouraged to
 make diligent efforts to exhaust such possibilities before resorting  to
 involuntary care.
  The  legislature  further  finds that while New York law appropriately
 limits involuntary hospitalization to  circumstances  where  a  person's
 mental  illness  is deemed "likely to result in serious harm," a lack of
 statutory guidance has led to tragically narrow interpretations of  this
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 standard. The serious harm likely to result from egregious self-neglect,
 including  psychiatric  deterioration  likely to result from an extended
 period of untreated psychosis, is too often not considered in the  clin-
 ical evaluation of those in crisis.
  The  legislature  further  finds  individuals  not receiving essential
 mental health care because they are unable to recognize their  own  need
 for  it may face "revolving door" hospitalization, and intolerable rates
 of victimization and premature death.
  The legislature further finds that while  assisted  outpatient  treat-
 ment,  as  established by "Kendra's Law" in 1999, has been highly effec-
 tive in helping New Yorkers with severe mental illness  live  safely  in
 the  community  and  avoid hospitalization and criminal justice involve-
 ment, gaps and barriers in the law have prevented the  participation  of
 many  individuals  who  meet the legal eligibility criteria and stand to
 benefit from this essential intervention.
  The legislature intends and expects that the supportive  interventions
 facilitated  by  this act will save lives, raise the quality of life for
 New Yorkers with severe mental illness and  their  loved  ones,  enhance
 public safety, reduce criminalization of mental illness, and improve the
 efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our public mental health system.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  there  is no choice to be made
 between the reforms enacted herein and the additional need  to  increase
 investments  in community-based mental health. Ongoing efforts to expand
 availability of mental health treatment and services,  supportive  hous-
 ing,  and  opportunities  for social connection must continue, and offer
 great promise to reduce the need  for  the  crisis  response  mechanisms
 addressed in this act.
  § 3. Section 9.01 of the mental hygiene law, as amended by chapter 723
 of  the  laws  of 1989, the seventh undesignated paragraph as amended by

 examination. All certificates shall contain the facts and  circumstances
 upon  which the judgment of the physicians OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMIN-
 ERS is based and shall show that the condition of the person examined is
 such that he OR SHE needs involuntary care and treatment in a  hospital,
 and  such  other  information  as  the  commissioner  may  by regulation
 require.
  § 6. The section heading and subdivisions (a), (d), (e),  and  (i)  of
 section  9.27  of  the mental hygiene law, section 9.27 as renumbered by
 chapter 978 of the laws of 1977 and subdivision (i) as amended by  chap-
 ter 847 of the laws of 1987, are amended to read as follows:
  Involuntary admission on [medical] CLINICAL certification.
  (a)  The  director  of  a hospital may receive and retain therein as a
 patient any person alleged to be mentally ill and in need of involuntary
 care and treatment upon the certificates of  two  examining  physicians,
 TWO  EXAMINING QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINERS OR A COMBINATION OF AN EXAM-
 INING PHYSICIAN AND AN EXAMINING QUALIFIED CLINICAL  EXAMINER,  accompa-
 nied by an application for the admission of such person. The examination
 may be conducted jointly but each examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLIN-
 ICAL EXAMINER shall execute a separate certificate.
  (d)  Before  an  examining  physician  OR  QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 completes the certificate of examination of  a  person  for  involuntary
 care  and  treatment,  [he] THE PHYSICIAN OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 shall consider alternative forms of care and  treatment  that  might  be
 adequate to provide for the person's needs without requiring involuntary
 hospitalization.  If the examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAM-
 INER knows that the person he OR SHE is examining for  involuntary  care
 and  treatment  has been under prior treatment, he OR SHE shall, insofar
 as [possible] REASONABLE, consult with the physician  or  [psychologist]
 QUALIFIED  MENTAL  HEALTH  PROFESSIONAL  furnishing such prior treatment
 prior to completing [his] THE certificate. Nothing in this section shall
 prohibit or invalidate any involuntary admission made in accordance with
 the provisions of this chapter.
  (e) The director of the hospital where such person  is  brought  shall
 cause  such  person to be examined forthwith by a physician OR QUALIFIED
 CLINICAL EXAMINER who shall be a member of the psychiatric staff of such
 hospital other than the original examining physicians OR QUALIFIED CLIN-
 ICAL EXAMINER whose certificate or certificates accompanied the applica-
 tion, and[,] if such person is found to be in need of  involuntary  care
 and  treatment, he OR SHE may be admitted thereto as a patient as herein
 provided.
  (i) After an application for  the  admission  of  a  person  has  been
 completed and both physicians OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINERS have exam-
 ined such person and separately certified that he or she is mentally ill
 and  in  need  of  involuntary  care and treatment in a hospital, either
 physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER is authorized to request  peace
 officers,  when acting pursuant to their special duties, or police offi-
 cers[,] who are members of an authorized police department or  force  or
 of  a  sheriff's  department,  to  take  into custody and transport such
 person to a hospital for determination  by  the  director  whether  such
 person  qualifies  for  admission  pursuant  to  this  section. Upon the
 A. 7827  5
 
 request of either physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, an ambulance
 service, as defined by subdivision two of section three thousand one  of
 the  public  health  law,  is  authorized  to transport such person to a
 hospital for determination by the director whether such person qualifies
 for admission pursuant to this section.
  §  7.  The  section heading and subdivision (a) of section 9.29 of the

  Involuntary admission on [medical] CLINICAL  certification;  patient's
 right to a hearing.
  (a)  If,  at  any  time prior to the expiration of sixty days from the
 date of involuntary admission of a patient on an  application  supported
 by  [medical]  CLINICAL certification, [he] SUCH PATIENT or any relative
 or friend, or the mental hygiene legal service gives notice  in  writing
 to  the  director  of  A request for hearing on the question of need for
 involuntary care and treatment,  a  hearing  shall  be  held  as  herein
 provided.  The  patient  or person requesting a hearing on behalf of the
 patient may designate the county where the hearing shall be held,  which
 shall  be either in the county where the hospital is located, the county
 of the patient's residence, or the county in which the hospital to which
 the patient was first admitted is located. Such hearing shall be held in
 the county so designated,  subject  to  application  by  any  interested
 party,  including  the director, for change of venue to any other county
 because of the convenience of parties or witnesses or the  condition  of
 the patient upon notice to the persons required to be served with notice
 of the patient's initial admission.
  §  9.  Subdivision  (a)  of section 9.33 of the mental hygiene law, as

 follows:
  (a)  If  the  director shall determine that a patient admitted upon an
 application supported by  [medical]  CLINICAL  certification,  for  whom
 there is no court order authorizing retention for a specified period, is
 in  need  of  retention  and if such patient does not agree to remain in
 such hospital as a voluntary patient, the director shall  apply  to  the
 supreme  court  or  the county court in the county where the hospital is
 located for an order authorizing continued retention.  Such  application
 shall  be  made  no  later  than sixty days from the date of involuntary
 admission on application supported by [medical]  CLINICAL  certification
 or  thirty  days  from  the  date of an order denying an application for
 patient's release pursuant to section 9.31 OF THIS ARTICLE, whichever is
 later; and the hospital is authorized to retain  the  patient  for  such
 further  period  during  which  the  hospital is authorized to make such
 application or during which the application may be pending. The director
 shall cause written notice of  such  application  to  be  given  TO  the
 patient  and  a copy thereof shall be given personally or by mail to the
 persons required by this article  to  be  served  with  notice  of  such
 A. 7827  6
 
 patient's  initial  admission  and  to the mental hygiene legal service.
 Such notice shall state that a hearing may be requested and that failure
 to make such a request within five days, excluding Sunday and  holidays,
 from  the  date that the notice was given to the patient will permit the
 entry without a hearing of an order authorizing retention.
  § 10. The section heading and subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e)
 of section 9.37 of the mental hygiene law, section 9.37 as renumbered by
 chapter 978 of the laws of 1977, subdivision (a) as amended  by  chapter

 amended to read as follows:
  Involuntary  admission  on  certificate  of  a  director  of community
 services or [his] DIRECTOR'S designee.
  (a) The director of a hospital, upon  application  by  a  director  of
 community services or an examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAM-
 INER duly designated by [him or her] SUCH DIRECTOR, may receive and care
 for  in such hospital as a patient any person who, in the opinion of the
 director of community services or the director's designee, has a  mental
 illness  for  which immediate inpatient care and treatment in a hospital
 is appropriate and [which] THAT, WITHOUT TREATMENT, is likely to  result
 in serious harm to [himself or herself] SELF or others.
  The need for immediate hospitalization shall be confirmed by a [staff]
 physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL EXAMINER ON THE STAFF of the hospital
 prior to admission. Within seventy-two hours, excluding Sunday and holi-
 days, after such admission, if such patient is to be retained  for  care
 and treatment beyond such time and he or she does not agree to remain in
 such hospital as a voluntary patient, the certificate of another examin-
 ing  physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER who is a member of the
 psychiatric staff of the hospital that the patient is in need of  invol-
 untary  care  and  treatment  shall be filed with the hospital. From the
 time of his or her admission under this section the  retention  of  such
 patient  for  care  and treatment shall be subject to the provisions for
 notice, hearing, review, and judicial approval of continued retention or
 transfer and continued retention provided by this article for the admis-
 sion and retention of  involuntary  patients,  provided  that,  for  the
 purposes  of such provisions, the date of admission of the patient shall
 be deemed to be the date when the patient  was  first  received  in  the
 hospital under this section.
  (b)  The  application  for  admission  of  a  patient pursuant to this
 section shall be based upon a personal  examination  by  a  director  of
 community  services  or  [his]  THE  DIRECTOR'S designee. It shall be in
 writing and shall be filed with the director of  such  hospital  at  the
 time  of  the  patient's  reception, together with a statement in a form
 prescribed by the commissioner  giving  such  information  as  [he]  THE
 COMMISSIONER may deem appropriate.
  (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (b)  of [this]
 section 41.09 OF THIS CHAPTER, in counties with  a  population  of  less
 than  two  hundred  thousand,  a director of community services who is a
 licensed psychologist pursuant to article one hundred fifty-three of the
 education law or a licensed clinical social worker pursuant  to  article
 one  hundred  fifty-four of the education law but who is not a physician
 OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER may apply for the admission of a  patient
 pursuant  to this section without [a medical] AN examination by a desig-
 nated physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, if a  hospital  approved
 A. 7827  7
 
 by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section 9.39 of this article is not
 located within thirty miles of the patient, and the director of communi-
 ty services has made a reasonable effort to  locate  [a  designated]  AN
 examining  physician  OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER DESIGNATED PURSUANT
 TO SECTION 41.09 OF THIS CHAPTER but such [a] designee is not immediate-
 ly available and the director  of  community  services,  after  personal
 observation of the person, reasonably believes that [he] SUCH PERSON may
 have  a  mental illness [which] THAT is likely to result in serious harm
 to [himself] SELF or others and inpatient care  and  treatment  of  such
 person  in a hospital may be appropriate. In the event of an application
 pursuant to this subdivision, a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 of the receiving hospital shall examine the patient and shall not  admit
 the  patient  unless  he or she determines that the patient has a mental
 illness for which immediate inpatient care and treatment in  a  hospital
 is  appropriate  and [which] THAT is likely to result in serious harm to
 [himself] SELF or others. If the  patient  is  admitted,  the  need  for
 hospitalization shall be confirmed by another [staff] physician OR QUAL-
 IFIED  CLINICAL EXAMINER ON THE STAFF OF THE HOSPITAL within twenty-four
 hours. An application pursuant to this subdivision shall be  in  writing
 and shall be filed with the director of such hospital at the time of the
 patient's  reception,  together with a statement in a form prescribed by
 the commissioner giving such information as [he]  THE  COMMISSIONER  may
 deem  appropriate,  including  a  statement  of  the efforts made by the
 director of community services to locate a designated  examining  physi-
 cian  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER  prior  to making an application
 pursuant to this subdivision.
  (d) After signing the application, the director of community  services
 or  the  director's  designee  shall be authorized and empowered to take
 into custody, detain, transport, and provide temporary care for any such
 person. Upon the written [request] DIRECTIVE of  such  director  or  the
 director's  designee it shall be the duty of peace officers, when acting
 pursuant to their special duties, or police officers who are members  of
 the  state police or of an authorized police department or force or of a
 sheriff's department, to take into custody and transport any such person
 as [requested and] directed by such director or designee. Upon the writ-
 ten request of such director  or  designee,  an  ambulance  service,  as
 defined  in  subdivision two of section three thousand one of the public
 health law, is authorized to transport any such person.
  (e) Reasonable expenses incurred by the director of  community  mental
 hygiene  services  or  [his] THE DIRECTOR'S designee for the examination
 and temporary care of the patient and [his] SUCH  PATIENT'S  transporta-
 tion  to  and  from  the hospital shall be a charge upon the county from
 which the patient was admitted and shall be paid from any  funds  avail-
 able for such purposes.
  §  11.  Subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 9.39 of the mental hygiene
 law, subdivision (a) as amended by chapter 789 of the laws of  1985  and
 such  section  as  renumbered  by  chapter  978 of the laws of 1977, are
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) The director of any hospital maintaining adequate staff and facil-
 ities for the observation, examination, care, and treatment  of  persons
 alleged  to  be mentally ill and approved by the commissioner to receive
 and retain patients pursuant to this  section  may  receive  and  retain
 therein  as a patient for a period of fifteen days any person alleged to
 have a mental illness for which immediate observation, care, and  treat-
 ment  in  a hospital is appropriate and [which] THAT is likely to result
 A. 7827  8
 
 in serious harm to [himself] SELF or others. ["Likelihood to  result  in
 serious harm" as used in this article shall mean:
  1.  substantial  risk  of  physical  harm  to himself as manifested by
 threats of or attempts at  suicide  or  serious  bodily  harm  or  other
 conduct demonstrating that he is dangerous to himself, or
  2.  a substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested
 by homicidal or other violent behavior by which  others  are  placed  in
 reasonable fear of serious physical harm.]
  The  director  shall cause to be entered upon the hospital records the
 name of the person or persons, if any, who have brought such  person  to
 the  hospital and the details of the circumstances leading to the hospi-
 talization of such person.
  The director shall admit such person pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 this  section only if a [staff] physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 ON THE STAFF of the hospital upon examination of such person finds  that
 such  person  qualifies  under  the  requirements  of this section. Such
 person shall not be retained for a period of more than forty-eight hours
 unless within such period such finding is confirmed after examination by
 another physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER who shall be  a  member
 of  the  psychiatric staff of the hospital. Such person shall be served,
 at the time of admission, with written notice  of  [his]  SUCH  PERSON'S
 status  and  rights  as  a patient under this section. Such notice shall
 contain the patient's name. At the same time, such notice shall also  be
 given  to  the mental hygiene legal service and personally or by mail to
 such person or persons, not to exceed three in number, as may be  desig-
 nated  in  writing  to  receive  such notice by the person alleged to be
 mentally ill. If at any time after admission, the patient, any relative,
 friend, or the mental hygiene legal service gives notice to the director
 in writing of request for court hearing on  the  question  of  need  for
 immediate  observation,  care, and treatment, a hearing shall be held as
 herein provided as soon as practicable but in any event  not  more  than
 five  days  after such request is received, except that the commencement
 of such hearing may be adjourned at the request of the patient. It shall
 be the duty of the director upon receiving notice of  such  request  for
 hearing  to forward forthwith a copy of such notice with a record of the
 patient to the supreme court or county court in the  county  where  such
 hospital  is  located.  A  copy  of such notice and record shall also be
 given the mental hygiene legal service. The court [which] THAT  receives
 such  notice shall fix the date of such hearing and cause the patient or
 other person requesting the hearing, the director,  the  mental  hygiene
 legal  service  and  such other persons as the court may determine to be
 advised of such date. Upon such date, or upon such other date  to  which
 the  proceeding  may  be  adjourned,  the court shall hear testimony and
 examine the person alleged to be mentally ill, if it be deemed advisable
 in or out of court, and shall render a decision in writing that there is
 reasonable cause to believe that the patient has a  mental  illness  for
 which  immediate inpatient care and treatment in a hospital is appropri-
 ate and [which] THAT is likely to result in serious  harm  to  [himself]
 SELF or others. If it be determined that there is such reasonable cause,
 the  court  shall  forthwith issue an order authorizing the retention of
 such patient for any such purpose or purposes  in  the  hospital  for  a
 period  not  to exceed fifteen days from the date of admission. Any such
 order entered by the court shall not be deemed  to  be  an  adjudication
 that the patient is mentally ill, but only a determination that there is
 reasonable cause to retain the patient for the purposes of this section.
 A. 7827  9
 
  (b) Within fifteen days of arrival at the hospital, if a determination
 is  made  that  the person is not in need of involuntary care and treat-
 ment, [he] SUCH PERSON shall  be  discharged  unless  [he]  SUCH  PERSON
 agrees to remain as a voluntary or informal patient. If [he] SUCH PERSON
 is  in  need  of  involuntary  care  and treatment and does not agree to
 remain as a voluntary or informal  patient,  [he]  SUCH  PERSON  may  be
 retained beyond such fifteen day period only by admission to such hospi-
 tal or another appropriate hospital pursuant to the provisions governing
 involuntary  admission  on  application  supported by [medical] CLINICAL
 certification and subject to the provisions for notice, hearing, review,
 and judicial approval of retention or transfer and  retention  governing
 such admissions, provided that, for the purposes of such provisions, the
 date of admission of the patient shall be deemed to be the date when the
 patient  was  first  received  under this section. If a hearing has been
 requested pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a), the  filing  of
 an  application  for involuntary admission on [medical] CLINICAL certif-
 ication shall not delay or prevent the holding of the hearing.
  § 12. Subdivisions (a-1), (b), and (c) of section 9.40 of  the  mental
 hygiene law, subdivisions (a-1) as added and (b) as amended by section 2
 of  part  PPP  of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, and subdivision (c) as

 holidays.  Adjournments shall be permitted only for good cause shown. In
 granting adjournments, the court shall consider  the  need  for  further

 the  petition  meets each of the criteria for assisted outpatient treat-
 ment.
  (3) If the subject of the petition has refused to  be  examined  by  a
 physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER,  the court may request the
 subject to consent to an examination by a physician OR  QUALIFIED  CLIN-
 ICAL  EXAMINER  appointed  by  the court. If the subject of the petition
 does not consent and the court finds reasonable cause  to  believe  that
 the  allegations  in  the  petition  are true, the court may order peace
 officers, acting pursuant to their special duties,  or  police  officers
 who  are  members of an authorized police department or force[,] or of a
 sheriff's department to take the subject of the  petition  into  custody
 and transport him or her to a hospital for examination by a physician OR

 FIED CLINICAL EXAMINER whose affirmation or  affidavit  accompanied  the
 petition pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision (e) of this section,
 if  such  physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER is privileged by such
 hospital or otherwise authorized by such hospital  to  do  so.  If  such
 examination is performed by another physician[, the examining physician]
 OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER,  SUCH PHYSICIAN OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL
 EXAMINER may consult with the physician OR QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER
 whose  affirmation  or  affidavit accompanied the petition as to whether
 the subject meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment.
  (4) A physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER who testifies  pursuant
 to  paragraph  two  of this subdivision shall state[: (i)] the facts AND
 CONCLUSIONS which support the allegation that the subject meets each  of
 the  criteria  for  assisted outpatient treatment[, (ii)] AND that [the]
 ASSISTED OUTPATIENT treatment is  the  least  restrictive  alternative[,
 (iii)  the  recommended  assisted  outpatient  treatment,  and  (iv) the
 rationale for the recommended  assisted  outpatient  treatment.  If  the
 recommended  assisted  outpatient  treatment  includes  medication, such
 physician's testimony shall describe the types or classes of  medication
 which  should  be  authorized,  shall describe the beneficial and detri-
 mental physical and mental effects of such medication, and shall  recom-
 mend whether such medication should be self-administered or administered
 by authorized personnel].
  §  25.  Subdivision  (i) of section 9.60 of the mental hygiene law, as
 amended by chapter 158 of the laws  of  2005,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (i)  Written  treatment  plan.  (1) The court shall not order assisted
 outpatient treatment unless a physician OR PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITION-
 ER appointed by the appropriate  director,  in  consultation  with  such
 director,  develops  and provides to the court a proposed written treat-
 ment plan. The written treatment  plan  shall  include  case  management
 services  or assertive community treatment team services to provide care
 coordination. The written treatment plan also shall include all  catego-
 ries  of  services,  as set forth in paragraph one of subdivision (a) of
 this section, which such physician  OR  PSYCHIATRIC  NURSE  PRACTITIONER
 recommends that the subject of the petition receive. All service provid-
 ers shall be notified regarding their inclusion in the written treatment
 plan.  If the written treatment plan includes medication, it shall state
 whether such medication should be self-administered or  administered  by
 authorized personnel, and shall specify type and dosage range of medica-
 tion  most  likely  to  provide  maximum benefit for the subject. If the
 written treatment plan includes alcohol or  substance  abuse  counseling
 and  treatment,  such  plan  may  include a provision requiring relevant
 testing for either alcohol or illegal  substances  provided  the  physi-
 cian's OR PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER'S clinical basis for recommend-
 ing  such  plan provides sufficient facts for the court to find (i) that
 such person has a history of alcohol or substance abuse  that  is  clin-
 ically  related  to  the  mental  illness; and (ii) that such testing is
 necessary to prevent a relapse or deterioration [which]  THAT  would  be
 likely  to  result  in serious harm to [the person] SELF or others. If a
 director is the petitioner, the written treatment plan shall be provided
 to the court no later than the date of the hearing on the petition. If a
 person other than a director is  the  petitioner,  such  plan  shall  be
 provided  to  the court no later than the date set by the court pursuant
 to paragraph three of subdivision (j) of this section.

 plan:  the  subject of the petition; the treating physician, if any; and
 upon  the  request of the subject of the petition, an individual signif-
 icant to the subject including any relative, close friend or  individual
 otherwise  concerned  with the welfare of the subject. If the subject of
 the petition has executed a health care proxy, the  appointed  physician
 OR PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER shall consider any directions included
 in such proxy in developing the written treatment plan.
  (3)  The  court shall not order assisted outpatient treatment unless a
 physician OR PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER appearing  on  behalf  of  a
 director testifies IN PERSON OR BY VIDEO CONFERENCE to explain the writ-
 ten  proposed treatment plan; PROVIDED THAT SUCH TESTIMONY SHALL ONLY BE
 PERMITTED BY VIDEO CONFERENCE UPON CONSENT OF THE SUBJECT OF  THE  PETI-

 clinical judgment of a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, (i) the

 outpatient  treatment, (ii) efforts were made to solicit compliance, and
 (iii) such assisted outpatient may be in need of  involuntary  admission
 to  a  hospital  pursuant  to  section 9.27 of this article or immediate
 observation, care and treatment pursuant to section 9.39 or 9.40 of this
 article, such physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER may  request  the
 appropriate  director of community services, the director's designee, or
 any physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER designated by the  director
 of  community  services  pursuant  to  section  9.37 of this article, to
 direct the removal of such assisted outpatient to an appropriate  hospi-
 tal  for an examination to determine if such person has a mental illness
 for which hospitalization is necessary pursuant to section 9.27, 9.39 or
 9.40 of this article. Furthermore, if such assisted  outpatient  refuses
 to take medications as required by the court order, or he or she refuses
 to  take,  or fails a blood test, urinalysis, or alcohol or drug test as
 required by the court order, such physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL  EXAM-
 INER  may  consider such refusal or failure when determining whether the
 assisted outpatient is in need of an examination to determine whether he
 or she has a mental illness for which hospitalization is necessary. Upon
 the request of such physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, the appro-
 priate director, the director's designee, or any physician OR  QUALIFIED
 CLINICAL  EXAMINER  designated pursuant to section 9.37 of this article,
 may direct peace officers, acting pursuant to their special  duties,  or
 police  officers  who  are members of an authorized police department or
 force or of a sheriff's department to take the assisted outpatient  into
 custody  and transport him or her to the hospital operating the assisted
 outpatient treatment program or to any hospital authorized by the direc-
 tor of community services to receive such persons. Such law  enforcement
 officials  shall  carry  out  such  directive.  Upon the request of such
 A. 7827  19
 
 physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, the appropriate director,  the
 director's  designee,  or  any  physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 designated pursuant to  section  9.37  of  this  article,  an  ambulance
 service,  as defined by subdivision two of section three thousand one of
 the public health law, or an approved mobile crisis  outreach  team,  as
 defined  in  section  9.58  of this article, shall be authorized to take
 into custody and transport any such person to the hospital operating the
 assisted outpatient treatment program, or to any other hospital  author-
 ized  by  the appropriate director of community services to receive such
 persons. Any director of  community  services,  or  designee,  shall  be
 authorized  to direct the removal of an assisted outpatient who is pres-
 ent in his or her county to an appropriate hospital, in accordance  with
 the  provisions  of  this subdivision, based upon a determination of the
 appropriate  director  of  community  services  OR  DIRECTOR'S  DESIGNEE
 directing  the  removal  of  such  assisted  outpatient pursuant to this
 subdivision. Such person may  be  retained  for  observation,  care  and
 treatment  and further examination in the hospital for up to seventy-two
 hours to permit a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER to  determine
 whether  such  person has a mental illness and is in need of involuntary
 care and treatment in a hospital pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this
 article. Any continued involuntary retention in such hospital beyond the
 initial  seventy-two  hour  period  shall  be  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions of this article relating to  the  involuntary  admission  and
 retention of a person. If at any time during the seventy-two hour period
 the  person  is  determined  not  to  meet the involuntary admission and
 retention provisions of this article, and does not agree to stay in  the
 hospital as a voluntary or informal patient, he or she must be released.
 Failure  to  comply with an order of assisted outpatient treatment shall
 not be grounds for involuntary civil commitment or a finding of contempt
 of court.
