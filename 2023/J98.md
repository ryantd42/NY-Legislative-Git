  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Minority Health Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months that are set aside to increase awareness of issues that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April  2023,  as  Minority
Health Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  York  State Office of Minority Health and Health
Disparities Prevention (OMH-HDP) was established in 1992 by an amendment
to the New York State Public Health Law to focus on the health  concerns
of minorities in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  OMH-HDP is dedicated to improving the health of racial and
ethnic minority populations through the development of  health  policies
and programs that will help eliminate health disparities; and
 
  WHEREAS, When comparing their health indicators against those of the
rest  of  the United States population, poor health outcomes for African
Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska  Natives,  Asian
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders are apparent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  populations  experience higher rates of illness and
death from health conditions such as  heart  disease,  stroke,  specific
cancers,  diabetes,  HIV/AIDS,  asthma,  hepatitis B, and overweight and
obesity; and
 
  WHEREAS, OMH-HDP's primary responsibility is to serve as a statewide
resource for effecting the elimination of health disparities across  all
impacted  populations by ensuring that everyone, regardless of ethnic or
racial background or the community to which they belong, has  access  to
the resources and services they need to be healthy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  OMH-HDP's  programs  address  disease  prevention,  health
promotion, risk reduction, healthier lifestyle choices,  use  of  health
care services, and barriers to health care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  OMH-HDP  works  in  partnership  with  communities  and
organizations in the public and private  sectors;  these  collaborations
support  a  systems  approach  for  eliminating  health disparities, and
coordinated responses through focused initiatives; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be  greater public awareness of
this health issue, and more must be done to  increase  activity  at  the
local,  State  and  national  levels  to  improve  health and healthcare
outcomes for racial and ethnic minority communities; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April  2023,  as  Minority
Health Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
