  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Hip-Hop Against  Gun  &  Gang  Violence
  Month in the State of New York
 
  LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
May  2023,  as Hip-Hop Against Gun & Gang Violence Month in the State of
New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations  and  individuals  that  are devoted to the welfare of the
community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to increase awareness of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May 2023, as Hip-Hop
Against Gun &  Gang  Violence  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Hip-Hop  Against Gun &
Violence Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The artform  of  Hip-Hop  has  become  intrinsic  with  the
development  of  sophisticated critiques against social injustice due to
its proximity to youth culture, especially in  underserved  populations;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Because  Hip-Hop, as a medium, exposes the destructiveness
of issues such as gang and gun violence, racism, and  police  brutality,
it  invites  each  successive  generation  to take part in the discourse
about how to rise above these issues; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hip-Hop  has  provided  opportunities  for  extracurricular
activities,  youth  counseling,  creative  outlets,  physical  fitness,
vocabulary  exercises,  poetry,  analytical  thinking,  entertainment,
employment,  and  economic  impact,  and  has  become  an  industry that
generates more than a billion dollars annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in July 2001 by Charles Fisher, the Hip-Hop  Summit
Youth  Council (HHSYC) was created to help implement commitments made by
record companies, artists, community leaders and  elected  officials  at
the historic 2001 Hip-Hop Summit at the Hilton Hotel in New York City to
improve  youth  social,  political,  and economic conditions in schools,
homes, and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the HHSYC diligently work to teach students  and
young  adults  the  dire  consequences of gun and gang violence and work
with  them  to  find  solutions  to  improve  public  safety  in  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With the power of students, millennials, and young adults,
along with celebrities, social media, film, television, and  music,  the
agency  actively  seeks  and implements solutions to save young lives in
the U.S.  and abroad; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the  number  one  non-profit,  social service, hip-hop
organization in the  world,  they  launched  a  groundbreaking  "Call  2
Action"  app with "The People's Shark" Daymond John, and Power 105.1, to
sign one million new members  to  help  address  three  life-threatening
issues  facing communities every day, which include Gun & Gang Violence;
Heroin & Opioid Crisis; and Sexual Abuse Against Women; and
 
  WHEREAS, The campaign is held in May to prepare young citizens for a
long, hot violent summer as gun homicides and shootings continue to take
innocent young lives daily. Memorial Day weekend through  Labor  Day  is
the unofficial start and end of summer-a period when gun homicides spike
nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  a  decade  of working in some of the most dangerous
neighborhoods in the nation,  HHSYC  decided  to  go  from  a  week-long
campaign  to  a  month-long campaign each year to bring awareness to the
cause; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Hip-Hop
Against Gun & Gang Violence Month in the State of New York Month; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and to the Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council.
