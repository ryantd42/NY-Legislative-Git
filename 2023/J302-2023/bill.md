  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Deep Vein Thrombosis Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
months of awareness of important health issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as  Deep  Vein  Thrombosis
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Deep Vein Thrombosis Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, A national  public  health  crisis,  deep  vein  thrombosis
affects  about  two million Americans annually, and up to 600,000 people
in the United States are hospitalized each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Commonly referred to as DVT, deep  vein  thrombosis  occurs
when a blood clot develops in a deep vein, usually in the lower limbs; a
complication,  pulmonary  embolism, may occur when a fragment of a blood
clot breaks loose from the wall of the vein, migrates to the  lungs  and
blocks a pulmonary artery or one of its branches; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  may  include  pain,
swelling, tenderness, discoloration or redness of the affected area, and
skin that is warm to the touch; however, as many as half of all episodes
produce minimal symptoms or are completely "silent"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because a number  of  other  conditions,  including  muscle
strains,  skin  infections,  and  phlebitis  display symptoms similar to
those of deep  vein  thrombosis,  the  condition  may  be  difficult  to
diagnose without specific tests; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Deep  vein thrombosis is generally caused by a combination
of two or three underlying  conditions:  slow  or  sluggish  blood  flow
through  a  deep  vein,  a tendency for a person's blood to clot quickly
and/or irritation or inflammation of the inner lining of the vein; and
 
  WHEREAS, There  are  a  variety  of  settings  in  which  deep  vein
thrombosis  can occur; individuals on bed rest or confined and unable to
walk are highly susceptible, as well as those who have a family  history
or  specific  medical  conditions,  including  congestive heart failure,
severe obesity, chronic  respiratory  failure,  a  history  of  smoking,
varicose veins, pregnancy and estrogen treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to a U.S. multi-center study, only one-third of
hospitalized  patients  with  risk  factors  for  blood  clots  received
preventive  treatment; without preventive treatment, up to 60 percent of
patients who undergo total hip replacement surgery may develop deep vein
thrombosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cancer patients  undergoing  surgical  procedures  have  at
least twice the risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis and more than
 
three  times the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism as non-cancer patients
undergoing similar procedures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the elderly, deep vein thrombosis is associated with a
21 percent one-year mortality rate, and pulmonary embolism is associated
with a 39 percent one-year mortality rate; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, pulmonary embolism is  the  leading  cause  of
maternal  death associated with childbirth; a woman's risk of developing
a vein thrombosis embolism is six times greater when  she  is  pregnant;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Of those who develop pulmonary embolism, up to 300,000 will
die  each  year;  possibly the most common preventable cause of hospital
death in the United States, more people die from  it  than  from  breast
cancer and AIDS combined; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  in the interest of New York State to recognize the
achievements made  and  to  continue  these  efforts  by  promoting  the
awareness  and fostering the understanding of deep vein thrombosis; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as Deep Vein
Thrombosis Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
