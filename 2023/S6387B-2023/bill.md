  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation would provide a rebuttable statuto-
 ry presumption to Fire Alarm Dispatchers, whose disability results  from
 post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) and provide a performance of duty
 disability retirement benefit equivalent to 75% of  the  member's  Final
 Average  Salary  (FAS) offset by an explicit Workers' Compensation bene-
 fit.

  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who will benefit in the future from
 this fiscal note is unknown. The estimates presented herein are based on
 preliminary  census  data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data
 for the potentially impacted population  used  to  develop  the  average
 costs is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  187
  - Average Age:  41.0
  - Average Service:  12.2
  - Average Salary:  82,900
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, an active member of NYCERS who
 is employed as a Fire Alarm Dispatcher and becomes disabled due to PTSD,
 is eligible for an ordinary disability retirement, generally a  lifetime
 payment  of  1/60th of Final Average Salary (FAS) times service not less
 than 1/3 of FAS.
  Under the proposed legislation, the  performance  of  duty  disability
 benefit would be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  *  FAS  is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for Tier 6,
 with
  * an explicit Workers' Compensation offset.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of NYCERS.
  The number of additional members and eligible retirees who will  bene-
 fit  in  the future from this fiscal note is unknown and included as per
 incident disability costs. The cost of this proposed  legislation  could
 vary  greatly  depending on the number of future members who benefit and
 on their length of service, age, and salary history.
  The estimated per incident financial impact for disabled  members  has
 been  calculated  assuming  50%  would retire under the current ordinary
 disability benefit, and 50%  would  continue  working  if  the  proposed
 legislation were not passed.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
 S. 6387--B  4
 
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: Marek Tyszkiewicz and Gregory Zelikov-
 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and
 procedures  and  with  the Actuarial Standards of Practice issued by the
 Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-48 dated May 3, 2024
 was prepared by the Chief Actuary  for  the  New  York  City  Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would grant improved disability eligibility to any Tier 3,
 4, 5 or 6 member of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System (NYSLERS) employed in the title of
  1. Communication technician, specialist, or operator,
  2. Radio dispatcher or Emergency dispatcher, or
  3. County 911 dispatcher or supervisor.
  For any member so employed who is diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
 disorder, resulting in disability, such diagnosis shall be considered as
 presumptive evidence that the disability was incurred in the performance
 of  the  member's  duties,  unless  the  contrary be proven by competent
 evidence. The annual accidental disability  benefit  for  these  members
 would be 75% of final average salary (FAS), minus workers' compensation.
 Current disability benefits vary by employer.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.4 billion.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $445 million as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of the
 State of New York and local participating  employers  will  increase  by
 2.0%  of  affected  member  salary,  or approximately $42 million to the
 State of New York and 49.5 million to the local participating employers,
 beginning in fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.  This  PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
  Further, this proposal will require many of  the  3,000  participating
 employers  to  modify  their  reporting  to  the NYSLERS to identify the
 affected members. As a result, we anticipate  additional  administrative
 costs to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
