 Introduced  by  Sen.  MYRIE  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to prohibiting the
  manufacture, distribution and sale of toys  and  child  care  products
  containing phthalates

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The  legislature  hereby  finds  that
 phthalates  are  a  class  of chemicals used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
 plastic to improve flexibility and in cosmetics to bind fragrance to the
 product. Phthalates are used in  many products intended for use by young
 children including, but not limited to, teethers, toys and soft  plastic
 books.
  It  is  further  found  that  there is extensive scientific literature
 reporting the hormone disrupting effect of phthalates,  and  substantial
 evidence that levels of the phthalates of concern are found in humans at
 levels  associated  with  adverse  effects. Population studies show that
 virtually everyone carries some level of phthalates in their  body.  For
 the general population, the oral route of exposure is considered a major
 route.
  § 2. The general business law is amended by adding a new section 397-b
 to read as follows:
  § 397-B. TOYS AND CHILD CARE PRODUCTS; PHTHALATES. 1. FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION:
  (A)  "CHILD  CARE  ARTICLE" MEANS ALL PRODUCTS DESIGNED OR INTENDED BY
 THE MANUFACTURER TO FACILITATE SLEEP, RELAXATION OR THE FEEDING OF CHIL-
 DREN, OR TO HELP CHILDREN WITH SUCKING OR TEETHING;
  (B) "TOY" MEANS ALL PRODUCTS DESIGNED OR INTENDED BY THE  MANUFACTURER
 TO BE USED BY CHILDREN WHEN THEY PLAY.
  2. NO PERSON, FIRM, PARTNERSHIP, ASSOCIATION, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPA-
 NY  OR CORPORATION SHALL MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, SELL OR OFFER FOR SALE
