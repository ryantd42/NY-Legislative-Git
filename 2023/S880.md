 Introduced  by  Sen.  LIU  --  read  twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to culturally  responsive
  teaching
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative finding. The  legislature  finds  and  declares
 that:
  1. Culture is essential to learning;
  2. Culture plays a role not only in communicating and receiving infor-
 mation,  but also in shaping the thinking process of groups and individ-
 uals;
  3. A pedagogy that acknowledges, responds to, and celebrates fundamen-
 tal cultures offers full, equitable access to education for pupils  from
 all cultures;
  4.  Culturally  responsive teaching is a major civilizing influence on
 the development of a humane, responsible and informed citizenry, able to
 adjust to and grow in a rapidly changing  world.  Culturally  responsive
 teaching  can substantiate a claim to the prevention of human and social
 costs to the state. Culturally responsive teaching develops  the  social
 consciousness  of  students  to better handle the world of prejudice and
 racism.  Culturally responsive teaching provides students with the back-
 ground in social studies and  humanities  so  that  they  will  function
 successfully and tolerantly in a participatory democracy and a multicul-
 tural  nation  and  world.  Culturally responsive teaching incorporates
 multicultural information, books, and other educational resources; and
  5. It is recognized that students in public elementary  and  secondary
 schools  can  only  reach  the  levels of performance expected under the
 provisions of this part with parental  participation  in  the  education
 process. It is therefore, the policy of this state to provide culturally
 responsive  services  for  young children and their families. Culturally

 responsive services for young children and their families should reflect
 the importance of integration and diversity to the maximum extent possi-
 ble in regard to characteristics such as race,  economics,  sex,  creed,
 capability  and  cultural  differences.  Services  should be designed to
 support and strengthen the family and be  planned  in  consideration  of
 existing  family  values,  with the primary concern being the welfare of
 the child.
  § 2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 3039 to read
 as follows:
  § 3039. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE  INSTRUCTION

 ITY  PLAN  SHALL  INCLUDE  THE  AMOUNT OF CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHING
