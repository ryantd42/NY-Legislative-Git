  § 3. Subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 295  of  the  executive  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  8  of  the  laws  of  2019, are amended to read as
 follows:
  8. To create such advisory councils, local, regional or state-wide, as
 in  its  judgment  will aid in effectuating the purposes of this article
 and of section eleven of article one of the constitution of this  state,
 and  the  division  may  empower them to study the problems of discrimi-

 origin,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or expression, military

 also  shall  disseminate  information about the division's activities to
 organizations and individuals in their localities. Such  advisory  coun-
 cils  shall be composed of representative citizens, serving without pay,
 but with reimbursement for actual and necessary traveling expenses;  and
 the division may make provision for technical and clerical assistance to
 such councils and for the expenses of such assistance.
  9. To develop human rights plans and policies for the state and assist
 in their execution and to make investigations and studies appropriate to
 effectuate  this article and to issue such publications and such results

 to promote good-will and minimize or eliminate discrimination because of
 age, race, creed, color, national  origin,  sexual  orientation,  gender
 identity  or  expression, military status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disa-
 bility or marital status.
  § 4. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (h) of subdivision 1 of section
 296 of the executive law, as separately amended by chapters 202 and  748
 of the laws of 2022, are amended to read as follows:
  (a)  For  an  employer or licensing agency, because of an individual's
 age, race, creed, color, national  origin,  citizenship  or  immigration
 status,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or expression, military
 status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disability, predisposing genetic charac-
 teristics, familial status, marital status, or status  as  a  victim  of
 domestic violence, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge
 from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individ-
 ual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.
  (b)  For  an  employment agency to discriminate against any individual
 because of age, race, creed,  color,  national  origin,  citizenship  or
 immigration  status,  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
 military status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disability, predisposing genet-
 ic characteristics, familial status, marital  status,  or  status  as  a
 victim  of  domestic  violence,  in receiving, classifying, disposing or
 otherwise acting upon applications for its services or in  referring  an
 applicant or applicants to an employer or employers.
  (c)  For a labor organization, because of the age, race, creed, color,
 national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual  orientation,
 gender  identity or expression, military status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME,
 disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, mari-
 tal status, or status as a victim of domestic violence, of any  individ-
 ual,  to  exclude  or to expel from its membership such individual or to
 discriminate in any way against  any  of  its  members  or  against  any
 employer or any individual employed by an employer.
 S. 4172  3
 
  (d)  For  any  employer  or employment agency to print or circulate or
 cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publi-
 cation, or to use any form of application for employment or to make  any
 inquiry  in  connection  with  prospective  employment,  which expresses
 directly  or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination
 as to age, race, creed, color, national  origin,  citizenship  or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary  status,  sex,  PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disability, predisposing genetic
 characteristics, familial status, marital status, or status as a  victim
 of  domestic  violence, or any intent to make any such limitation, spec-
 ification or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide  occupational
 qualification;  provided,  however,  that neither this paragraph nor any
 provision of this chapter or other law shall be  construed  to  prohibit
 the  department  of  civil service or the department of personnel of any
 city containing more than one county from  requesting  information  from
 applicants  for  civil service examinations concerning any of the afore-
 mentioned  characteristics,  other  than  sexual  orientation,  for  the
 purpose  of conducting studies to identify and resolve possible problems
 in recruitment and testing of members of minority groups to  ensure  the
 fairest  possible  and  equal  opportunities for employment in the civil
 service for all persons, regardless of age, race, creed, color, national
 origin, citizenship or immigration status, sexual orientation or  gender
 identity  or  expression, military status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disa-
 bility, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, or  mari-
 tal status.
  (h)  For  an  employer,  licensing  agency, employment agency or labor
 organization to subject any individual to harassment because of an indi-
 vidual's age, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary  status,  sex,  PREGNANCY OUTCOME, disability, predisposing genetic
 characteristics, familial status, marital status, status as a victim  of
 domestic  violence,  or because the individual has opposed any practices
 forbidden under this article or  because  the  individual  has  filed  a
 complaint,  testified  or assisted in any proceeding under this article,
 regardless of whether such harassment  would  be  considered  severe  or
 pervasive  under precedent applied to harassment claims. Such harassment
 is an unlawful discriminatory practice when it subjects an individual to
 inferior terms, conditions or privileges of employment  because  of  the
 individual's  membership  in  one or more of these protected categories.
 The fact that such individual did not make a complaint about the harass-
 ment to such employer, licensing  agency,  employment  agency  or  labor
 organization  shall  not  be  determinative  of  whether  such employer,
 licensing agency, employment  agency  or  labor  organization  shall  be
 liable. Nothing in this section shall imply that an employee must demon-
 strate  the  existence of an individual to whom the employee's treatment
 must be compared. It shall be an affirmative defense to liability  under
 this  subdivision  that  the  harassing  conduct does not rise above the
 level of what a  reasonable  victim  of  discrimination  with  the  same
 protected characteristic or characteristics would consider petty slights
 or trivial inconveniences.
  §  5. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision 1-a of section 296 of
 the executive law, as separately amended by chapters 202 and 748 of  the
 laws of 2022, are amended to read as follows:
  (b)  To  deny  to  or withhold from any person because of race, creed,

 or expression, military status, sex, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, age, disability,

 advantages, facilities  and  privileges  of  any  such  place  shall  be
 refused,  withheld  from  or  denied  to  any person on account of race,
