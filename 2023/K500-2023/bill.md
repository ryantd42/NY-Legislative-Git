  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 20, 2023, as Armed Forces Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,
who have served so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars  in  which  this
country's  freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of peace
in peacetime, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to commend  those
who  have  served in times of active conflict, as well as those who have
served in times of peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  Saturday,  May 20, 2023, as Armed
Forces Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance
of National Armed Forces Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Americans celebrate Armed Forces Day annually on the third
Saturday of May, and Armed Forces Week, which begins every year  on  the
second Saturday of May; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  events  across the United States take place on Armed
Forces Day to honor Americans in uniform who  served  their  country  in
times of war and peace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  President  Harry  S.  Truman led the effort to establish a
single holiday for citizens to come  together  and  thank  our  military
members for their patriotic service in support of our country; on August
31, 1949, Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, announced the creation of
an Armed Forces Day to replace separate Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air
Force Days; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Previously  observed as Armistice Day, which honored those
who wore the cloth of our nation at war; and unlike Memorial Day,  which
honors  those  who  died  wearing  the cloth of our nation at war, Armed
Forces Day is the proper day to honor all of the men and women currently
serving, as well as those who have served and sacrificed to  defend  our
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Guard and Reserve units may celebrate Armed Forces
Day/Week  over  any  period  in  May  because  of  their unique training
schedules; and
 
  WHEREAS, Events and activities may  include  multi-service  military
displays  in  areas  open for the public; various educational activities
that teach children about the Armed Forces; and
 
  WHEREAS, Certain types of music  are  played  at  Armed  Forces  Day
events,  including  at  memorials and at cemeteries, as a way to respect
those in the Armed Forces who died for their country, such as "Taps"  on
the bugle; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which these men and women served their country, and must recognize
that no greater debt is owed than that owed  to  those  who  gave  their
lives  for  their beloved Nation and to those who continue to be missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and abroad,
these men and women demonstrated their love for their country and  merit
forevermore, the highest respect of their State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  Nation's veterans deserve to be recognized, commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 20, 2023, as Armed
Forces Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
