 AN  ACT  to amend the tax law, in relation to the disposition of certain
  revenue with respect to debt incurred in the redevelopment project  at
  Belmont  Park  racetrack; and to authorize the New York Racing Associ-
  ation, Inc. to enter into a repayment agreement with the state of  New
  York  for  payment  of bonds issued by the state for the renovation of
  Belmont Park
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that it is in
 the interests of the state to assist the franchised corporation pursuant
 to section 206 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law,  in
 obtaining  the  financing  the  franchised corporation needs to renovate
 Belmont Park.  The legislature further finds  that  the  cost  of  this
 project is anticipated to be four hundred fifty-five million dollars and
 that  the  state  has  the ability to issue personal income tax or state
 sales tax bonds to generate such funds. The  legislature  further  finds
 that  authorizing  access  to  this financing will enable the franchised
 corporation to make a major investment in Nassau County that  will  lead
 to new job opportunities and bolster the local economy.
  §  2. Issuance of certain bonds or notes. 1. Subject to the provisions
 of chapter 59 of the laws of 2000, and consistent  with  any  agreements
 and  leases  between  the  franchised corporation designated pursuant to
 section 206 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law and the
 people of the state of New York acting by and through  the  state  fran-
 chise  oversight  board, but notwithstanding the provisions of any other
 law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the  dormitory  authority  and
 the  urban  development  corporation  are  hereby  authorized  to  issue
 personal income tax or state sales tax bonds in one or more  series  for

 the  purpose  of  funding  project costs for the Belmont Racetrack reno-
 vation project and other state costs associated with such  project.  The
 aggregate  principal amount of bonds authorized to be issued pursuant to
 this  section  shall  not  exceed  four  hundred  fifty million dollars,
 excluding bonds issued to fund one or more debt service  reserve  funds,
 to  pay  costs  of  issuance of such bonds, and bonds or notes issued to
 refund or otherwise repay such bonds or notes previously issued.  Eligi-
 ble project costs may include, but not be limited to the cost of design,
 financing,  site investigations, site acquisition and preparation, demo-
 lition,  construction,  rehabilitation,  acquisition  of  machinery  and
 equipment,  and infrastructure improvements. Such bonds and notes of the
 dormitory authority and the urban development corporation shall not be a
 debt of the state, and the state shall not be liable thereon, nor  shall
 they  be  payable  out of any funds other than those appropriated by the
 state to the dormitory authority and the urban  development  corporation
 for  principal,  interest,  and  related  expenses pursuant to a service
 contract and such bonds and notes shall contain on the  face  thereof  a
 statement  to  such  effect.  Except  for purposes of complying with the
 internal revenue code, any interest income earned on bond proceeds shall
 only be used to pay debt service on such bonds.
  2. Notwithstanding any other provision of  law  to  the  contrary,  in
 order to assist the dormitory authority and the urban development corpo-
 ration  in undertaking the financing for project costs for Belmont Race-
 track renovation project and other  state  costs  associated  with  such
 project,  the  director of the budget is hereby authorized to enter into
 one or more service contracts with the dormitory authority and the urban
 development corporation, none of which  shall  exceed  thirty  years  in
 duration,  upon  such terms and conditions as the director of the budget
 and the dormitory authority and the urban development corporation agree,
 so as to annually provide to  the  dormitory  authority  and  the  urban
 development corporation, in the aggregate, a sum not to exceed the prin-
 cipal, interest, and related expenses required for such bonds and notes.
 Any service contract entered into pursuant to this section shall provide
 that  the  obligation  of  the  state to pay the amount therein provided
 shall not constitute a debt of the  state  within  the  meaning  of  any
 constitutional or statutory provision and shall be deemed executory only
 to  the  extent  of  monies  available  and  that  no liability shall be
 incurred by the state beyond the  monies  available  for  such  purpose,
 subject  to  annual appropriation by the legislature.  Any such contract
 or any payments made or to  be  made  thereunder  may  be  assigned  and
 pledged by the dormitory authority and the urban development corporation
 as security for its bonds and notes, as authorized by this section.
  §  3.  Prior  to,  and  as  a condition to the state issuing the bonds
 described in section two of this act, the franchised  corporation  shall
 enter  into an agreement with the state allowing the funds dedicated for
 capital expenditures of the franchised corporation pursuant to paragraph
 3 of subdivision f and paragraph 3 of subdivision f-1 of section 1612 of
 the tax law shall be directed to the state for  repayment  of  the  debt
 service  on  such bonds.  The franchised corporation shall further agree
 that should the  corporation  receive  statutory  payments  pursuant  to
 subdivision  three  of  section 1355 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering
 and breeding law, enacted for the specific purpose of holding the  fran-
 chised  corporation  harmless for any loss of payments pursuant to para-
 graph 3 of subdivision f and paragraph 3 of subdivision f-1  of  section
 1612  of the tax law, these payments shall also be directed to the state
 for repayment of the debt service on such bonds.
 A. 165  3
 
  § 4. Contemporaneously with the state entering  into  agreements  with
 regards  to  issuing the bonds described in section one of this act, the
 state and the franchised corporation are authorized  to  enter  into  an
 agreement  to determine how the franchised corporation should relinquish
 its  leasehold  interest  in  real property located in South Ozone Park,
 commonly known as Aqueduct Racetrack, back to the state upon substantial
 completion of the renovation of Belmont Park.
  § 5. The New York State Gaming Commission shall  ensure  that  to  the
 extent  that  the law allows for a franchise agreement with a franchisee
 other than the franchised corporation, the term of  any  such  franchise
 agreement  awarded  after the issuance of any bonds described by section
 two of this act includes a provision by such franchisee that such  fran-
 chisee  will continue to pay the funds required by section three of this
 act.

 1612  of  the  tax law is designated subparagraph (i) and a new subpara-
 graph (ii) is added to read as follows:
