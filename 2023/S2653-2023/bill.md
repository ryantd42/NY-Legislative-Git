  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general business law is amended by adding a new section
 390-e to read as follows:
  § 390-E. CELL PHONE USERS' BILL OF RIGHTS. 1. ANY PERSON, FIRM, CORPO-
 RATION, OR OTHER ENTITY THAT OFFERS CELLULAR PHONES AND  CELLULAR  PHONE
 SERVICES  TO  THE  PUBLIC  SHALL PROVIDE EACH CUSTOMER WITH A THIRTY-DAY
 TRIAL PERIOD. IF A CUSTOMER RETURNS A PHONE OR  CANCELS  SERVICE  WITHIN
 THAT  THIRTY-DAY  PERIOD,  HE  OR SHE SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY TERMI-
 NATION FEES.
  A. WHEN A NEW PHONE IS PURCHASED, THE THIRTY-DAY PERIOD SHALL COMMENCE
 WHEN THE CUSTOMER PHYSICALLY RECEIVES THE PHONE.
  B. WHEN A PERSON APPLIES FOR NEW SERVICE, THE THIRTY-DAY PERIOD  SHALL
 COMMENCE WHEN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IS ACTIVATED.
  2.  WHENEVER  A PERSON RETURNS A PHONE OR CANCELS A SERVICE WITHIN THE
 THIRTY-DAY TRIAL PERIOD REQUIRED PURSUANT TO  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  SUCH  PERSON  SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MONTHLY ACCESS FEE,
 PRO RATA, AND SHALL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS OF ANY CALLS  MADE
 BY SUCH PERSON IF THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THE MONTHLY ACCESS FEE.
  3.  A.  ANY  PERSON,  FIRM, CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY THAT PROVIDES
 CELLULAR PHONE SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER FOR A FEE,  SUCH  FEE  SHALL  ONLY
 INCLUDE  THOSE  SERVICES  AUTHORIZED  BY  THE CUSTOMER. NO PERSON, FIRM,
 CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY SHALL CHARGE A  CUSTOMER  FOR  ANY  SERVICE
 SUCH CUSTOMER DID NOT REQUEST OR AUTHORIZE.
  B. ANY PERSON, FIRM, CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY THAT PROVIDES CELLU-
 LAR  PHONE SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER FOR A FEE SHALL INCLUDE ON ITS MONTHLY

 SUCH  BREAKDOWN  SHALL  FURTHER SPECIFY WHICH FEES, TAXES, OR SURCHARGES

 IMPOSED BY THE COMPANY. SUCH MONTHLY STATEMENT SHALL  ALSO  INCLUDE  THE
 RATES AND TERMS OF THE CUSTOMER'S SERVICE AGREEMENT.
  4.  A  CUSTOMER  SHALL  NOT  BE  LIABLE  FOR ANY CHARGES TO HIS OR HER
 ACCOUNT IF SUCH CHARGES ARE THE RESULT OF CALLS OR MESSAGES PLACED  FROM

 BILITY OF THE PERSON, FIRM, CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY TO ENSURE  THAT
 ALL  SERVICES  ARE  USED  SOLELY  BY  THE PHONE REGISTERED TO THE PERSON
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THE SERVICE AGREEMENT. A CUSTOMER SHALL NOT  BE  LIABLE
 FOR  ANY  CHARGES  RESULTING  FROM  THE THEFT OF THE CUSTOMER'S CELLULAR
 PHONE IDENTIFICATION OR SIGNAL.
  5. ANY PERSON, FIRM, CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY  THAT  VIOLATES  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  PAY  A  FINE OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE
