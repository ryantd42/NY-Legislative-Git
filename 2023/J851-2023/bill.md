  CONGRATULATING  Shannen  Fung upon the occasion of

  prestigious of Scouting honors
 
  WHEREAS,  Shannen  Fung, through her diligence and rigorous efforts,
has achieved Scouting's highest and most  prestigious  honor,  the  Gold
Award; the ceremony will be held on Tuesday, June 6, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shannen  Fung  is  a  member  of Girl Scouts of the United
States of America in Nassau County, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, America has achieved her greatest heights of glory  through
the  dedication,  determination, and tireless efforts of the outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is only with the continued diligence and devotion of our
youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain her glory; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Girl Scouts of America and its members are dedicated to
the development of character and leadership in the youth of this Nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1916, Senior Girl Scouts have  sought  to  cap  their
years  in  Girl  Scouting  with  the prized Gold Award, which challenges
girls to change the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, In order to earn the Gold Award, a  girl  must  complete  a
rigorous  set  of  service,  leadership  development, and skill-building
tasks leading up to the final  and  most  challenging  requirement,  the
design  and completion of a Take Action Project; this project must be an
issue of interest to the  girl  and  her  community,  employ  team-based
solutions, and educate and inspire others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  her project entitled "Small Bites of Legacy: Bridging
the Generational Gap Through Food," Shannen Fung addressed the issue  of
senior  loneliness  and  bridged  the  generational  gap by interviewing
residents from a senior housing community about their favorite  recipes;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This outstanding young woman has been involved in Scouting
for years, has lived up to Scouting's ideals and has  attained  all  the
necessary achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shannen  Fung  is  a credit to her family, her school, her
community, her State and her Nation, and no doubt  her  future  will  be
filled with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations, in
recognition of the significance  of  this  meritorious  achievement,  to
congratulate  and  honor  Shannen  Fung upon the occasion of earning the
Gold Award; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Shannen Fung.
