  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Agricul-
  ture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to pollina-
  tor protection
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature  finds  that the
 protection of pollinators, including both wild pollinators  and  managed
 bees,  is  of critical importance to the environment and to all agricul-
 tural industries in the state. To address the losses of managed pollina-
 tor colonies observed by beekeepers in the early part of  this  century,
 the department of agriculture and markets and the department of environ-
 mental  conservation  adopted  the  New York state pollinator protection
 plan in June, 2016, with the goal of developing  a  plan  for  New  York
 state  to  protect, conserve and increase pollinators in the state.  The
 New York state pollinator protection  plan  identifies  best  management
 practices,  habitat  enhancement  projects,  research,  and outreach and
 education as critical to reversing declining pollinator populations. The
 plan increases awareness of the health issues challenging the pollinator
 community among all parties that interface  with  pollinators.  The  New
 York  state pollinator protection plan recognizes that the single great-
 est threat to pollinators are the diseases that  currently  exist  among
 the  bee population, and control of those diseases is the best remedy to
 address a decline in pollinator populations. However, the New York state
 pollinator protection plan also outlines better ways of  doing  business
 for  those  entities  engaged  in  activities that can affect pollinator
 viability, as well as ways to enhance and create habitats to support and
 increase New York's pollinator population. The New York state pollinator
 protection plan achieves that goal through the development and recommen-
 dation of best management practices for all sectors of the  agricultural

 industry  that  manage  and use pollinators, and all other parties whose
 activities may impact pollinators. This legislation will  provide  addi-
 tional  guidance  to  all  parties who may impact pollinators on actions
 that  must  be taken to preserve and protect New York's pollinator popu-
 lation.
