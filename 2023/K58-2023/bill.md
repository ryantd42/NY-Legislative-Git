  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 27, 2023, as Holocaust  Remembrance  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious events
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  tradition,  it  is  the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  27,  2023,  as
Holocaust  Remembrance Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of International Holocaust Remembrance Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, From 1933 to 1945, six million Jews were  murdered  in  the
Nazi Holocaust as part of a systematic program of genocide, and millions
of other people also perished as victims of Nazism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jews  who fell under German control in Eastern and Central
Europe were quickly stripped of their rights and property; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jews who perished at Nazi hands comprised two-thirds of
all European Jewry, and in countries such as Poland,  which  before  the
second  World  War included parts of the Ukraine and Belarus, the Jewish
death toll surpassed 90 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2023 marks the 90th Anniversary of  the  beginning
of the genocide of European Jews, the bleakest, most murderous moment in
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Holocaust  represents  the  darkest  period  in  the
civilization of mankind and  must  always  be  remembered  in  order  to
prevent its reoccurrence anywhere else in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is observed
on January 27th each year, is  a  day  set  aside  for  remembering  the
millions  of  victims  of the Holocaust; this date was designated by the
United Nations General Assembly on November 1, 2005,  as  it  marks  the
date when Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp, was liberated
by Soviet Troops in 1945; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year marks the 78th Anniversary of the liberation of
Auschwitz-Birkenau;  remembrance  ceremonies  are  held  throughout  the
United  States  and  around  the  world  to  remember the tragedy of the
Holocaust on January 27th, including at Holocaust Museum in  Washington,
D.C., and in the halls of the United Nations in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  critically important to remember the events of the
Holocaust to ensure that the events shall "never again" happen,  as  has
been the rallying cry among the Jewish people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In times of war and chaos, with the threat of genocide and
ethnic cleansing present in many war-torn  regions  of  the  world,  the
 
events  of  the  Holocaust  continue  to  be  relevant  and important to
remember so that suffering on this scale truly never does happen  again;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Knowing  the  events and root causes of the Holocaust must
not be forgotten and that, particularly as survivors diminish in number,
links must be forged to educate future generations; now,  therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  27,  2023,  as
Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
