 AN ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to requiring legislative
  approval for the closure of correctional facilities and institutions
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The correction law is amended by adding a new section 30 to
 read as follows:
  §  30. CLOSURE OF CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL SUBMIT
 A WRITTEN REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AT LEAST  THREE  HUNDRED  SIXTY-FIVE
 DAYS  PRIOR TO THE DATE THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING CLOSURE OF ANY CORREC-
 TIONAL FACILITY OR INSTITUTION. SUCH REPORT SHALL INCLUDE  JUSTIFICATION
 FOR  THE  PROPOSED  CLOSURE.  THE LEGISLATURE MAY REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION OR DATA THAT IT DEEMS NECESSARY IN  SUCH  REPORT.  IF  THE
 LEGISLATURE,  OR  THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES THEREOF, UPON REVIEW OF THE
 REPORT SUBMITTED TO IT  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,  FINDS  THAT  THE  PROPOSED
 CLOSURE  IS NOT JUSTIFIED THEN CLOSURE SHALL NOT OCCUR UNTIL APPROVED BY
 A MAJORITY VOTE OF EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE.
  § 2. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction  to
 be  invalid,  such  judgment  shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
 remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,
 sentence, paragraph, section or part thereof directly  involved  in  the
 controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
