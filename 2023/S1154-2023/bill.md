 ities and such production. Under no circumstances shall this subdivision
 be  construed  to  include  operations whose primary on site function is

 an  agricultural  enterprise  that is proposed or in its first or second
 year of operation may qualify as a commercial  equine  operation  if  it

 FIVE thousand dollars or more, the owner may nevertheless qualify for an
 agricultural assessment provided the owner shall  substantiate  in  such
 manner  as  prescribed  by the commissioner of taxation and finance that
 the agricultural production initiated on such land would  have  produced
 an  average gross sales value of [ten] FIVE thousand dollars or more but
 for the natural disaster, act of God or continued adverse weather condi-
 tions.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
