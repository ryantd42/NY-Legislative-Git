 sion 4 as amended by chapter 169 of the laws of 2013, and subdivision  5

 follows:
  1. Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply  through-
 out the state to each person required or otherwise ordered by a court as
 a condition of SENTENCE, PLEA, probation or conditional discharge, WHICH
 SHALL  PROHIBIT  THE  OPERATION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING
 IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE AND REQUIRES SUCH PERSON to install and [oper-
 ate] MAINTAIN an ignition interlock device in any vehicle [which  he  or
 she owns or operates] OPERATED BY SUCH PERSON.
  2.  Requirements. (a) In addition to any other penalties prescribed by
 law, the court shall require that any person who has been convicted [of]
 OR ADJUDICATED A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER FOR a violation of  subdivision  two,
 S. 775  7
 
 two-a [or], three OR FOUR-A of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this
 article,  or any crime defined by this chapter or the penal law of which
 an alcohol-related violation of any provision of section eleven  hundred
 ninety-two of this article is an essential element, [to] SHALL NOT OPER-
 ATE  A MOTOR VEHICLE WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE AND
 SHALL install and maintain, as a condition of PLEA, SENTENCE,  probation
 or  conditional  discharge,  a  functioning ignition interlock device in
 accordance with the provisions of this section and,  as  applicable,  in
 accordance  with the provisions of subdivisions one and one-a of section
 eleven hundred ninety-three of  this  article;  provided,  however,  the
 court  may  not authorize the operation of a motor vehicle by any person
 whose license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle has  been  revoked
 except as provided herein. For any such individual subject to a sentence
 of  probation,  installation  and maintenance of such ignition interlock
 device shall be a condition of probation.
  (b) Nothing contained in this section shall  prohibit  a  court,  upon
 application  by a probation department, from modifying the conditions of
 probation of any person convicted of any violation set  forth  in  para-
 graph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  prior  to  the effective date of this
 section, to require the installation and maintenance  of  a  functioning
 ignition  interlock  device, and such person shall thereafter be subject
 to the provisions of this section.
  [(c) Nothing contained in this section  shall  authorize  a  court  to
 sentence  any  person  to a period of probation or conditional discharge
 for the purpose of subjecting such person  to  the  provisions  of  this
 section,  unless such person would have otherwise been so eligible for a
 sentence of probation or conditional discharge.]
  3. Conditions. (a) [Notwithstanding any other provision of law] EXCEPT
 AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR SENTENCES IMPOSED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (G) OF
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-THREE OF THIS  CHAPTER,
 the commissioner may grant a post-revocation conditional license, as set
 forth  in  paragraph  (b)  of this subdivision, to a person who has been
 convicted of a violation of subdivision two, two-a [or], three OR FOUR-A
 of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article and  who  has  been
 sentenced  to  a  period of probation or conditional discharge, provided
 the person has satisfied the minimum period of license revocation estab-
 lished by law and the commissioner has been notified  that  such  person
 may  operate  only  a motor vehicle equipped with a functioning ignition
 interlock device.  No such request shall  be  made  nor  shall  such  a
 license be granted, however, if such person has been found by a court to
 have  committed a violation of section five hundred eleven of this chap-
 ter during the license revocation period or deemed by a  court  to  have
 violated  any  condition of probation or conditional discharge set forth
 by the court relating to  the  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  or  the
 consumption  of  alcohol. In exercising discretion relating to the issu-
 ance of a post-revocation conditional license pursuant to this  subdivi-
 sion,  the  commissioner  shall not deny such issuance based solely upon
 the number of convictions for violations of any subdivision  of  section
 eleven hundred ninety-two of this article committed by such person with-
 in  the ten years prior to application for such license. Upon the termi-
 nation of the period of probation or conditional discharge  set  by  the
 court,  the  person  may  apply to the commissioner for restoration of a
 license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in accordance with  this
 chapter.
  (b)  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision  of this chapter, a
 post-revocation conditional license granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of
 S. 775  8
 
 this subdivision shall be valid only for use by the holder thereof,  (1)
 [enroute]  EN ROUTE to and from the holder's place of employment, (2) if
 the holder's employment requires the operation of a motor  vehicle  then
 during  the hours thereof, (3) [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a class or
 course at an accredited school, college or  university  or  at  a  state
 approved  institution  of  vocational  or technical training, (4) to and
 from court ordered probation activities, (5) to and from a motor vehicle
 office for the transaction of business relating to such license, (6) for
 a three hour consecutive daytime period, chosen by the department, on  a
 day  during  which the participant is not engaged in usual employment or
 vocation, (7) [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a  medical  examination  or
 treatment  as part of a necessary medical treatment for such participant
 or member of the participant's household,  as  evidenced  by  a  written
 statement  to  that  effect  from  a  licensed medical practitioner, (8)
 [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a  class  or  an  activity  which  is  an
 authorized  part  of  the alcohol and drug rehabilitation program and at
 which participant's attendance is required, and (9) [enroute]  EN  ROUTE
 to and from a place, including a school, at which a child or children of
 the  participant are cared for on a regular basis and which is necessary
 for the participant to maintain such participant's employment or enroll-
 ment at an accredited school,  college  or  university  or  at  a  state
 approved institution of vocational or technical training.
  (c) The post-revocation conditional license described in this subdivi-
 sion  may  be revoked by the commissioner for sufficient cause including
 but not limited to, failure to comply with the terms of the condition of
 probation or conditional discharge set forth by the court, conviction of
 any traffic offense other than one involving parking, stopping or stand-
 ing [or], conviction of any alcohol or drug related offense, misdemeanor
 or felony, ANY VIOLATION OF THIS ARTICLE WITH  RESPECT  TO  OPERATING  A
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  WITHOUT  A  FUNCTIONING  IGNITION  INTERLOCK DEVICE WHEN
 REQUIRED TO DO SO, or failure to install or  maintain  a  court  ordered
 ignition interlock device.
  (d)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the court from requiring,
 as a condition of probation or conditional discharge,  the  installation
 of a functioning ignition interlock device in any vehicle owned or oper-
 ated  by  a  person sentenced for a violation of subdivision two, two-a,
 [or] three OR FOUR-A of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this [chap-
 ter] ARTICLE, or any crime defined by this chapter or the penal  law  of
 which  an  alcohol-related  violation of any provision of section eleven
 hundred ninety-two of this [chapter] ARTICLE is an essential element, if
 the court in its discretion, determines that such a condition is  neces-
 sary  to  ensure  the public safety. Imposition of an ignition interlock
 condition shall in no way limit the effect  of  any  period  of  license

 finding  that  the  person  is  not the owner of a motor vehicle if such
 person asserts under oath that such person is not the owner of any motor
 vehicle and that he or she will not operate any motor vehicle during the
 period of interlock restriction except as may  be  otherwise  authorized
 pursuant  to  law.]  "Owner"  shall have the same meaning as provided in

 maintaining  the  ignition interlock device shall be borne by the person
 subject to such condition unless the court  determines  such  person  is
 financially  unable  to  afford  such  cost  whereupon  such cost may be
 imposed pursuant to a payment plan or waived.  In  the  event  of  such
 waiver,  the  cost of the device shall be borne in accordance with regu-
 lations issued under paragraph (g) of subdivision one of section  eleven
 hundred ninety-three of this article or pursuant to such other agreement
 S. 775  10

 instead be in addition to, any fines, surcharges, or other costs imposed
 pursuant to this chapter or other applicable laws.
