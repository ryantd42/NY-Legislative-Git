 loan,  or  upon the property, OR ANY PORTION OF SUCH PROPERTY, improved,

 all or part of any such loan may be unsecured if  necessary  to  satisfy
 the  requirements of any participating lender. Such loan shall be repaid
 over such period as the agency shall determine.
  g. For purposes of this section, (I) the term "mortgage" shall include
 any pledge or assignment of shares or assignment of a proprietary  lease
 in  a cooperative housing corporation where such pledge or assignment is
 intended as security for the performance  of  an  obligation  and  which
 imposes  a  lien  on or affects title to such shares or such proprietary
 lease; AND (II) THE TERM "OWNER" SHALL MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL,  PARTNERSHIP,
 CORPORATION  OR  OTHER  ENTITY, INCLUDING A NON-PROFIT COMPANY, A MUTUAL
 COMPANY, OR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUND COMPANY, HAVING RECORD OR BENEFI-
 CIAL TITLE IN FEE SIMPLE TO REAL PROPERTY OR THE LESSEE THEREOF UNDER  A
 LEASE HAVING A TERM OF AT LEAST FORTY-NINE YEARS.
  § 2. Section 696-a of the general municipal law, as amended by chapter
 465 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  § 696-a. Loans. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special
 or local law, an agency is hereby authorized to make or contract to make
 grants  or  loans[: (i)] to the owner of any property that is part of an
 urban development action area project for the purpose of: (I)  rehabili-
 tation  of  an  existing  private  or  multiple  dwelling, (ii) [for the
 purpose of] providing site improvements  WITHIN  THE  URBAN  DEVELOPMENT
 ACTION  AREA  IN  WHICH  THE  URBAN  DEVELOPMENT  ACTION AREA PROJECT IS
 LOCATED, including, but not limited  to,  water  and  sewer  facilities,
 sidewalks,  landscaping,  PARKS  AND  OPEN  SPACE, SOCIAL, RECREATIONAL,
 COMMUNAL AND OTHER NON-RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND THE OUTFITTING  THERE-
 OF,  the  curing  of  problems caused by abnormal site conditions, exca-
 vation and construction of footings and foundations and  other  improve-
 ments associated with the provision of infrastructure, or (iii) [for the
 purpose  of]  providing for other costs of construction for the develop-
 ment of private and multiple dwelling  housing  accommodations.  In  the
 case  of  a  grant  made under this section for the rehabilitation of an
 existing multiple dwelling intended to be converted to a condominium  or
 cooperative form of ownership or for the development of one to four unit
 housing  accommodations  or  a condominium or cooperative housing corpo-
 ration, such grant shall require a regulatory agreement with the  agency
 limiting profits. Any loan made in accordance with this section shall be
 secured by a note and mortgage upon the property, OR ANY PORTION OF SUCH
 PROPERTY, improved or, in the case of a condominium, a note and mortgage
 upon  each  of  the housing accommodations aided by such loan, or in the
 case of a cooperative housing corporation, a note and mortgage upon  the
 economic  interest  in such corporation of each tenant-shareholder aided
 by such loan, or upon the property, OR ANY  PORTION  OF  SUCH  PROPERTY,
 improved,  or  upon  both  such economic interest or property; PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THAT ALL OR PART OF ANY SUCH LOAN MAY BE UNSECURED IF NECESSARY
 TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY  PARTICIPATING  LENDER.  Such  loan
 shall  be  repaid over such period as the agency shall determine. In the
 case of a loan for  rehabilitation  of  an  existing  multiple  dwelling
 intended  to be converted to a condominium or cooperative form of owner-
 ship or a loan for the provision of infrastructure or for the  provision
 of  other  costs of construction for the development of one to four unit
 housing accommodations or a condominium or  cooperative  housing  corpo-
 ration,  such note and mortgage may provide that the loan shall automat-
 ically be reduced to zero over a period of owner-occupancy of the  hous-
 ing accommodations assisted by such loan. In the case of a grant or loan
 A. 6655  3
 
 made  under this section for the purpose of providing rental housing for
 persons of low income as defined in section two of the  private  housing
 finance  law,  such  loan  or grant shall require a regulatory agreement
 with  the  agency limiting profits and rentals charged. In the case of a
 loan made under this section for the purpose of providing rental housing
 for persons of low income as defined in section two of the private hous-
 ing finance law, such note and mortgage may provide that the loan  shall
 automatically  be reduced to zero over a period of up to thirty years of
 compliance by the owner with a  regulatory  agreement  with  the  agency
 limiting  profits and rentals charged. The repayment of any loan made in
 accordance with this section shall be made in  such  manner  as  may  be
 provided in such note and mortgage in connection with such loan, and may
 authorize the owner, with the consent of the agency, to prepay the prin-
 cipal  of  the  loan  subject  to  such  terms and conditions as therein
 provided. Such note and mortgage may contain such other terms and condi-
 tions not inconsistent with the provisions of this article as the agency
 may deem necessary  or  desirable  to  carrying  out  the  purposes  and
 provisions  of  this  article  including, but not limited to, provisions
 concerning the repayment of the loan, the interest, if any, thereon, and
 other charges in connection therewith. For purposes of this section, (1)
 the term "mortgage" shall include any pledge or assignment of shares  or
 assignment  of  a proprietary lease in a cooperative housing corporation
 where such pledge or assignment is intended as security for the perform-
 ance of an obligation and which imposes a lien on or  affects  title  to
 such  shares  or  such proprietary lease; AND (2) THE TERM "OWNER" SHALL
 MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL, PARTNERSHIP, CORPORATION OR OTHER ENTITY,  INCLUDING
 A  NON-PROFIT  COMPANY,  A MUTUAL COMPANY, OR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUND
 COMPANY, HAVING RECORD OR BENEFICIAL TITLE IN FEE SIMPLE TO REAL PROPER-
 TY OR THE LESSEE THEREOF UNDER A LEASE HAVING A TERM OF AT LEAST  FORTY-
 NINE YEARS.
  §  3.  The  general municipal law is amended by adding a new section
 696-e to read as follows:

 OF LOAN OR GRANT SERVICING FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUNC-
 TIONS  RELATED  TO LENDING OR PROVIDING A GRANT FOR CONSTRUCTION, AS MAY
 GENERALLY BE PERFORMED BY AN INSTITUTIONAL LENDER. SUCH AGENCY  MAY  ACT
 IN SUCH CAPACITY OR APPOINT OR CONSENT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTION  OR OTHER QUALIFIED ENTITY, AS DETERMINED BY SUCH AGENCY, TO

 TO PAY A REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY FEE TO SUCH FINANCIAL  INSTITUTION  OR
 OTHER QUALIFIED ENTITY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH SERVICES.

 finance law, as amended by chapter 400 of the laws of 1994,  is  amended

  § 6. Section 400 of the private housing finance law is amended to read
 as follows:
  §  400.  Policy  and  purposes  of article. It is hereby declared that
 there exists in municipalities in  this  state  a  seriously  inadequate
 supply  of  safe  and  sanitary  dwelling accommodations for persons and
 families of low income; that such shortage constitutes an emergency  and
 a  grave  menace  to  the health, safety, morals, welfare and comfort of
 citizens of this state; that there exists in such municipalities a large
 number of multiple dwellings which are inadequate, unsafe or  insanitary
 by  reason  of  the absence of proper heating facilities or by reason of
 the necessity for elimination of conditions dangerous to human  life  or
 detrimental  to  health,  including  nuisances  as defined[,] in section
 three hundred nine of the multiple dwelling law, or for other  rehabili-
 tation or improvement and which can be made adequate, safe and sanitary,
 by  the  installation of proper heating facilities or by other rehabili-
 tation, PRESERVATION or improvement or by the elimination of such condi-
 tions; that such installation, rehabilitation, PRESERVATION or  improve-
 ment  cannot  readily  be  provided by the ordinary unaided operation of
 private enterprise for occupancy by persons or families  of  low  income
 without public aid in the form of low interest loans OR GRANTS to owners
 of  such  multiple dwellings for the purpose of such installation, reha-
 bilitation, PRESERVATION or improvement; that the installation of proper
 heating facilities in such multiple dwellings or  other  rehabilitation,
 PRESERVATION  or  improvement  thereof  for  occupancy by persons of low
 income as defined in this article is a public use and a  public  purpose
 for  which  public  money may be loaned OR GRANTED; that such conditions
 require the provisions hereinafter enacted; and  the  necessity  in  the
 public  interest  for  the  provisions  hereinafter  enacted  is  hereby
 declared as a matter of legislative determination.
  § 7. Subdivision 3 of section 401 of the private housing finance  law,

 A. 6655  5

 or cost to them of heat, light, water  and  cooking  fuel)  of  dwelling
 units  occupied  by such persons or families in existing multiple dwell-
 ings aided by a loan pursuant to this article, except that in  the  case
 of  persons  or families with three or more dependents, such ratio shall
 not exceed seven to one, and except further that the income  limitations
 prescribed  by  this  paragraph  shall  be  subject to the provisions of
 subdivision two of section four hundred three of this article.
  In calculating annual income,  social  security  payments  and  income

 agency may exclude a proportion of the income of other  members  of  the
 family  over  the age of twenty-one years for the purpose of determining
 eligibility for commencement of occupancy or continued occupancy, or for
 establishing rental of such family, or for all such purposes].
  b. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph a of this  subdivision,
 [and  subject  to  the  provisions  of subdivision three of section four
 hundred three of this article] the term  "persons  or  families  of  low
 income"  shall  also mean any person or family who, immediately prior to
 the date on which a contract for a loan  with  respect  to  an  existing

 remove from any such dwelling unit because of such  installation,  reha-
 bilitation  or  improvement  shall,  for the purpose of this section, be
 deemed to have continuously occupied such unit and shall have preference
 in re-entering such multiple dwelling upon completion of  the  aforesaid
 work.

 a first lien on such property].
  (b)  [The  amount  of  any  such loan shall not exceed the cost of the
 installation of proper heating facilities, or elimination of  conditions
 dangerous to human life or detrimental to health, including nuisances as

 installation,  elimination,  or  other rehabilitation or improvement, as
 estimated by the agency, in which case such loan shall not exceed  nine-
 ty-five per centum of the value of the property, after completion of the
 installation of proper heating facilities, or elimination of such condi-
 tions  or other rehabilitation or improvement, as estimated by the agen-

 SUCH PERIOD MAY BE EXTENDED  AND  SHALL  BE  REPAID  WITHIN  THIRTY-FIVE
 YEARS,  in  such  manner as may be provided in such bond and mortgage or
 note and mortgage and contract [but in no case to  exceed  the  probable
 life  of  the  multiple dwelling which is hereby determined to be thirty
 years]. Such bond and mortgage or note and mortgage and the contract  in
 connection  with  such  permanent  and  temporary loans may contain such
 other terms and provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of  this
 article  as  the local legislative body or the agency may deem necessary
 or desirable to secure repayment of the loan, the interest  thereon  and
 other  charges in connection therewith and to carry out the purposes and
 provisions of this article[; notwithstanding the foregoing, a loan  made
 prior  to  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-eight may, in the
 discretion of the agency, be extended to a term up to forty-five  years.
 The  agency  may  modify the rate and time of payment of interest on the

 company  or  a  housing development fund company which agrees to provide
 housing accommodations exclusively  for  persons  and  families  of  low
 income,  at least thirty percent of whom are referred to it by the muni-
 cipality and have prior to their  initial  occupancy  in  such  accommo-
 dations resided in emergency shelter facilities operated by or on behalf
 of  the  municipality, the agency may provide that the note and mortgage
 shall automatically be reduced to zero in five equal  annual  decrements
 commencing  on the tenth year after the initial occupancy date, provided
 that such accommodations have  been  owned  and  operated  in  a  manner
 consistent  with  an  agreement  with the municipality contained in such
 note and mortgage to provide housing for such persons.

 such person or family shall be subject to  removal  from  such  dwelling
 unit  with the approval of the agency upon the expiration of a period of
 two years after the date on which such contract is entered into.
  b. In the event that at any time within a period of  two  years  after
 any  such  contract  is  entered  into, the income of any such person or

 of  surcharges  to be promulgated by the agency.  IN DETERMINING IMPOSI-
 TION OF ANY SUCH SURCHARGE, THE AGENCY SHALL CONSIDER  FACTORS  SUCH  AS
 THE NET OPERATING INCOME AND DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO OF THE PROPERTY
 AIDED  BY  A  LOAN PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE. Rental surcharges collected
 pursuant to this section shall be paid by the owner to the  municipality
 which  has granted such owner tax exemption or tax abatement pursuant to
 any law authorizing the granting of same, as reimbursement to such muni-
 cipality therefor. In the event that such tax exemption and  tax  abate-
 ment  have  not  been  granted,  or in the event that a sum equal to the
 total amount of tax exemption and tax abatement granted to the owner has
 been paid to the municipality, the excess, if any, of  surcharges  shall
 be paid to the municipality in reduction of the loan.
  [5. Any person or family whose removal is required by any provision of
 this article shall be subject to removal by summary proceedings.]

 morals,  welfare  and  comfort  of citizens of this state; that existing
 conditions of deterioration of housing marked by noncompliance with  the
 multiple dwelling law or local housing codes threaten a further decrease
 in  such  supply;  that  rehabilitation  and improvement of dwellings to
 prolong the useful life of such dwellings may  be  necessary  to  arrest
 such  conditions  of  deterioration; that the elimination of such condi-
 tions by rehabilitation or other improvement cannot readily be  provided
 by  the  ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise without public
 aid in the form of low interest loans OR GRANTS to owners of such multi-
 ple dwellings; that such rehabilitation or  other  improvement  of  such
 dwellings  to bring them into conformance with the multiple dwelling law
 and local housing codes is a public use, a public  purpose  and  a  city
 purpose  for  which  public  money may be loaned OR GRANTED by a munici-
 pality and for which indebtedness may be contracted by  a  municipality;
 that such conditions require the provisions hereinafter enacted, and the
 necessity  in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted
 is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

  PRIVATE AND MULTIPLE DWELLINGS
  §  19.  Section 470 of the private housing finance law, as amended by
 chapter 200 of the laws of 1997, is amended to read as follows:
  § 470. Policy and purposes of article. It is hereby declared and found
 that there exists in municipalities within  the  state  substandard  and
 unsanitary  areas and neighborhoods containing deteriorated [owner-occu-
 pied] one to four unit private and  multiple  dwellings,  and  that  the
 rehabilitation  OR  PRESERVATION of such dwellings is necessary in order
 to aid in the prevention and elimination of slums  and  blight  in  such
 areas and  neighborhoods.
  It  further  is found that there exists in such municipalities a seri-
 ously inadequate supply of safe and  sanitary  [owner-occupied]  one  to
 four  unit  private  and multiple dwellings, particularly for persons of
 low and moderate income, that existing non-compliance with local housing
 codes and with the multiple dwelling law and the multiple residence  law
 threatens  to decrease such supply, and that the rehabilitation, PRESER-
 VATION and improvement of such dwellings is  necessary  to  arrest  such
 conditions of deterioration.
  It  further  is found that the elimination of such conditions by reha-
 bilitation or other improvements  cannot  be  readily  provided  without
 public  aid  in  the  form  of  low interest loans OR GRANTS to [low and
 moderate income owner-occupants] OWNERS of such one to four unit  dwell-
 ings.
  The  rehabilitation, PRESERVATION or other improvements of such dwell-
 ings [owned and occupied by low and moderate  income  persons  or  fami-
 lies,]  is  hereby declared a public purpose and a municipal purpose for
 which public monies may be loaned OR GRANTED.
  In order, further, to promote the preservation and  rehabilitation  of
 such  dwellings, it is hereby declared that additional provisions should
 A. 6655  12
 
 be made to provide public monies for interest  reduction  subsidies  for
 private loans made by private investors for such rehabilitation.
  The  necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this arti-
 cle is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
  § 20. Subdivisions 6 and 9 of  section  471  of  the  private  housing
 finance law are REPEALED and subdivisions 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 are renum-

 record  OR  BENEFICIAL  title  in  fee  simple to an existing private or
 multiple dwelling and the real property upon which it  is  situated,  OR

  § 472. Loans to [owner-occupants]  OWNERS.  1.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions  of any general, special or local law, a municipality, acting
 through an agency, is authorized:
  (A) to make, or contract to make, loans to [low  and  moderate  income
 owner-occupants] OWNERS of one to four unit existing private or multiple
 dwellings  within  its  territorial limits, subject to the limitation of
 subdivisions two through seven of this section, in such amounts as shall
 be required for the rehabilitation, IMPROVEMENT OR ACQUISITION  of  such
 dwellings[,]  provided, [however, that such loans shall not exceed sixty
 thousand dollars per dwelling unit. Such] THAT ANY  SUCH  REHABILITATION
 OR  IMPROVEMENT MAY INCLUDE CLIMATE RESILIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.  SUCH loans
 may also BE MADE EXCLUSIVELY FOR  OR  include  the  refinancing  of  the
 outstanding  indebtedness  of  such  dwellings, and the municipality may
 make temporary loans or advances to  such  [owner-occupants]  OWNERS  in
 anticipation of permanent loans for such purposes; AND
  (B) TO MAKE OR CONTRACT TO MAKE GRANTS TO ANY OWNER DESCRIBED IN PARA-
 GRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, ON THE SAME TERMS AS PERMITTED UNDER SUCH
 PARAGRAPH FOR A LOAN.

 MADE BY A MUNICIPALITY PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS ARTICLE CONCERNING THE REPAYMENT OR FORGIVENESS OF,
 OR SECURITY FOR, A LOAN SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY GRANT  MADE  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS ARTICLE.
  2. Each loan shall be evidenced by a note executed by the [owner-occu-
 pant]  OWNER of the existing dwelling. Repayment of each such note shall
 be within a period of [the probable life of the existing dwelling  which
 is  hereby  determined to be thirty years, or such shorter period as the
 agency shall determine] THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, PROVIDED THAT SUCH PERIOD MAY
 BE EXTENDED AND SHALL BE REPAID WITHIN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS.  The repayment
 shall be made in such manner  as  may  be  provided  in  such  note  and
 contract,  if  any, in connection with such loan, and may authorize such
 [owner-occupant] OWNER, with the consent of the agency,  to  prepay  the
 A. 6655  13
 
 principal  of  the  loan subject to such terms and conditions as therein
 provided. In order to make any such loan affordable to the  [owner-occu-
 pant]  OWNER,  the agency may provide in such note and contract that all
 of  the outstanding principal of said loan may be self-liquidated over a
 [fifteen year] period of [owner-occupancy] NOT LESS THAN  FIFTEEN  YEARS
 OF  CONTINUOUS  COMPLIANCE  BY  THE OWNER WITH A REGULATORY AGREEMENT OR
 OTHER RESTRICTIVE COVENANT WITH OR APPROVED BY THE AGENCY AND  UPON  THE
 SATISFACTION  OF  ANY ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS SPECIFIED THEREIN. Such note
 and contract may contain such other terms and provisions not  inconsist-
 ent with the provisions of this article as the agency may deem necessary
 or  desirable  to secure repayment of the loan, the interest thereon, if
 any, and other charges in connection therewith, and  to  carry  out  the
 purposes and provisions of this article.
  3.  The agency in its discretion may require that the [owner-occupant]
 OWNER execute, acknowledge and deliver a uniform commercial code financ-
 ing statement for the real property improvement to be in  such  form  as
 the  agency  shall  specify  and  in accordance with the requirements of
 section 9--502 of the uniform commercial code of the state of New  York.
 Said  financing  statement  shall be filed or recorded without charge in
 accordance with the provisions of paragraph one  of  subsection  (a)  of
 section 9--501 of the uniform commercial code, and from the date of such
 filing  the  municipality  shall  have a lien against said real property
 improvement for the amount advanced or so much thereof as remains unpaid
 together with the interest thereon. Upon payment of all sums advanced by
 the municipality and interest thereon,  and  upon  demand  of  the  then
 record  owner  of  the real property, the agency shall deliver a copy of
 the financing statement with an endorsement thereon  that  the  lien  is
 satisfied.  Upon  filing  of such copy in the office where the financing
 statement was filed and upon payment of the  proper  fee  therefor,  the
 lien of such financing statement shall be discharged.
  4.  The  agency  may  require  the [owner-occupant] OWNER to execute a
 mortgage as security for a loan in lieu of or in addition to a financing
 statement as provided in subdivision three of this section.  Such  mort-
 gage  shall  contain such terms and provisions not inconsistent with the
 provisions of this article as the agency shall deem necessary or desira-
 ble to secure repayment of the loan.
  5. Loans may be made with respect to a one to  four  unit  private  or
 multiple  dwelling  encumbered  by mortgages, provided no mortgage is in
 default, except if such default shall be remedied by the proposed  reha-
 bilitation or improvement.
  6.  The  agency may charge the [owner-occupant] OWNER of such existing
 private or multiple dwelling reasonable fees for administration, financ-
 ing, regulation, supervision and audit.
  7. In making a loan under this article, an agency shall have the power
 to participate in a loan made by any private  investor[,  provided  that
 the  portion of the loan funded by the agency shall not exceed an amount
 equal to seventy-five percent of the total loan.] The agency  may  enter
 into  an  agreement  with  a private investor to deposit funds with such
 private investor  to  cover  the  agency's  participation  in  loans  to
 [owner-occupants] OWNERS of one to four unit existing private and multi-
 ple  dwellings  with  such  funds  advanced  by such private investor to
 [owner-occupants] OWNERS of existing dwellings. The portion of the  loan
 funded  by  the  agency  may  be  equal to or subordinate in lien to the
 portion of the loan funded by the private  investor  and  the  note  and
 contract  may  contain such terms with respect to interest rate, if any,
 and time of payment of principal and interest as determined by the agen-
 A. 6655  14
 
 cy. The agency may make provision, either in the mortgage  or  mortgages
 or by separate agreement, for the performance by the private investor of
 such  services as are generally performed by a banking institution which
 itself  holds  a  mortgage,  including, without limitation, construction
 loan  advances,  construction  supervision,  initiation  of  foreclosure
 proceedings,  procurement  of  insurance,  and  all  other  matters  in
 connection with the financing, supervision, regulation and audit of  any
 such  loan. In order to make the loan affordable to the [owner-occupant]
 OWNER, the agency may provide an interest reduction subsidy pursuant  to
 section  four  hundred seventy-five of this article, or may provide that
 all or part of the agency's portion of the outstanding principal of  any
 such participation loan may be self-liquidated over a fifteen year peri-
 od  of  [owner-occupancy]  NOT  LESS  THAN  FIFTEEN  YEARS OF CONTINUOUS
 COMPLIANCE BY THE OWNER WITH A REGULATORY AGREEMENT OR OTHER RESTRICTIVE
 COVENANT WITH OR APPROVED BY THE AGENCY AND UPON THE SATISFACTION OF ANY
 ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS SPECIFIED THEREIN.

 shall  permit the duly authorized officers, employees, agents or inspec-
 tors of the agency to enter in or  upon  and  inspect  such  private  or
 multiple  dwelling at all reasonable hours; (ii) the agency by such duly
 authorized representatives as aforesaid shall have full power to  inves-
 tigate  into  and  order  the [owner-occupant] OWNER of such dwelling to

 rehabilitation  or  improvement  and  shall have full power to audit the
 books of said owner with respect to such matters; and (iii) if the prop-
 erty to be rehabilitated is a multiple  dwelling,  the  [owner-occupant]
 OWNER  will  submit  to  the  agency  annually a statement of income and
 expenses of such dwelling, in such form as  shall  be  approved  by  the
 agency.
  2.  A  municipality shall neither make nor participate in a loan to an
 [owner-occupant] OWNER of  an  existing  private  or  multiple  dwelling
 pursuant  to this article unless the agency finds that the area in which
 such dwelling is situated is a blighted, deteriorated  or  deteriorating
 area  or  has  a  blighting  influence on the surrounding area, or is in
 danger of becoming a slum or a blighted area because of the existence of
 substandard, unsanitary, deteriorating or  deteriorated  conditions,  an
 aged  housing  stock,  or  other  factors indicating an inability of the
 private sector to cause such rehabilitation to be made.

 law,  as added by chapter 786 of the laws of 1987, is amended to read as
 follows:

  §  27.  Section  800 of the private housing finance law, as amended by
 chapter 456 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as follows:
  § 800. Policy and purposes of article. It is hereby declared and found
 that there exists in municipalities in this state substandard and insan-
 itary areas and neighborhoods characterized by undermaintained and dete-
 riorating  housing  accommodations  and  under-utilized  non-residential
 buildings and under-utilized vacant land. It is further found that there
 exists  in  such  municipalities  a diminishing and seriously inadequate
 supply of safe and sanitary dwelling  accommodations,  particularly  for
 persons of low income; that the loss of housing accommodations is caused
 by  the  inability  of the ordinary unaided operations of private enter-
 prise to make loans for rehabilitation or construction purposes  or  for
 conversion  which  accelerates the process of deterioration and abandon-
 ment, turning active and viable neighborhoods into  slums  and  blighted
 areas;  and  that the prevention of deterioration and loss through aban-
 donment can only be achieved by the elimination of conditions which  are
 unsafe  or detrimental to health, the replacement of antiquated heating,
 plumbing, and electrical systems and, where necessary, the overall reha-
 bilitation of certain housing accommodations, the  construction  of  new
 housing  accommodations  on vacant land and the conversion of under-uti-
 lized non-residential property to residential use, and that the unavail-
 ability of funds for the conversion of under-utilized property to  resi-
 dential  use,  for  the  preservation  and  rehabilitation  of  housing
 accommodations and for the construction of new housing accommodations on
 vacant land constitutes a threat to the health, safety and well-being of
 the persons who occupy them and denies  to  others  the  possibility  of
 living in safe and sanitary housing accommodations.
  In  order to promote the preservation and rehabilitation of such hous-
 ing accommodations, the creation of new housing  accommodations  by  the
 conversion  of  under-utilized  non-residential  property  into multiple
 dwellings and the construction of new housing accommodations  on  vacant
 land in such areas and to encourage the investment of private capital in
 such  areas,  provision  should  be  made  for a municipality to attract
 private investment for such  purposes  by  utilizing  funds,  which  are
 available  from the federal government through specific or discretionary
 grants, or are available from other financing sources, for joint partic-
 ipation loans with private investors, OR LOANS OR GRANTS BY THE  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  to  effect the required construction, rehabilitation or conver-
 sion.
 A. 6655  17
 
  The necessity in the public interest for  the  provisions  hereinafter
 enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

 non-residential  property  to  be converted into a multiple dwelling and

 the  new multiple dwelling is to be constructed, OR IS THE LESSEE OF ANY
 SUCH REAL PROPERTY HAVING AN UNEXPIRED TERM OF AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS.

 such  owners  in  anticipation  of the permanent participation loans for

  (B) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY GENERAL,  SPECIAL  OR  LOCAL
 LAW,  AND  IN  ADDITION TO THE POWER TO MAKE OR CONTRACT TO MAKE PARTIC-
 IPATION LOANS GRANTED BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  ACTING THROUGH ITS AGENCY, AND THE NEW YORK CITY HOUSING DEVEL-
 OPMENT CORPORATION SHALL EACH HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE OR CONTRACT TO MAKE
 LOANS OR GRANTS TO ANY OWNER DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF A PRIVATE INVESTOR, ON THE SAME  TERMS
 AS PERMITTED UNDER SUCH PARAGRAPH FOR A PARTICIPATION LOAN.
  3.  [(a)]  Each  participation loan shall be secured by a bond or note
 and single participating mortgage or by  separate  bonds  or  notes  and
 mortgages  upon  ANY PORTION OR ALL OF the existing multiple dwelling or
 the non-residential property and the land upon which it is  situated  or
 in  the  case  of  the construction of a new multiple dwelling, upon ANY
 PORTION OR ALL OF the vacant  land  and  the  multiple  dwelling  to  be

 payment of the principal of and interest on that portion of the mortgage
 indebtedness attributable to participation in the loan by  one  or  more
 private  investors,  [(ii)] (B) the interest of the municipality created

 interest  that  one or more of such private investors may have upon such
 participation, [(iii)] (C) the interest of each upon such  participation
 need  not  be  of  equal priority as to lien nor be equal as to interest
 rate, time or rate of amortization of principal or time  of  payment  of
 interest,  or  otherwise,  [(iv)]  (D) the bond or note and mortgage may
 provide that the municipality's portion of a participation loan made  to
 an owner shall be reduced to zero commencing in the fifteenth year after
 the execution of the bond or note and mortgage, provided that, as of the
 date  of any such reduction, such multiple dwelling has been and contin-
 ues to be owned and operated in a manner consistent  with  a  regulatory
 agreement  with  the  municipality.  Notwithstanding  such  provision as
 contained in the bond or note and mortgage, the  municipality's  portion
 of the loan shall be reduced to zero only if, prior to or simultaneously
 with delivery of such bond or note and mortgage, the agency made a writ-
 ten  determination  that such reduction would be necessary to ensure the
 A. 6655  19
 
 continued affordability or economic viability of the multiple  dwelling.
 Such  written determination shall document the basis upon which the loan
 was determined to be eligible for evaporation.
  [(b)  The  aggregate  amount of each such participation loan shall not
 exceed the cost of the rehabilitation, conversion or construction,  plus
 the costs of any or all undertakings necessary for the planning, financ-
 ing,  acquisition,  satisfaction  of tax liens and other municipal liens
 and encumbrances, construction, equipment and development in  connection
 therewith,  provided  that,  if any portion of such loan is used for the
 cost of acquisition or for refinancing, the amount of  a  municipality's
 portion of such loan shall not exceed one and one-half times the cost of
 rehabilitation, conversion or construction.
  (c) The amount of any such loan, together with the amount of all prior
 liens  and  encumbrances, shall not exceed, except in the case of a loan
 made to a non-profit company, a mutual company, or a housing development
 fund company, ninety per centum of value unless the agency makes a writ-
 ten determination that the owner has insufficient resources to  pay  for
 the remaining ten per centum of value, in which case such loan shall not
 exceed  ninety-five  per  centum  of value. The amount of any such loan,
 together with the amount of all prior liens and encumbrances, made to  a
 non-profit  company,  a  mutual  company,  or a housing development fund
 company shall not exceed value, provided that when after  completion  of
 such  rehabilitation, conversion or construction, such multiple dwelling
 is, or is to be operated, exclusively for the  benefit  of  persons  and
 families  who  are entitled to occupancy by reason of ownership of stock
 in the corporate owners, such loan shall  not  exceed  ninety-eight  per
 centum of value unless the agency makes a written determination that the
 owner has insufficient resources to pay for the remaining two per centum
 of value, in which case such loan shall not exceed value.]
  4. Each such bond or note and mortgage or bonds or notes and mortgages
 shall  be  repaid over or within a period of [thirty] THIRTY-FIVE years,
 PROVIDED THAT SUCH PERIOD MAY BE EXTENDED AND  SHALL  BE  REPAID  WITHIN
 THIRTY-FIVE  YEARS,  in  such  manner as may be provided in such bond or
 note and mortgage or bonds or notes and mortgages [but in no case  shall
 the  term of such loan exceed the probable life of the multiple dwelling
 which is hereby determined to be thirty years]. Such bond  or  note  and
 mortgage  or bonds or notes and mortgages and any contract in connection
 with such permanent and temporary loans may contain such other terms and
 provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this article  as  the
 local  legislative body or the agency may deem necessary or desirable to
 secure repayment of the loan, the interest thereon and other charges  in
 connection  therewith  and  to  carry out the purposes and provisions of
 this article.

 chapter  639  of the laws of 1989, subdivision 4 as amended and subdivi-
 sion 13 as added by chapter 241 of the laws of 1998, subdivision  12  as
 added by chapter 400 of the laws of 1994, and paragraph e of subdivision
 12  as amended by chapter 118 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 1152. Affordable housing development loans. 1.  (A)  Notwithstanding
 the provisions of any general, special or local law, one or more private
 lenders  and  the city of New York, acting through the agency shall have
 the power to participate and invest in making loans to sponsors for  the
 construction  of  eligible  projects. Such loans MAY BE MADE EXCLUSIVELY
 FOR OR may include such amounts as may be required for site  acquisition
 OR  THE  REFINANCING  OF ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. Each such participation loan
 shall be secured by a bond or note and single participating mortgage  or
 by  separate bonds or notes and mortgages upon ALL OR ANY PORTION OF the
 eligible project. Such bond or note and mortgage or bonds  or  notes  or
 mortgages  may  contain such other terms and provisions not inconsistent
 with the provisions of this article as the agency may deem necessary  or
 desirable.
  (B)  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL
 LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO THE POWER TO MAKE OR CONTRACT  TO  MAKE  PARTIC-
 IPATION  LOANS GRANTED BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE CITY OF
 NEW YORK, ACTING THROUGH THE AGENCY, SHALL HAVE THE  POWER  TO  MAKE  OR
 CONTRACT TO MAKE LOANS OR GRANTS TO ANY OWNER DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A)
 OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF A PRIVATE LENDER, ON
 THE SAME TERMS AS PERMITTED UNDER SUCH  PARAGRAPH  FOR  A  PARTICIPATION
 LOAN.
  2.  [The portion of such loan funded by the agency shall not exceed an
 amount equal to sixty percent of the actual total development cost of an
 eligible project.] The agency may enter into an agreement with a private
 lender to deposit its share of a loan with  the  private  lender  to  be
 advanced  by  the  private lender. The portion of the loan funded by the
 agency may be equal to or subordinate in lien to the portion of the loan
 funded by the private lender and may contain such terms with respect  to
 interest  rate,  if  any, rate of amortization of principal, if any, and
 time of payment of interest and principal as determined by  the  agency.
 The  agency may make provision either in the mortgage or mortgages or by
 separate agreement for the performance by the  private  lender  of  such
 services  as  are  generally  performed  by  a banking institution which
 itself holds a mortgage,  including,  without  limitation,  construction
 loan  advances,  construction  supervision,  initiation  of  foreclosure
 proceedings,  procurement  of  insurance,  and  all  other  matters  in
 A. 6655  21
 
 connection  with the financing, supervision, regulation and audit of any
 such loan to any such eligible project.
  3.  [If  a portion of the loan is to be utilized for acquisition of an
 eligible site such portion shall in no event exceed fifteen  percent  of
 the total amount of such loan or the appraised value of the site, which-
 ever is the lesser.
  4.] If the eligible project is to consist of one to four unit dwelling
 accommodations  or  cooperative or condominium units, the agency's share
 of the loan may be converted after completion of construction into mort-
 gages on such dwelling accommodations or condominium units or  financing
 statements  filed with respect to such cooperative shares, provided such
 units or such cooperative shares are purchased by persons of  [eligible]
 LOW  income.  Such  mortgages  AND  ANY BLANKET MORTGAGE THAT THE AGENCY
 RETAINS ON ANY PORTION OF, OR  ON  ALL  OF,  THE  ELIGIBLE  PROJECT  may
 provide  that [they] SUCH MORTGAGES AND SUCH BLANKET MORTGAGE will auto-
 matically be reduced to zero over a period of continuous [owner-occupan-
 cy of the housing accommodations assisted by such  loan]  COMPLIANCE  BY
 THE  MORTGAGEE WITH A REGULATORY AGREEMENT OR OTHER RESTRICTIVE COVENANT
 WITH OR APPROVED BY THE AGENCY AND UPON THE SATISFACTION  OF  ANY  ADDI-
 TIONAL  CONDITIONS SPECIFIED THEREIN.  Notwithstanding such provision as
 contained in such mortgage, the loan shall be reduced to zero  only  if,
 prior  to  or  simultaneously with delivery of such mortgage, the agency
 made a written determination that such reduction would be  necessary  to
 ensure the continued affordability or economic viability of the eligible
 project.  Such written determination shall document the basis upon which
 the loan was determined to be eligible for evaporation. Such  period  of
 continuous  [owner-occupancy]  COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATORY AGREEMENT
 OR OTHER RESTRICTIVE COVENANT shall not be less than fifteen years.
  [5.] 4. If the eligible project is to consist  of  one  to  four  unit
 dwelling  accommodations or cooperative or condominium units, the agency
 shall require that the dwelling units  be  offered  only  to  bona  fide
 purchasers who intend to occupy a unit as their principal place of resi-
 dence;  provided, however, that in the case of two to four unit dwelling
 accommodations the bona fide purchaser may occupy only a single unit  as
 a  principal  place  of residence. If the purchaser ceases to occupy the
 unit as a principal place of  residence,  the  agency  may  provide  for
 recapture of all or a portion of the agency's share of the loan.
  [6.]  5.  If  the  eligible  project is a rental project, the agency's
 share of the loan may be converted after completion of construction into
 a [non-interest bearing, non-amortizing thirty year loan] PERMANENT LOAN
 WITH A TERM OF THIRTY-FIVE YEARS,  PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH  PERIOD  MAY  BE
 EXTENDED  AND  SHALL BE REPAID WITHIN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, payable [at the
 end of its term, provided that such loan shall be also  payable  out  of
 profits  upon any sale or refinancing of the project prior to the end of
 such thirty year period] IN SUCH MANNER AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN  THE  NOTE
 AND  ANY  MORTGAGE  IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOAN. SUCH NOTE AND MORTGAGE
 MAY CONTAIN SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE AGENCY MAY  DEEM  NECESSARY
 OR  DESIRABLE TO EFFECTUATE THE PURPOSES AND PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE.
 The sponsor or any subsequent owner or owners of such  a  project  shall
 agree  to  rent  such units only to persons of [eligible] LOW income for
 such [thirty year] period [and shall agree that all] AS THE  AGENCY  MAY
 DETERMINE.  ALL  SUCH  units  shall  be  subject to THE EMERGENCY TENANT
 PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY-FOUR AND the rent  stabilization  law
 of nineteen hundred sixty-nine, as amended [for a period of thirty years
 after initial occupancy], unless converted to a cooperative or condomin-
 ium  pursuant  to subdivision [eight] SEVEN of this section. [At the end
 A. 6655  22

 of such period each unit shall continue to be subject to such law there-
 after until the first vacancy occurs at which time  the  unit  shall  be
 decontrolled.]  Initial rentals for all rental units shall be set by the
 agency.
  [7.]  6.  If  the  eligible project is a rental project annual profits
 shall be limited to an amount set by the agency for as long as the  loan
 is  outstanding.  Excess  profits  shall  be  used  to establish project
 reserves, provide capital improvements or reduce the principal amount of
 the agency's loan, as determined by the agency.
  [8.] 7. If the eligible project is a rental project, no conversion  to
 a  cooperative  or condominium shall be permitted for a period of twenty
 years after initial occupancy, and unless (i) the agency's share of  the
 loan  is prepaid upon such conversion, (ii) the conversion shall be done
 pursuant to section three hundred fifty-two-eeee of the general business
 law as a non-eviction plan, and (iii) apartments  occupied  by  non-pur-
 chasing  tenants continue to be subject to the rent stabilization law of
 nineteen hundred sixty-nine as amended, until the occurrence of a vacan-
 cy.
  [9.] 8. A loan made pursuant to this article shall be exempt from  the
 mortgage recording taxes imposed by article eleven of the tax law.
  [10.]  9.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of any general, special or
 local law or charter, the agency shall have  power,  without  soliciting
 competing  bids,  to contract with any sponsor or to make provision in a
 loan for the construction or reconstruction  of  any  site  improvements
 located  in  the  public  right-of-way OR ON THE ELIGIBLE SITE which are
 necessary for the development of an eligible project. Such site improve-
 ments may include, but shall not  be  limited  to,  streets,  sidewalks,
 LANDSCAPING,  PARKS  AND  OPEN SPACE, SOCIAL, RECREATIONAL, COMMUNAL AND
 OTHER NON-RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND THE  OUTFITTING  THEREOF,  lighting
 fixtures, and water and sewer lines.
  [11.]  10.  No  loan  shall be made pursuant to the provisions of this
 article unless the agency finds that: (a) the construction of the eligi-
 ble project does not directly displace current low and  moderate  income
 residents  of  the  eligible  site;  (b)  the eligible project leverages
 private and other public investment, if any, so as to reduce the  amount
 of  assistance  provided  pursuant to this article to the minimal amount
 which is necessary for construction of the  eligible  project;  (c)  the
 eligible  project  will  be built by a private developer/builder who has
 agreed to limit its profit in accordance with a formula satisfactory  to
 the  agency; (d) the eligible project will provide assistance to an area
 which is blighted or deteriorated or has a blighting  influence  on  the
 surrounding  area, or is in danger of becoming a slum or a blighted area
 because of neighborhood conditions indicating an inability or unwilling-
 ness of the private sector to cause the type of construction for which a
 loan is to be provided; and (e) the  eligible  project  will  make  home
 ownership  or  rental housing affordable to persons who cannot presently
 afford the housing available based upon the ordinary  unaided  operation
 of private enterprise.
  [12.]  11.  a.  The  agency  may make non-interest bearing advances to
 sponsors to defray the pre-development costs  of  eligible  projects  in
 accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
  b.  No  such  advances shall be made unless the agency finds that: (i)
 the sponsor proposes to finance the eligible project in whole or in part
 by a loan granted pursuant to this  article  or  that  the  project,  if
 otherwise  financed, will provide housing for persons or families of low
 income, and that such project is otherwise consistent with the  purposes
 A. 6655  23
 
 of  this article; (ii) the project site is suitable, there is a need for
 the housing type proposed in the area to be served and  the  project  is
 feasible;  and  (iii) it is reasonable to anticipate that financing will
 be obtained and the agency makes a finding to that effect.
  c.  No  such  advances  may  be  made to a sponsor unless such sponsor
 enters into an agreement with the agency which provides that such  spon-
 sor  shall  be  regulated  with respect to rents, profits, dividends and
 disposition of  its  property  or  franchise,  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions of this article.
  d.  An  advance granted pursuant to this section shall be used only to
 defray the pre-development costs of eligible projects. For  purposes  of
 this  subdivision,  the  term  pre-development  costs shall include, but
 shall not be limited to: the reasonable and necessary  costs  for  plan-
 ning, site preparation, developing architectural drawings and conducting
 engineering and environmental studies, but shall not include acquisition
 of  land  or  buildings,  drainage  and  landscaping  of  vacant  land,
 construction of new buildings or the reconstruction or rehabilitation of
 existing buildings.
  e. Each such advance shall be repaid in full  to  the  agency  by  the
 sponsor. Such repayment shall be made upon receipt by the sponsor or its
 successor  in  interest  of the proceeds of its mortgage or construction
 loan for the eligible project, unless the agency extends the period  for
 the  repayment of such advances. In no event shall the time of repayment
 be extended to a date later than the date  of  final  advance  of  funds
 pursuant  to  such  mortgage  or construction loan. Notwithstanding this
 paragraph, the agency may reduce such advance to zero over a  period  of
 continued compliance with the agency's agreement with the sponsor pursu-
 ant  to paragraph c of this subdivision if the agency has made a written
 determination that such reduction  would  be  necessary  to  ensure  the
 continued  affordability  or economic viability of the eligible project.
 Such written determination shall document the basis upon which the agen-
 cy's non-interest bearing advance was  determined  eligible  for  evapo-
 ration.
  f. If the agency, in its discretion, determines at any time that mort-
 gage  or  construction  financing  for  the  eligible project may not be
 obtained, then all advances made to the sponsor pursuant to this  subdi-
 vision  shall  become immediately due and payable upon the demand of the
 agency.
  [13.] 12. If the eligible project is a rental  project,  the  bond  or
 note  and  mortgage or bonds or notes or mortgages issued by the sponsor
 of any eligible project to secure a participation loan may provide  that
 the  city's  portion of such loan shall be reduced to zero commencing on
 the fifteenth year after the execution of such bond or note and mortgage
 or bonds or notes or mortgages, provided that, as of  the  date  of  any
 such  reduction, the eligible project has been and continues to be owned
 and operated in a manner consistent with a regulatory agreement with the
 city. Notwithstanding such provision as contained in the  bond  or  note
 and  mortgage  or bonds or notes or mortgages, the loan shall be reduced
 to zero only if, prior to or simultaneously with delivery of  such  bond
 or  note  and mortgage or bonds or notes or mortgages, the agency made a
 written determination that such reduction would be necessary  to  ensure
 the  continued  affordability  or  economic  viability  of  the eligible
 project. Such written determination shall document the basis upon  which
 the loan was determined to be eligible for evaporation.
  §  34. This act shall take effect immediately, provided, however, that
 the amendments to subdivision 1 of section 696-a of the general  munici-
 A. 6655  24
 
 pal  law made by section one of this act shall be subject to the expira-
 tion and reversion of such subdivision pursuant to section 2 of  chapter
 613  of the laws of 1996, as amended, when upon such date the provisions
 of section two of this act shall take effect.
