 465 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  § 696-a. Loans. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special
 or local law, an agency is hereby authorized to make or contract to make
 grants  or  loans[: (i)] to the owner of any property that is part of an
 urban development action area project for the purpose of: (I)  rehabili-
 tation  of an existing private or multiple dwelling OR CONSTRUCTION OF A
 NEW PRIVATE OR MULTIPLE DWELLING, (ii) [for the  purpose  of]  providing

 foundations and other improvements  associated  with  the  provision  of
 infrastructure,  or (iii) [for the purpose of] providing for other costs
 of construction for the development of  private  and  multiple  dwelling
 housing  accommodations.  In the case of a grant made under this section
 for the rehabilitation of an existing multiple dwelling intended  to  be
 converted  to  a condominium or cooperative form of ownership or for the
 development of one to four unit housing accommodations or a  condominium
 or cooperative housing corporation, such grant shall require a regulato-
 ry  agreement with the agency limiting profits. Any loan made in accord-
 ance with this section shall be secured by a note and mortgage upon  the
 property  improved,  OTHER THAN ANY SUCH PROPERTY TITLE TO WHICH IS HELD
 BY THE MUNICIPALITY, or, in the case of a condominium, a note and  mort-
 gage  upon  each of the [housing accommodations] CONDOMINIUM UNITS aided

 OTHER THAN ANY SUCH PROPERTY TITLE TO WHICH IS HELD BY THE MUNICIPALITY,
 or upon both such economic interest or property; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 ALL  OR  PART  OF ANY SUCH LOAN MAY BE UNSECURED IF NECESSARY TO SATISFY

 for  rehabilitation  of  an  existing  multiple  dwelling intended to be
 converted to a condominium or cooperative form of ownership  or  a  loan
 for  the provision of infrastructure or for the provision of other costs
 of construction for the development of one to four unit housing accommo-
 dations or a condominium or cooperative housing corporation,  such  note
 and mortgage may provide that the loan shall automatically be reduced to
 zero  over  a  period  of  owner-occupancy of the housing accommodations
 assisted by such loan. In the case of a grant or loan  made  under  this
 section  for  the purpose of providing rental housing for persons of low
 income as defined in section two of the  private  housing  finance  law,
 such  loan or grant shall require a regulatory agreement with the agency
 limiting profits and rentals charged. In the case of a loan  made  under
 this  section for the purpose of providing rental housing for persons of
 low income as defined in section two of the private housing finance law,
 such note and mortgage may provide that the loan shall automatically  be
 reduced to zero over a period of up to thirty years of compliance by the
 owner  with  a regulatory agreement with the agency limiting profits and
 rentals charged. The repayment of any loan made in accordance with  this
 section shall be made in such manner as may be provided in such note and
 mortgage in connection with such loan, and may authorize the owner, with
 the  consent  of the agency, to prepay the principal of the loan subject
 to such terms and conditions as therein provided. Such note and mortgage
 may contain such other terms and conditions not  inconsistent  with  the
 provisions of this article as the agency may deem necessary or desirable
 to  carrying  out the purposes and provisions of this article including,
 but not limited to, provisions concerning the repayment of the loan, the
 interest, if any, thereon, and other charges  in  connection  therewith.

 include any pledge or assignment of shares or assignment of  a  proprie-
 tary  lease  in  a  cooperative housing corporation where such pledge or
 assignment is intended as security for the performance of an  obligation
 and  which  imposes  a  lien  on or affects title to such shares or such
 proprietary lease; AND (2) THE TERM "OWNER" SHALL  MEAN  AN  INDIVIDUAL,
 PARTNERSHIP,  CORPORATION OR OTHER ENTITY, INCLUDING A NON-PROFIT COMPA-
 NY, A MUTUAL COMPANY, OR A  HOUSING  DEVELOPMENT  FUND  COMPANY,  HAVING

  §  400.  Policy  and  purposes  of article. It is hereby declared that
 there exists in municipalities in  this  state  a  seriously  inadequate
 supply  of  safe  and  sanitary  dwelling accommodations for persons and
 families of low income; that such shortage constitutes an emergency  and
 a  grave  menace  to  the health, safety, morals, welfare and comfort of
 citizens of this state; that there exists in such municipalities a large
 number of multiple dwellings which are inadequate, unsafe or  insanitary
 by  reason  of  the absence of proper heating facilities or by reason of
 the necessity for elimination of conditions dangerous to human  life  or
 detrimental  to  health,  including  nuisances  as defined[,] in section
 three hundred nine of the multiple dwelling law, or for other  rehabili-
 tation or improvement and which can be made adequate, safe and sanitary,
 by  the  installation of proper heating facilities or by other rehabili-
 tation, PRESERVATION or improvement or by the elimination of such condi-
 tions; that such installation, rehabilitation, PRESERVATION or  improve-
 ment  cannot  readily  be  provided by the ordinary unaided operation of
 private enterprise for occupancy by persons or families  of  low  income
 without public aid in the form of low interest loans OR GRANTS to owners
 of  such  multiple dwellings for the purpose of such installation, reha-
 bilitation, PRESERVATION or improvement; that the installation of proper
 heating facilities in such multiple dwellings or  other  rehabilitation,
 PRESERVATION  or  improvement  thereof  for  occupancy by persons of low
 income as defined in this article is a public use and a  public  purpose
 for  which  public  money may be loaned OR GRANTED; that such conditions
 require the provisions hereinafter enacted; and  the  necessity  in  the
 public  interest  for  the  provisions  hereinafter  enacted  is  hereby
 declared as a matter of legislative determination.

 units  occupied  by such persons or families in existing multiple dwell-
 ings aided by a loan pursuant to this article, except that in  the  case
 of  persons  or families with three or more dependents, such ratio shall
 not exceed seven to one, and except further that the income  limitations
 prescribed  by  this  paragraph  shall  be  subject to the provisions of
 subdivision two of section four hundred three of this article.

 establishing rental of such family, or for all such purposes].
  b. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph a of this  subdivision,
 [and  subject  to  the  provisions  of subdivision three of section four
 A. 6655--A  6

 hundred three of this article] the term  "persons  or  families  of  low
 income"  shall  also mean any person or family who, immediately prior to

 there  exists  in  municipalities  in  this state a seriously inadequate
 supply of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations; that such  shortage
 constitutes  an  emergency  and  a  grave  menace to the health, safety,
 morals, welfare and comfort of citizens of  this  state;  that  existing
 conditions  of deterioration of housing marked by noncompliance with the
 multiple dwelling law or local housing codes threaten a further decrease
 in such supply; that rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  dwellings  to
 prolong  the  useful  life  of such dwellings may be necessary to arrest
 such conditions of deterioration; that the elimination  of  such  condi-
 tions  by rehabilitation or other improvement cannot readily be provided
 by the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise  without  public
 aid in the form of low interest loans OR GRANTS to owners of such multi-
 ple  dwellings;  that  such  rehabilitation or other improvement of such
 dwellings to bring them into conformance with the multiple dwelling  law
 and  local  housing  codes  is a public use, a public purpose and a city
 purpose for which public money may be loaned OR  GRANTED  by  a  munici-
 pality  and  for which indebtedness may be contracted by a municipality;

 necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter  enacted
 is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

 aforesaid shall have full power to investigate into and order the  owner
 of  such multiple dwelling to furnish such reports and information as it
 may require concerning such rehabilitation or improvement and shall have
 full power to audit the  books  of  said  owner  with  respect  to  such

 statement of the income and expenses of such multiple dwelling, in  such
 form as shall be approved by such agency.
  [2.  No  such  loan  shall be made by a municipality unless such owner

  §  20.  Section  470 of the private housing finance law, as amended by
 chapter 200 of the laws of 1997, is amended to read as follows:
  § 470. Policy and purposes of article. It is hereby declared and found
 that there exists in municipalities within  the  state  substandard  and
 unsanitary  areas and neighborhoods containing deteriorated [owner-occu-
 pied] one to four unit private and  multiple  dwellings,  and  that  the
 rehabilitation  OR  PRESERVATION of such dwellings is necessary in order
 to aid in the prevention and elimination of slums  and  blight  in  such
 areas and  neighborhoods.
  It  further  is found that there exists in such municipalities a seri-
 ously inadequate supply of safe and  sanitary  [owner-occupied]  one  to
 four  unit  private  and multiple dwellings, particularly for persons of
 low and moderate income, that existing non-compliance with local housing
 codes and with the multiple dwelling law and the multiple residence  law
 threatens  to decrease such supply, and that the rehabilitation, PRESER-
 VATION and improvement of such dwellings is  necessary  to  arrest  such
 conditions of deterioration.
 A. 6655--A  13
 
  It  further  is found that the elimination of such conditions by reha-
 bilitation or other improvements IN ONE TO FOUR UNIT PRIVATE AND  MULTI-
 PLE  DWELLINGS cannot be readily provided without public aid in the form
 of low interest loans OR GRANTS to [low and moderate income  owner-occu-
 pants] OWNERS of such one to four unit dwellings.

 such  dwellings, it is hereby declared that additional provisions should
 be made to provide public monies for interest  reduction  subsidies  for
 private loans made by private investors for such rehabilitation.
  The  necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this arti-
 cle is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

 ing statement for the real property improvement to be in  such  form  as

 improvement for the amount advanced or so much thereof as remains unpaid
 together with the interest thereon. Upon payment of all sums advanced by
 the municipality and interest thereon,  and  upon  demand  of  the  then
 record  owner  of  the real property, the agency shall deliver a copy of
 the financing statement with an endorsement thereon  that  the  lien  is

 gage  shall  contain such terms and provisions not inconsistent with the
 provisions of this article as the agency shall deem necessary or desira-
 ble to secure repayment of the loan.

 which  such  dwelling is situated is a blighted, deteriorated or deteri-
 orating area or has a blighting influence on the surrounding area, or is
 in danger of becoming a slum or a blighted area because of the existence

 OWNER OF SUCH PRIVATE OR MULTIPLE DWELLING IS A PERSON OR FAMILY OF  LOW

 tors  in accordance with a formula established or approved by the compa-
 ny,  which  agrees  to  provide  housing  accommodations exclusively for
 persons and families of low income, at least thirty percent of whom  are
 referred  to  it by a municipality and have prior to their initial occu-
 pancy in such accommodations resided  in  emergency  shelter  facilities
 operated  by  or  on  behalf of the municipality or who are otherwise in
 need of emergency shelter as determined by the municipality,  providing,
 however,  that  in  the  case  of a building acquired by such a company,
 subsidiary, partnership, or developer the obligation to provide  housing
 accommodations  for  such  persons  shall be applicable only to dwelling
 accommodations which are or become vacant after the date of acquisition.
 Such loans may be made for such period of  time  and  pursuant  to  such
 terms  and conditions as may be required by the municipality, INCLUDING,
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDING THAT THE LIEN CREATED

 APPROVED BY A SUPERVISING AGENCY, MAY BE RECORDED IN AN EQUAL OR  SUBOR-
 DINATE  POSITION,  OR  SUBSEQUENTLY MADE EQUAL OR SUBORDINATE, TO A LIEN
 RECORDED BY ANY PRIVATE LENDER AGAINST THE DWELLING AIDED  BY  THE  LOAN

 cipality may provide that the amount of  the  note  and  mortgage  shall
 automatically  be reduced to zero in five equal decrements commencing on
 the tenth year after the initial occupancy date, provided  that,  as  of
 the  date  of such reduction, such accommodations have been and continue
 to be owned and operated in a manner consistent with an  agreement  with
 the  municipality contained in such note and mortgage to provide housing
 for such persons.  Notwithstanding such provision as  contained  in  the

 or simultaneously with delivery of such note and mortgage, the supervis-
 ing agency made a written determination that  such  reduction  would  be
 necessary to ensure the continued affordability or economic viability of
 such  housing  project.  Such  written  determination shall document the
 basis upon which the loan was determined to be eligible for evaporation.

  § 29. Section 800 of the private housing finance law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 456 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as follows:
  § 800. Policy and purposes of article. It is hereby declared and found
 that there exists in municipalities in this state substandard and insan-
 itary areas and neighborhoods characterized by undermaintained and dete-
 riorating  housing  accommodations  and  under-utilized  non-residential
 buildings and under-utilized vacant land. It is further found that there
 exists in such municipalities a  diminishing  and  seriously  inadequate
 supply  of  safe  and sanitary dwelling accommodations, particularly for
 A. 6655--A  20
 
 persons of low income; that the loss of housing accommodations is caused
 by the inability of the ordinary unaided operations  of  private  enter-
 prise  to  make loans for rehabilitation or construction purposes or for
 conversion  which  accelerates the process of deterioration and abandon-
 ment, turning active and viable neighborhoods into  slums  and  blighted
 areas;  and  that the prevention of deterioration and loss through aban-
 donment can only be achieved by the elimination of conditions which  are
 unsafe  or detrimental to health, the replacement of antiquated heating,
 plumbing, and electrical systems and, where necessary, the overall reha-
 bilitation of certain housing accommodations, the  construction  of  new
 housing  accommodations  on vacant land and the conversion of under-uti-
 lized non-residential property to residential use, and that the unavail-
 ability of funds for the conversion of under-utilized property to  resi-
 dential  use,  for  the  preservation  and  rehabilitation  of  housing
 accommodations and for the construction of new housing accommodations on
 vacant land constitutes a threat to the health, safety and well-being of
 the persons who occupy them and denies  to  others  the  possibility  of
 living in safe and sanitary housing accommodations.
  In  order to promote the preservation and rehabilitation of such hous-
 ing accommodations, the creation of new housing  accommodations  by  the
 conversion  of  under-utilized  non-residential  property  into multiple
 dwellings and the construction of new housing accommodations  on  vacant
 land in such areas and to encourage the investment of private capital in
 such  areas,  provision  should  be  made  for a municipality to attract
 private investment for such  purposes  by  utilizing  funds,  which  are
 available  from the federal government through specific or discretionary
 grants, or are available from other financing sources, for joint partic-
 ipation loans with private investors, OR LOANS OR GRANTS BY THE  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  to  effect the required construction, rehabilitation or conver-
 sion.
  The necessity in the public interest for  the  provisions  hereinafter
 enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
  § 30. Subdivision 5 of section 801 of the private housing finance law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  456 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as

 entity, including a non-profit company, a mutual company, or  a  housing
 development  fund company, which holds record OR BENEFICIAL title in fee
 simple to the existing multiple dwelling  to  be  rehabilitated  or  the
 non-residential  property  to  be converted into a multiple dwelling and
 the real property upon which it is situate or to vacant land upon  which
 the  new multiple dwelling is to be constructed, OR IS THE LESSEE OF ANY
 SUCH REAL PROPERTY HAVING AN UNEXPIRED TERM OF AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS.
  § 31. Section 801 of the private housing finance  law  is  amended  by

 SHALL  MEAN  ANY  LOAN OR GRANT MADE BY THE MUNICIPALITY OR THE NEW YORK
 CITY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PURSUANT  TO  THIS  ARTICLE  EITHER
 WITH  OR  WITHOUT A PRIVATE INVESTOR, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT PROVISIONS
 OF THIS ARTICLE CONCERNING THE REPAYMENT OR FORGIVENESS OF, OR  SECURITY
 FOR, A LOAN SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY GRANT MADE PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE.
  § 32. Subdivision 6 of section 801 of the private housing finance law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  456 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as

  (B) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY GENERAL,  SPECIAL  OR  LOCAL
 LAW,  AND  IN  ADDITION TO THE POWER TO MAKE OR CONTRACT TO MAKE PARTIC-
 IPATION LOANS GRANTED BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  ACTING THROUGH ITS AGENCY, AND THE NEW YORK CITY HOUSING DEVEL-

 that each such loan shall be made upon such terms and conditions as  may
 be approved by the agency, including but not limited to, provisions that

 participation  in  the loan by one or more private investors, [(ii)] (B)

 as  to  lien  nor  be equal as to interest rate, time or rate of amorti-
 zation of principal or time of payment of interest, or otherwise, [(iv)]
 (D) the bond or note and mortgage may provide  that  the  municipality's
 portion  of  a  participation  loan made to an owner shall be reduced to
 zero commencing in the fifteenth year after the execution of the bond or
 note and mortgage, provided that, as of the date of any such  reduction,
 such  multiple  dwelling has been and continues to be owned and operated
 in a manner consistent with a  regulatory  agreement  with  the  munici-
 pality.  Notwithstanding such provision as contained in the bond or note
 and mortgage, the municipality's portion of the loan shall be reduced to
 zero only if, prior to or simultaneously with delivery of such  bond  or
 note  and  mortgage,  the  agency made a written determination that such
 reduction would be necessary to ensure the  continued  affordability  or
 economic  viability of the multiple dwelling. Such written determination

 liens and encumbrances, shall not exceed, except in the case of  a  loan

 fund company, ninety per centum of value unless the agency makes a writ-
 ten  determination  that the owner has insufficient resources to pay for
 the remaining ten per centum of value, in which case such loan shall not
 exceed ninety-five per centum of value. The amount  of  any  such  loan,
 together  with the amount of all prior liens and encumbrances, made to a
 A. 6655--A  23

 non-profit company, a mutual company,  or  a  housing  development  fund
 company  shall  not exceed value, provided that when after completion of
 such rehabilitation, conversion or construction, such multiple  dwelling
 is,  or  is  to  be operated, exclusively for the benefit of persons and
 families who are entitled to occupancy by reason of ownership  of  stock
 in  the  corporate  owners,  such loan shall not exceed ninety-eight per
 centum of value unless the agency makes a written determination that the
 owner has insufficient resources to pay for the remaining two per centum
 of value, in which case such loan shall not exceed value.]

 mortgage  or bonds or notes and mortgages and any contract in connection
 with such permanent and temporary loans may contain such other terms and
 provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this article  as  the

 accommodations or cooperative or condominium units, the  agency's  share
 of the loan may be converted after completion of construction into mort-
 gages  on such dwelling accommodations or condominium units or financing
 statements filed with respect to such cooperative shares, provided  such
 units  or such cooperative shares are purchased by persons of [eligible]
 LOW income. Such mortgages AND ANY  BLANKET  MORTGAGE  THAT  THE  AGENCY
 RETAINS  ON  ANY  PORTION  OF,  OR  ON  ALL OF, THE ELIGIBLE PROJECT may

 matically be reduced to zero over a period of continuous [owner-occupan-
 cy  of  the  housing accommodations assisted by such loan] COMPLIANCE BY
 THE MORTGAGOR WITH A REGULATORY AGREEMENT OR RESTRICTIVE  COVENANT  WITH
 OR  APPROVED  BY  THE AGENCY AND UPON THE SATISFACTION OF ANY ADDITIONAL
 CONDITIONS  SPECIFIED  THEREIN.  Notwithstanding  such  provision  as
 contained  in  such mortgage, the loan shall be reduced to zero only if,
 prior to or simultaneously with delivery of such  mortgage,  the  agency
 made  a  written determination that such reduction would be necessary to
 ensure the continued affordability or economic viability of the eligible
 project. Such written determination shall document the basis upon  which
 the  loan  was determined to be eligible for evaporation. Such period of
 continuous [owner-occupancy] COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH  REGULATORY  AGREEMENT
 OR RESTRICTIVE COVENANT shall not be less than fifteen years.
  [5.]  4.  If  the  eligible  project is to consist of one to four unit
 dwelling accommodations or cooperative or condominium units, the  agency
 shall  require  that  the  dwelling  units  be offered only to bona fide
 purchasers who intend to occupy a unit as their principal place of resi-
 dence; provided, however, that in the case of two to four unit  dwelling
 accommodations  the bona fide purchaser may occupy only a single unit as
 a principal place of residence. If the purchaser ceases  to  occupy  the
 unit  as  a  principal  place  of  residence, the agency may provide for
 recapture of all or a portion of the agency's share of the loan.
  [6.] 5. If the eligible project is  a  rental  project,  the  agency's
 share of the loan may be converted after completion of construction into
 a [non-interest bearing, non-amortizing thirty year loan] PERMANENT LOAN
 WITH A TERM OF FORTY YEARS, PROVIDED THAT SUCH PERIOD MAY BE EXTENDED AS
 THE  AGENCY  MAY DETERMINE IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED AFFORDA-
 BILITY OR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE ELIGIBLE PROJECT,  payable  [at  the
 end  of  its  term, provided that such loan shall be also payable out of
 profits upon any sale or refinancing of the project prior to the end  of
 such  thirty  year period] IN SUCH MANNER AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE NOTE
 AND ANY MORTGAGE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOAN. SUCH  NOTE  AND  MORTGAGE
 MAY  CONTAIN  SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE AGENCY MAY DEEM NECESSARY
 OR DESIRABLE TO EFFECTUATE THE PURPOSES AND PROVISIONS OF THIS  ARTICLE.
 The  sponsor  or  any subsequent owner or owners of such a project shall
 agree to rent such units only to persons of [eligible]  LOW  income  for
 such  [thirty  year] period [and shall agree that all] AS THE AGENCY MAY
 DETERMINE. ALL SUCH units shall  be  subject  to  THE  EMERGENCY  TENANT
 PROTECTION  ACT  OF NINETEEN SEVENTY-FOUR AND the rent stabilization law
 of nineteen hundred sixty-nine, as amended [for a period of thirty years
 after initial occupancy], unless converted to a cooperative or condomin-
 ium pursuant to subdivision [eight] SEVEN of this section. [At  the  end
 of such period each unit shall continue to be subject to such law there-
 after  until  the  first  vacancy occurs at which time the unit shall be
 decontrolled.] Initial rentals for all rental units shall be set by  the
 agency.
  [7.]  6.  If  the  eligible project is a rental project annual profits
 shall be limited to an amount set by the agency for as long as the  loan
 is  outstanding.  Excess  profits  shall  be  used  to establish project
 reserves, provide capital improvements or reduce the principal amount of
 the agency's loan, as determined by the agency.
  [8.] 7. If the eligible project is a rental project, no conversion  to
 a  cooperative  or condominium shall be permitted for a period of twenty
 years after initial occupancy, and unless (i) the agency's share of  the
 loan  is prepaid upon such conversion, (ii) the conversion shall be done
 pursuant to section three hundred fifty-two-eeee of the general business
 A. 6655--A  26
 
 law as a non-eviction plan, and (iii) apartments  occupied  by  non-pur-
 chasing  tenants continue to be subject to the rent stabilization law of
 nineteen hundred sixty-nine as amended, until the occurrence of a vacan-
 cy.
  [9.]  8. A loan made pursuant to this article shall be exempt from the
 mortgage recording taxes imposed by article eleven of the tax law.
  [10.] 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of  any  general,  special  or
 local  law  or  charter, the agency shall have power, without soliciting
 competing bids, to contract with any sponsor or to make provision  in  a
 loan  for  the  construction  or reconstruction of any site improvements
 located in the public right-of-way OR ON THE  ELIGIBLE  SITE  which  are
 necessary for the development of an eligible project. Such site improve-
 ments  may  include,  but  shall  not be limited to, streets, sidewalks,
 LANDSCAPING, PARKS AND OPEN SPACE, SOCIAL,  RECREATIONAL,  COMMUNAL  AND
 OTHER  NON-RESIDENTIAL  FACILITIES  AND THE OUTFITTING THEREOF, lighting
 fixtures, and water and sewer lines, INCIDENTAL OR  APPURTENANT  TO  THE
 CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH ELIGIBLE PROJECTS.
  [11.]  10.  No  loan  shall be made pursuant to the provisions of this
 article unless the agency finds that: (a) the construction of the eligi-
 ble project does not directly displace current low and  moderate  income
 residents  of  the  eligible  site;  (b)  the eligible project leverages
 private and other public investment, if any, so as to reduce the  amount
 of  assistance  provided  pursuant to this article to the minimal amount
 which is necessary for construction of the  eligible  project;  (c)  the
 eligible  project  will  be built by a private developer/builder who has
 agreed to limit its profit in accordance with a formula satisfactory  to
 the  agency; (d) the eligible project will provide assistance to an area
 which is blighted or deteriorated or has a blighting  influence  on  the
 surrounding  area, or is in danger of becoming a slum or a blighted area
 because of neighborhood conditions indicating an inability or unwilling-
 ness of the private sector to cause the type of construction for which a
 loan is to be provided; and (e) the  eligible  project  will  make  home
 ownership  or  rental housing affordable to persons who cannot presently
 afford the housing available based upon the ordinary  unaided  operation
 of private enterprise.
  [12.]  11.  a.  The  agency  may make non-interest bearing advances to
 sponsors to defray the pre-development costs  of  eligible  projects  in
 accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
  b.  No  such  advances shall be made unless the agency finds that: (i)
 the sponsor proposes to finance the eligible project in whole or in part
 by a loan granted pursuant to this  article  or  that  the  project,  if
 otherwise  financed, will provide housing for persons or families of low
 income, and that such project is otherwise consistent with the  purposes
 of  this article; (ii) the project site is suitable, there is a need for
 the housing type proposed in the area to be served and  the  project  is
 feasible;  and  (iii) it is reasonable to anticipate that financing will
 be obtained and the agency makes a finding to that effect.
  c. No such advances may be made  to  a  sponsor  unless  such  sponsor
 enters  into an agreement with the agency which provides that such spon-
 sor shall be regulated with respect to  rents,  profits,  dividends  and
 disposition  of  its  property  or  franchise,  in  accordance  with the
 provisions of this article.
  d. An advance granted pursuant to this section shall be used  only  to
 defray  the  pre-development costs of eligible projects. For purposes of
 this subdivision, the term  pre-development  costs  shall  include,  but
 shall  not  be  limited to: the reasonable and necessary costs for plan-
 A. 6655--A  27

 ning, site preparation, developing architectural drawings and conducting
 engineering and environmental studies, but shall not include acquisition
 of  land  or  buildings,  drainage  and  landscaping  of  vacant  land,
 construction of new buildings or the reconstruction or rehabilitation of
 existing buildings.
  e.  Each  such  advance  shall  be repaid in full to the agency by the
 sponsor. Such repayment shall be made upon receipt by the sponsor or its
 successor in interest of the proceeds of its  mortgage  or  construction
 loan  for the eligible project, unless the agency extends the period for
 the repayment of such advances. In no event shall the time of  repayment
 be  extended  to  a  date  later than the date of final advance of funds
 pursuant to such mortgage or  construction  loan.  Notwithstanding  this
 paragraph,  the  agency may reduce such advance to zero over a period of
 continued compliance with the agency's agreement with the sponsor pursu-
 ant to paragraph c of this subdivision if the agency has made a  written
 determination  that  such  reduction  would  be  necessary to ensure the
 continued affordability or economic viability of the  eligible  project.
 Such written determination shall document the basis upon which the agen-
 cy's  non-interest  bearing  advance  was determined eligible for evapo-
 ration.
  f. If the agency, in its discretion, determines at any time that mort-
 gage or construction financing for  the  eligible  project  may  not  be
 obtained,  then all advances made to the sponsor pursuant to this subdi-
 vision shall become immediately due and payable upon the demand  of  the
 agency.
  [13.]  12.  If  the  eligible project is a rental project, the bond or
 note and mortgage or bonds or notes or mortgages issued by  the  sponsor
 of  any eligible project to secure a participation loan may provide that
 the city's portion of such loan shall be reduced to zero  commencing  on
 the fifteenth year after the execution of such bond or note and mortgage
 or  bonds  or  notes  or mortgages, provided that, as of the date of any
 such reduction, the eligible project has been and continues to be  owned
 and operated in a manner consistent with a regulatory agreement with the
 city.  Notwithstanding  such  provision as contained in the bond or note
 and mortgage or bonds or notes or mortgages, the loan shall  be  reduced
 to  zero  only if, prior to or simultaneously with delivery of such bond
 or note and mortgage or bonds or notes or mortgages, the agency  made  a
 written  determination  that such reduction would be necessary to ensure
 the continued  affordability  or  economic  viability  of  the  eligible
 project.  Such written determination shall document the basis upon which
 the loan was determined to be eligible for evaporation.
