  COMMENDING  the  Inductees  and  Honorees  of  the
  Jewish Sports Heritage Association,  Inc.  on  April
  23, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge and
celebrate  individuals  and organizations of cultural significance which
add  vitality,  sensitivity,  understanding  and  inspiration  to  the
diversity and value of the people of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Inductees  and  Honorees  of  the  Jewish  Sports Heritage
Association, Inc. to be celebrated at its 5th Annual Induction  Ceremony
on  Sunday,  April  23, 2023, at Temple Israel of Lawrence, in Lawrence,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Jewish  Sports  Heritage  Association  chronicles  and
celebrates  Jewish involvement in all sports; from boxing to football to
tennis, from basketball to baseball to swimming, from the  broadcaster's
booth  to  the  sportswriters  desk,  and  from the playing field to the
manager's bench and the owner's office, Jews  have  made  a  significant
impact on the world of sports; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Moreover,  in  focusing  on  sports,  an  aspect of Jewish
accomplishments with which too many are unfamiliar,  the  Jewish  Sports
Heritage  Association  offers  a  starting  point  for  discussions  of
stereotype and prejudice; and
 
  WHEREAS, In demonstrating the fallacy of the assumption  that  "Jews
in  Sports"  is considered by Jews and non-Jews alike to be an oxymoron,
the Jewish Sports Heritage Association questions  the  many  stereotypes
about diverse groups which we carry in our minds and hearts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sports have provided a means of weaving not only Jews, but
other minority and immigrant groups, into  the  American  tapestry;  the
story  of  Jews  in  Sports  is  a  paradigmatic  piece of the mosaic of
America; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's Jewish Sports  Heritage  Association  Inductees
include:  Jerry  Eskenazi,  Author  and  Sportswriter;  Sherry  Levin,
Basketball Player and Coach; Nancy Feldman, Soccer Coach; David Newmark,
Basketball Player; Dr.  Ludwig  Guttmann,  Paralympics;  Mike  Saunders,
Athletic  Trainer;  Mike  Katz,  Bodybuilding; Herb Turetzky, Basketball
Scorer; and Abel Kiviat, Track and Field; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, this year's  distinguished  Honorees  include:
Mike  Oren,  Soccer  Coach,  The Dr.  Bruno Lambert Jewish Good Guys in
Sports Award; Riley Weiss, Hewlett High School Basketball,  The  Michael
Freedman  Outstanding Jewish High School Athletes of the Year Award; Max
Klein, Newton North High School, The Michael Freedman Outstanding Jewish
High School Athletes of the Year Award;  Skyler  Schork,  United  States
Naval  Academy  Rowing,  The  Jay  Fiedler  Outstanding  Jewish  College
Athletes of the Year Award; Ryan Turell, Yeshiva University  Basketball,
 
The  Jay  Fiedler Outstanding Jewish College Athletes of the Year Award;
and Elliot Steinmetz, Yeshiva University, Men's Basketball  Head  Coach,
The Marty Riger Outstanding Jewish Coach of the Year Award; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes that New York State is the
home  to  countless  individuals  of  Jewish  descent who are strong and
colorful threads, vital to the fabric of our  rich  heritage,  who  have
contributed,  and  continue  to  add  to  the advancement of our culture
through their traditional and non-traditional  roles  in  society;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the  Inductees  and  Honorees  of  the  Jewish  Sports  Heritage
Association,  Inc. to be celebrated at its 5th Annual Induction Ceremony
on April 23, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
