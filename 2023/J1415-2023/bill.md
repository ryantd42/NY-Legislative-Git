  COMMENDING  Elizabeth Piraino upon the occasion of
  her designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in emergency situations  to  preserve  the
life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Elizabeth  Piraino  upon  the  occasion  of  her designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, A single parent of two children, Elizabeth Piraino  stopped
at  the  local BJ's Wholesale Club to purchase some groceries on her way
home from a full day of work as a registered  nurse;  while  waiting  in
line  in  the self-checkout area of the store, she heard someone calling
for assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Immediately responding to the appeal  for  help,  Elizabeth
Piraino  acted  bravely  in  providing  life-saving  cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) to a gentleman who was collapsing  onto  the  floor;
her  many  years  of  nursing  experience  allowed  her  to  assess  the
gentleman's condition quickly and proceed to take swift action; and
 
  WHEREAS, Performing  CPR  immediately,  Elizabeth  Piraino  implored
someone  to  call 911 and requested the automated external defibrillator
(AED) from a store  employee;  she  began  to  deliver  immediate  chest
compressions,  and  when the AED was given to her, she defibrillated the
gentleman's heart into normal rhythm; and
 
  WHEREAS, After Elizabeth Piraino  saved  the  gentleman's  life  and
stabilized  his condition until the paramedics arrived to assume control
of his care, the ambulance crew transported the patient to  Peconic  Bay
Medical  Center in Riverhead, New York; due to Elizabeth Piraino's noble
and courageous actions, a precious life was saved, and a seemingly  dire
situation had positive results; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Elizabeth  Piraino, in her spontaneous and heroic act, has
so aptly demonstrated her character and compassion for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of her action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Elizabeth  Piraino  upon  the  occasion  of  her designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Elizabeth Piraino.
