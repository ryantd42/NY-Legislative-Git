BY: M. of A. Durso
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 3, 2023, as Skilled Trades Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor skilled
trades professionals and the critical role they play in the  development
of  the State of New York; these talented and hard-working men and women
are an asset beyond remuneration and cannot  be  sufficiently  extolled;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 3, 2023, as Skilled Trades Day  in
the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Skilled Trades Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Skilled Trades Day aims to raise  awareness  about
the  benefit  of  skilled  trades  jobs  in  the  State  of New York and
throughout the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Across the  Nation,  many  businesses  are  facing  a  huge
dilemma,  there  are  more  skilled  trades  job openings than there are
people to fill them; according to Forbes, over 53% of  workers  employed
in  a  skilled trade are nearing retirement age and only 1 in 5 students
graduating from high school have shown an interest in trade jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the last 30 years, parents have encouraged children to
attend colleges or  universities  after  graduating  from  high  school,
neglecting  to  embrace  the  value  found in skilled trades; when these
students graduate from college, they are often faced with crippling debt
and a job market that simply is not hiring; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the  other  hand,  trades  jobs  often  only  require  a
certificate  for employment, meaning that those looking to go into trade
jobs will face little to no debt when they enter the workforce, and they
can  enter  the  workforce  much  sooner  than  their  college  student
counterparts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Skilled trade jobs often offer excellent pay as a means to
meet the demand for these jobs, as well as benefits and healthcare; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Skilled  Trades  Day  was  founded  by  City  Machine
Technologies,  Inc.  which  is  currently  facing a labor shortage since
mechanically inclined workers are becoming harder and  harder  to  find;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sixty-two  percent  of  employers  representing  the trade
industry have reported struggling to find individuals to fill  important
skilled  trade  positions,  raising concerns about the future employment
levels of the trades as a whole; and
 
  WHEREAS, Skilled Trades Day was established  to  inform  individuals
and  raise  awareness  of  the  benefits of being a skilled laborer, and
 
recruit  and  retain  skilled  workers  to  fulfill  the  need  for  the
industry's future workforce requirement; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 3,  2023,  as  Skilled
Trades Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
