  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Building Safety Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's  continuing  efforts  to  address the critical
issues  of  safety,  energy  efficiency,  water  conservation  and
sustainability  in  the  built  environment affect its citizens, both in
everyday life and in times of natural disaster,  and  give  New  Yorkers
confidence that its structures are safe and sound; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Confidence  in  building  safety  is  achieved through the
devotion of vigilant guardians:  building safety  and  fire  prevention
officials,  architects,  engineers, builders, laborers and others in the
construction  industry  who  work  year-round  to  ensure  the  safe
construction of buildings; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated members of the International Code Council develop
and  implement  the  highest-quality  codes  to protect Americans in the
buildings where we live, learn, work, worship, and play; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Codes, the most widely  adopted  building
safety, energy and fire prevention codes in the nation, are used by most
United  States' cities, counties and states; these modern building codes
also include safeguards to protect the  public  from  natural  disasters
such  as  hurricanes,  snowstorms,  tornadoes,  wild  land  fires  and
earth-quakes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Building Safety Month is  sponsored  by  the  International
Code  Council  and  International Code Council Foundation, to remind the
public about the critical role of communities' largely unknown guardians
of public safety--local code officials--who  assure  citizens  of  safe,
efficient and livable buildings; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's theme is "Building Safety Starts With You"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Building  Safety  Month 2023, encourages appropriate steps
everyone can take to ensure the safety of  our  built  environment,  and
recognizes  that  the  implementation of safety codes by local and state
agencies has saved lives and protected homes and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  in  observance  of  Building  Safety  Month,
Americans  are asked to consider projects to improve building safety and
sustainability at home and in the  community,  and  to  acknowledge  the
essential  service  provided  to  all  of us by local and state building
departments and federal agencies in protecting lives and property; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body reaffirms its commitment to fostering
continuing attention to building safety, and encourages all New  Yorkers
to participate in Building Safety Month; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Building
Safety Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
