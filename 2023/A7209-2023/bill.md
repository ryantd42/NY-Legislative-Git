  § 2407. Bond limits. (1) Except for notes issued in  nineteen  hundred

 bonds and notes, the interest on which is  not  included  in  the  gross
 income  of  the  holders  of the bonds and notes under the United States
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any subsequent correspond-
 ing internal revenue law of the United States, in an aggregate principal
 amount exceeding ten billion [two] SEVEN hundred twenty million dollars,
 excluding from such limitation (a) an amount equal to any original issue
 discount from the principal amount of any bonds  or  notes  issued,  (b)
 bonds  and  notes  issued to refund outstanding bonds and notes, and (c)
 bonds and notes not described  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision
 issued  to  refund  outstanding  bonds  and notes in accordance with the
 provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or the Tax Reform Act of
 1986, as amended, where such bonds or notes  are  not  included  in  the
 statewide  volume cap on private purpose bonds under section 146 of such
 code provided, however, that upon any refunding pursuant to  this  para-
 graph  or  paragraph (b) of this subdivision, such exclusion shall apply
 only to the extent that the amount of the refunding bonds or notes  does
 not  exceed  (i)  the outstanding amount of the refunded bonds or notes,
 plus (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable federal tax  law,  costs
 of  issuance  of  the  refunding  bonds or notes to be financed from the
 proceeds of the refunding bonds or notes.  No such bond or note shall be
 issued by the agency on or after July twenty-third, two thousand  [twen-
 ty-three]  TWENTY-FIVE,  excluding  bonds  and  notes  issued  to refund
 outstanding bonds and  notes.  No  more  than  one  billion  dollars  of
 A. 7209  3

 proceeds  of bonds or notes issued by the agency pursuant to this subdi-
 vision shall be used for mortgage purposes by blending with proceeds  of
 bonds issued pursuant to subdivision two of this section.
  (2)  In  connection  with  the  issuance  of  bonds for the purpose of
 furthering programs described in this title, the agency is authorized to
 covenant and consent that the interest on any of  its  bonds,  notes  or
 other  obligations shall be includable, under the United States Internal
 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or any subsequent corresponding  inter-
 nal revenue law of the United States, in the gross income of the holders
 of the bonds to the same extent and in the same manner that the interest
 on  bills,  bonds,  notes  or  other obligations of the United States is
 includable in the gross income of the holders thereof under said  Inter-
 nal  Revenue  Code or any such subsequent law. Pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion, the agency shall not issue bonds, notes or other obligations in an
 aggregate principal amount exceeding one billion  five  hundred  million
 dollars,  excluding  from  such  limitation  bonds, notes or other obli-
 gations issued to refund outstanding bonds, notes or other  obligations.
 No  such bond, note or other obligation shall be issued by the agency on
 or after July twenty-third,  two  thousand  [twenty-three]  TWENTY-FIVE,
 excluding bonds, notes or other obligations issued to refund outstanding
 bonds,  notes  or  other obligations and no mortgages shall be purchased
 with the proceeds of such bonds, notes or other obligations  after  such
 date.  The  board  of  directors  of  the agency shall establish program
 guidelines for purposes of bonds,  notes  or  other  obligations  issued
 pursuant  to  this  subdivision.  The board of directors shall establish
 from time to time maximum income limits of persons eligible  to  receive
 mortgages  financed by bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant
 to this subdivision, which income limits with respect  to  one-third  of
 the  total  principal  amount  of mortgages authorized to be so financed
 shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent of the  latest  maximum
 income  limits  permitted  under  the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
 amended, for mortgagors financed by mortgage revenue bonds, with respect
 to one-third of such principal amount  authorized  to  be  so  financed,
 shall  not exceed one hundred thirty-five percent of such income limits,
 and with respect to one-third of such principal amount authorized to  be
 so  financed, shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent of such limits,
 provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum  income  limits
 of  persons  eligible  to receive mortgages financed by the agency under
 its neighborhood revitalization  program  (and  any  successor  program)
 shall  not exceed one hundred fifty percent of the latest maximum income
 limits permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of  1986,  as  amended,
 for mortgagors financed by mortgage revenue bonds.
  (3)  The fixing of the statutory maximums in this section shall not be
 construed as constituting a contract between the agency and the  holders
 of  its bonds or notes that additional bonds and notes may not be issued
 subsequently by the agency in the event  that  such  statutory  maximums
 shall subsequently be increased by law.
  § 5. Section 19 of chapter 555 of the laws of 1989 amending the public
