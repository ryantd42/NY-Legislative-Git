 AN  ACT  to amend the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seven-
  ty-four, in relation to housing accommodations  in  certain  buildings
  where  seventy-five  percent  of the total residents are fifty-five or
  older
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 5 of section 4 of chapter 576 of the laws of 1974,
 constituting the emergency tenant protection act  of  nineteen  seventy-
 four, is amended by adding a new subdivision c to read as follows:
  C.  THE  EXCEPTION  IN PARAGRAPH FIVE OF SUBDIVISION A OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS IN BUILDINGS CONTAINING SIX OR
 MORE DWELLING UNITS IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS AGED FIFTY-FIVE  OR
 OLDER EXCEEDS SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUILDING RESIDENTS.
  §  2.  Subdivision  a of section 10 of section 4 of chapter 576 of the
 laws of 1974, constituting the emergency tenant protection act of  nine-
 teen  seventy-four,  as amended by section 15 of part Q of chapter 39 of
 the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  a. For cities having a population of less than one million  and  towns
 and  villages, the state division of housing and community renewal shall
 be empowered to implement this  act  by  appropriate  regulations.  Such
 regulations  may encompass such speculative or manipulative practices or
 renting or leasing practices as the state division of housing and commu-
 nity renewal determines constitute or are likely to cause  circumvention
 of  this act. Such regulations shall prohibit practices which are likely
 to prevent any person from asserting any right or remedy granted by this
 act, including but not limited to retaliatory  termination  of  periodic
 tenancies and shall require owners to grant a new one or two year vacan-
 cy or renewal lease at the option of the tenant, except where a mortgage

 or  mortgage  commitment existing as of the local effective date of this
 act provides that the owner shall not grant a one-year lease; and  shall
 prescribe  standards with respect to the terms and conditions of new and
 renewal  leases,  additional  rent  and such related matters as security
 deposits, advance rental payments, the use of escalator clauses in leas-
 es and provision for increase in rentals for garages and other ancillary
 facilities, so as to ensure that the level of rent  adjustments  author-
 ized  under  this  law  will not be subverted and made ineffective. SUCH
 REGULATIONS SHALL REQUIRE OWNERS OF BUILDINGS  CONTAINING  SIX  OR  MORE
 DWELLING UNITS IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS AGED FIFTY-FIVE OR OLDER
 EXCEEDS  SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUILDING RESIDENTS TO OFFER A
 VACANCY OR RENEWAL LEASE OF NO FEWER THAN TWO YEARS.  Any  provision  of
 the  regulations  permitting  an  owner  to  refuse  to renew a lease on
 grounds that the owner seeks to recover possession of a housing accommo-
 dation for his or her own use and occupancy or for the use and occupancy
 of his or her immediate family shall permit recovery of only one housing
 accommodation, shall require that an  owner  demonstrate  immediate  and
 compelling  need and that the housing accommodation will be the proposed
 occupants' primary residence and shall not apply where a member  of  the
 housing  accommodation  is  sixty-two  years of age or older, has been a
 tenant in a housing accommodation in that building for fifteen years  or
 more,  or has an impairment which results from anatomical, physiological
 or psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol,  gambling,
 or any controlled substance, which are demonstrable by medically accept-
 able  clinical  and  laboratory  diagnostic  techniques,  and  which are
 expected to be permanent and which prevent the tenant from  engaging  in
 any  substantial  gainful  employment;  provided, however, that a tenant
 required to surrender a housing  accommodation  under  this  subdivision
 shall  have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for
 damages, declaratory,  and  injunctive  relief  against  a  landlord  or
 purchaser  of  the premises who makes a fraudulent statement regarding a
 proposed use of the housing accommodation. In any action  or  proceeding
 brought  pursuant to this subdivision a prevailing tenant shall be enti-
 tled to recovery of actual damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
