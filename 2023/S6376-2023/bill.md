  Committee on Finance
 
 AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to creating the New York
  autism spectrum disorders treatment, training and research council and
  providing for the powers and duties of the council
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Intent.  The  legislature  hereby finds and declares that
 autism spectrum disorders, hereinafter ASDs, currently  affect  approxi-
 mately  one  in  110 children and are considered to be an "urgent public
 health concern" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  The legislature further finds that New York state  has  not  responded
 sufficiently  to  this  crisis.  In  its 2010 report, the New York state
 Interagency Task Force on Autism,  hereinafter  Task  Force,  identified
 five  primary  needs  of  the  growing  population  of New York citizens
 affected by ASDs: coordination of state services, early  identification,
 lifelong  service  delivery, increased dissemination of information, and
 coordination of research efforts. First, as a collaborative effort of 11
 independent state agencies that each serve individuals impacted by ASDs,
 the Task Force itself exemplifies the need for coordination of research,
 treatment and training responsibilities. Second, while  the  Task  Force
 determined  that  early  identification and intervention were crucial to
 minimizing the symptoms and impact of ASDs, it reported that only  eight
 percent  of pediatricians routinely screen for ASDs and approximately 30
 percent of children with ASDs do  not  receive  the  early  intervention
 services  provided  by  the  New York State Department of Health. Third,
 recognizing that the thousands of children diagnosed with ASDs will soon
 age out of the state's educational system, the Task Force noted a dearth
 of post-secondary training and transitional services. Fourth,  the  Task
 Force  determined  that  individuals and families affected by ASDs would

 benefit from a centralized clearinghouse of  relevant  information,  and
 called  for  the  provision of user-friendly access to such information.
 Finally, the Task Force reported that  collaboratively  determining  the
 direction of future ASD research would best utilize available public and
 private funding.
  The  legislature  therefore  declares  that  there is a need to expand
 treatment, training and research with regard to ASDs  --  including  the
 enhancement of efforts to improve access to, and the efficacy of, needed
 services, support and treatment.
