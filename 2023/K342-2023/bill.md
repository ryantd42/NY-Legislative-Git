  HONORING  Chief  Walter  P.  Schmitt  Jr. upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years  of  dedicated  service to the West
  Oneonta Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Chief Walter
P.  Schmitt  Jr.  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service  to  the  West  Oneonta
Volunteer  Fire  Department to be celebrated Sunday, May 7, 2023, at the
Oneonta Town Hall; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Walter  P.  Schmitt  Jr.  joined  the  West  Oneonta  Fire
Department  in  February of 1973; throughout his 50 years of service, he
held several positions within the  Department  including  2nd  Assistant
Chief,  1st  Assistant Chief, and currently, Chief of the Department; he
became Chief in 1989, and has held that position since; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1987, Walter P. Schmitt  Jr.,  on  behalf  of  the  West
Oneonta  Fire  Department,  successfully  advocated for, and obtained, a
grant from Marcy-South Powerline for a 4x4 pickup truck to be used as  a
utility  and  brush truck for the Department; in the years since, Walter
P. Schmitt Jr.  helped secure several grants from  various  sources  for
new  and  added  equipment,  as  well  as  replacement  vehicles for the
original fleet; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chief Walter P. Schmitt Jr. has been  extremely  active  in
supporting  the NYS Association of Fire Chiefs yearly hands-on training,
and has also scheduled several FASNY  training  sessions  for  the  West
Oneonta Fire Department and surrounding departments; furthermore, he has
supported  the NYS Fire Academy at Montour Falls, supplying equipment to
run pump and water supply refreshers for training officers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Most  recently,  Chief  Walter  P.  Schmitt  Jr.  has  been
instrumental  in  helping to secure a new replacement engine for both of
the Department's attack engines; the new truck  was  granted  under  the
Chief's able leadership in a vote on April 18, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Chief Walter P. Schmitt Jr. is one such firefighter; throughout 50 years
of  devoted  service,  this  volunteer  heroically  performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Walter  P.  Schmitt  Jr. upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 50 years of  dedicated  service  to  the  West
Oneonta Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Chief Walter P. Schmitt Jr.
