 state.  Each  member  of  such  committee  shall  serve  until [his] THE
 MEMBER'S death, resignation or the appointment  of  [his]  THE  MEMBER'S
 successor.  A  lawyer who has been or who shall be appointed a member of
 the committee for one district may be appointed a member of the  commit-
 tee for another district within the same department.

 before  which  the application is pending and only upon [his] THE CHAIR-
 PERSON OR ACTING CHAIRPERSON'S written certification either:
  1.  that  the applicant, since [he] THEY applied to take the bar exam-
 ination or to dispense with such examination or since [he] THEY  applied
 on  motion  to  be  admitted to practice, has changed [his] THEIR actual
 residence to such other judicial district in the same or  other  depart-
 ment, or, if not a resident of the state, has acquired full-time employ-
 ment  in  or  changed  [his] THEIR place of full-time employment to such

  Rule 9404. Certificate of character and  fitness.  Unless  otherwise
 ordered  by the appellate division, no person shall be admitted to prac-
 tice without a certificate from the proper committee that it  has  care-
 fully  investigated the character and fitness of the applicant and that,
 in such respects, [he] THE APPLICANT is entitled to admission. To enable
 the committee to make such investigation, the justices of the  appellate
 division  are  authorized  to prescribe and from time to time to amend a
 form of statement or questionnaire to be  submitted  by  the  applicant,
 including specifically [his] THE APPLICANT'S present and such past plac-
 es  of  actual  residence as may be required therein, listing the street
 and number, if any, and the period of time [he] THE APPLICANT resided at
 each place. SUCH QUESTIONNAIRE SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY QUESTIONS REQUIRING
 THE DISCLOSURE OF  THE  APPLICANT'S  HISTORY  OF  INTERACTION  WITH  LAW
 ENFORCEMENT OR THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IF SUCH INTERACTION (I) IS NO
 LONGER  PENDING  AND  DID NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION, (II) RESULTED IN A
 JUVENILE PROCEEDING OR YOUTHFUL OFFENDER ADJUDICATION, OR (III) RESULTED
 IN A CONVICTION WHICH IS NOW SEALED.
  § 4. Rule 9405 of the civil practice law and rules is amended to  read
 as follows:
  Rule  9405.  Prior  application.  In the event that any applicant has
 made a prior application for admission to practice in this state  or  in
 any  other jurisdiction, then upon said statement or questionnaire or in
 an accompanying signed statement, [he] THE APPLICANT shall set forth  in
 detail  all  the  facts  with  respect to such prior application and its
 disposition. If such prior application had been filed in  any  appellate
 division  of  this state and if the applicant failed to obtain a certif-
 icate of good character  and  fitness  from  the  appropriate  character
 committee or if for any reason such prior application was disapproved or
 rejected  either  by said committee or said appellate division, [he] THE
 APPLICANT shall obtain and submit the written consent of said  appellate
 division  to  the  renewal  of [his] THEIR application in that appellate
 division or in any other appellate division.
  § 5. Rule 9406 of the civil practice law  and  rules,  as  amended  by
 chapter 226 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  Rule  9406. Proof.  No person shall receive said certificate from any
 committee and no person shall be admitted to practice as an attorney and
 counselor at law in the courts of this state,  unless  [he]  THEY  shall

 States and of the state of New York; and
  2. that [he has] THEY HAVE complied with all the requirements  of  the
