 Introduced  by  Sen.  BAILEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the executive law and the  criminal  procedure  law,  in
  relation to establishing the office of special investigation
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The executive law is amended by adding a new  section  70-d
 to read as follows:
  §  70-D.  OFFICE  OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION.  1. THERE SHALL BE ESTAB-
 LISHED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW AN OFFICE OF  SPECIAL  INVESTIGATION
 WHICH  SHALL  HAVE  THE  POWER  TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE ANY ALLEGED
 CRIMINAL OFFENSE OR OFFENSES COMMITTED BY A POLICE OFFICER AS DEFINED IN
 SUBDIVISION THIRTY-FOUR OF SECTION 1.20 OF THE CRIMINAL  PROCEDURE  LAW,
 OR  A  PEACE  OFFICER  AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION THIRTY-THREE OF SECTION
 1.20 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, CONCERNING THE DEATH OF  ANY  PERSON
 THAT  RESULTED  FROM OR POTENTIALLY RESULTED FROM INJURIES THAT OCCURRED
 OR MAY HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY ENCOUNTER WITH SUCH POLICE OFFI-
 CER OR PEACE OFFICER. THE OFFICE SHALL CONDUCT SUCH AN INVESTIGATION AND
 MAY CONDUCT SUCH A PROSECUTION UPON ITS WRITTEN  FINDING  THAT  SUCH  IS
 APPROPRIATE  BECAUSE:  (A)  THERE IS A LACK OF ALTERNATIVE PROSECUTORIAL
 RESOURCES TO ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE SUCH CRIMINAL  OFFENSE
 OR  OFFENSES;  (B)  SUCH  INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION CANNOT BE EFFEC-
 TIVELY CONDUCTED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY  OF  THE  COUNTY  WHEREIN  THE
 OFFENSE  OR A PORTION THEREOF IS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED; (C) THE
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS FAILED OR  REFUSED  TO  EFFECTIVELY  CONDUCT  SUCH
 INVESTIGATION  AND PROSECUTION; OR (D) THE EXERCISE OF SUCH JURISDICTION
 IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENCE OF  THE  PUBLIC  IN  THE  CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE  SYSTEM AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION
 WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW SHALL BE  HEADED  BY  THE  DEPUTY  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL  APPOINTED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE
 OF THIS SECTION.

 SHE MAY DESIGNATE BEFORE ANY COURT OR GRAND JURY IN THE STATE AND  EXER-
 CISE  ALL  OF  THE  POWERS AND PERFORM ALL OF THE DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO
 SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WOULD  OTHERWISE
 BE AUTHORIZED OR REQUIRED TO EXERCISE OR PERFORM.
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 SHALL, WITHOUT CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION, APPOINT AND EMPLOY, FIX HIS OR
 HER COMPENSATION, AND AT HIS OR HER PLEASURE REMOVE, A  DEPUTY  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL  IN  CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION. THE ATTORNEY

 AND AT PLEASURE REMOVE, SUCH ASSISTANT DEPUTIES, INVESTIGATORS AND OTHER
 PERSONS  AS  HE  OR  SHE DEEMS NECESSARY, DETERMINE THEIR DUTIES AND FIX
 THEIR COMPENSATION.
  4. (A) WHERE AN INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED  IN

 IN  THE COUNTY IN WHICH SUCH ACTS ALLEGEDLY OCCURRED FOR THE APPOINTMENT
 OF A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE  AND  POTENTIALLY
 PROSECUTE  SUCH MATTER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY OTHER LAW,
 SUCH COURT SHALL THEREUPON APPOINT A QUALIFIED ATTORNEY AT LAW HAVING AN
 OFFICE IN OR RESIDING  IN  SUCH  COUNTY  OR  AN  ADJOINING  COUNTY,  NOT
 EMPLOYED  AS  A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, TO ACT
 AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MATTER,  AT
 A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE HOURLY RATE TO BE SET BY SUCH COURT.
  (B)  THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY THE STATE COMPTROLLER
 AND THE COURT WHEN SUCH APPOINTMENT HAS BEEN MADE AND ACCEPTED  BY  SUCH
 ATTORNEY.  REASONABLE  FEES  FOR ATTORNEYS AND INVESTIGATION AND LITI-
 GATION EXPENSES SHALL BE PAID BY THE STATE TO SUCH PRIVATE COUNSEL  FROM
 TIME  TO  TIME  DURING  THE PENDENCY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND ANY PROSE-
 CUTION AND APPEAL, UPON THE AUDIT AND WARRANT OF  THE  COMPTROLLER.  ANY
 DISPUTE  WITH  RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT OF SUCH FEES AND EXPENSES SHALL BE
 RESOLVED BY THE COURT UPON MOTION OR BY WAY OF A SPECIAL PROCEEDING.
  (C) THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL APPOINTED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION
 MAY APPEAR IN PERSON OR BY ANY SPECIAL ASSISTANT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 HE OR SHE MAY DESIGNATE BEFORE ANY COURT OR GRAND JURY IN THE STATE  AND
 EXERCISE ALL OF THE POWERS AND PERFORM ALL OF THE DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO
 SUCH  ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WOULD OTHERWISE
 BE AUTHORIZED OR REQUIRED TO EXERCISE OR PERFORM.
  § 2. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 3 of section 190.25 of the  criminal
 procedure  law  is amended and a new paragraph (a-1) is added to read as
 follows:

 prosecutor must provide an interpreter to interpret the testimony of any
 witness who does not speak the English language well enough to be readi-
 ly  understood.  Such  interpreter must, if he OR SHE has not previously
 taken the constitutional oath of office, first take an oath  before  the
 grand jury that he OR SHE will faithfully interpret the testimony of the
 witness  and  that  he  OR  SHE will keep secret all matters before such
 grand jury within his OR HER knowledge;
  § 3. Subdivision 6 of section 190.25 of the criminal procedure law  is

 SURE; AND

 ENT, AND EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (D) OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE

 GATION, CREATE A SPECIFIC THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY, OR DESPITE THE INTER-

 TION THEREFOR THAT SHALL EXPLAIN WITH SPECIFICITY, TO THE EXTENT PRACTI-
 CABLE, THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION.

 district  attorney,  and  the  grand  jury may not seek or receive legal
 advice from any other source.  Where necessary or appropriate, the court
 or the district attorney, or both, must instruct the grand jury concern-
 ing the law with respect to its duties or any matter before it, and such
 instructions must be recorded in the minutes.
  (B) NOTWITHSTANDING PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION,  OR  ANY  OTHER

 THE  SUBMISSION  OF  A  CRIMINAL  CHARGE  OR CHARGES AGAINST A PERSON OR
 PERSONS FOR AN ACT OR ACTS THAT OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN SUCH PERSON  WAS
 A  POLICE  OFFICER  OR  PEACE OFFICER, AND THAT CONCERN THE DEATH OF ANY
 PERSON THAT RESULTED FROM OR POTENTIALLY  RESULTED  FROM  INJURIES  THAT
