  Worshipful Prince Grand Lodge upon the  occasion  of
  hosting  its  142nd  Anniversary  Dinner Dance Award
  Ceremony on June 24, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend Prince Hall Lodge No. 38 Most Worshipful Prince Grand Lodge upon
the  occasion  of  hosting  its  142nd  Anniversary  Dinner  Dance Award
Ceremony to be celebrated on Saturday, June 24, 2023 at the  Renaissance
Astoria in Long Island City, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prince Hall Lodge No. 38 Most Worshipful Prince Grand Lodge
will  be  giving  away scholarships to deserving young scholars on their
way to college and awards will also be given to distinguished  community
leaders;  proceeds  from  this  event  will go toward the organization's
Scholarship Fund and Clean Water Project; and
 
  WHEREAS, The lodges in the First Masonic District consist of several
Spanish speaking brothers, P.M. Lafayette Marcus of Mt. Olive Lodge  No.
2 conceived the idea for the establishment of a lodge, the work of which
could be conducted in the Spanish language; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June 26, 1880 P.M. Lafayette Marcus, Andrew N. Portos,
John Johnson, Manuel R. Coronado, Abraham Seino, Sexto Pozo of Mt. Olive
Lodge No. 2, and Abony Brown of  Celestial  Lodge  No.  3,  presented  a
Petition  to  the  Grand  Lodge  for  a Dispensation to set up a Spanish
speaking Lodge, to be named "EL SOL de CUBA" (The SUN of CUBA); and
 
  WHEREAS, Prince Hall Lodge No. 38 Most Worshipful Prince Grand Lodge
named their first officers: Lafayette Marcus, Worshipful Master;  Manuel
R. Coronado, Senior Warden; and Sexto Pozo, Junior Warden; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A dispensation was granted for the Lodge in June 1880, and
on June 1, 1881, a warrant was issued and the  Lodge  was  numbered  38;
during  the  years  1891 to 1895, when the Spanish speaking colonials of
Cuba and Puerto Rico were actively engaged in furthering their  campaign
for  independence,  the  soil  of  the  American States had already been
dedicated to Liberty; and
 
  WHEREAS, EL SOL de CUBA No. 38 was comprised of Cubans who exercised
the Esoteric Principles of Masonry; many brothers  who  lived  far  away
from  home,  would  find  the Spanish speaking Lodge a haven of rest and
comfort; at one time there were visiting brothers to EL SOL de CUBA from
almost every Republic of South America and  the  exchange  of  fraternal
greetings were cordial and pleasurable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  year 1913, Brother Claudius E. Cyril, who was the
Elected Master, suggested to change the name of the Lodge  and  had  the
vigorous support of the past masters and members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  members voted unanimously to rename the Lodge "Prince
Hall" in honor and commemoration of the renowned Progenitor  and  Patron
Saint.  A Petition was made; on November 27, 1914, a warrant was granted
by the Grand Lodge to Brother Claudius E. Cyril, Master;  Brother  Byron
D.  Allerton, Senior Warden; Brother David F. Sheppard, Junior Warden,
with the lodge retaining its number; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Prince Hall Lodge No. 38 Most Worshipful
Prince Grand Lodge is in direct correlation to the efforts of Worshipful
Master Nikel Stephen and its members, whose involvement is,  and  always
has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations and individuals of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Prince Hall Lodge No. 38 Most Worshipful Prince Grand Lodge upon
the occasion  of  hosting  its  142nd  Anniversary  Dinner  Dance  Award
