 TAXPAYER THAT HAS BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF LABOR AS A QUAL-
 IFIED  EMPLOYER  PURSUANT  TO SECTION TWENTY-FIVE-D OF THE LABOR LAW AND
 RECEIVED AN ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT FROM SUCH COMMISSION-
 ER SHALL BE ALLOWED A CREDIT AGAINST THE TAX  IMPOSED  BY  THIS  ARTICLE
 EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT LISTED ON THE ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT
 ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF LABOR PURSUANT TO SECTION TWENTY-FIVE-D OF
 THE  LABOR  LAW.  IF THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYER'S TAXABLE YEAR IS A CALENDAR
 YEAR, THE EMPLOYER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CLAIM THE CREDIT  AS  CALCULATED
 ON  THE  ANNUAL  FINAL  CERTIFICATE  OF  TAX CREDIT ON THE CALENDAR YEAR
 RETURN FOR WHICH THE ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT WAS  ISSUED.
 IF  THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYER'S TAXABLE YEAR IS A FISCAL YEAR, THE EMPLOYER
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CLAIM THE CREDIT AS CALCULATED ON THE ANNUAL  FINAL
 CERTIFICATE  OF TAX CREDIT ON THE RETURN FOR THE FISCAL YEAR THAT ENCOM-
 PASSES THE DATE ON WHICH THE ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX  CREDIT  IS
 ISSUED.  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE TERM "QUALIFIED
 EMPLOYEE" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION (B) OF
 SECTION TWENTY-FIVE-D OF THE LABOR LAW.
  (B) THE CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION FOR ANY TAXABLE YEAR MAY
 NOT REDUCE THE TAX DUE FOR THAT YEAR TO LESS THAN THE AMOUNT  PRESCRIBED
 IN  PARAGRAPH  (D) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED TEN OF THIS
 ARTICLE. HOWEVER, IF THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER THIS  SUBDI-
 VISION  FOR  ANY  TAXABLE  YEAR REDUCES THE TAX TO THAT AMOUNT OR IF THE
 TAXPAYER OTHERWISE PAYS TAX BASED ON THE FIXED  DOLLAR  MINIMUM  AMOUNT,
 ANY AMOUNT OF CREDIT NOT DEDUCTIBLE IN THAT TAXABLE YEAR WILL BE TREATED
 AS  AN  OVERPAYMENT OF TAX TO BE CREDITED OR REFUNDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION  ONE  THOUSAND  EIGHTY-SIX  OF  THIS  CHAPTER.
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, NO INTEREST WILL BE PAID THEREON.
  (C)  THE  TAXPAYER  SHALL  BE REQUIRED TO ATTACH TO ITS TAX RETURN ITS
 ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT ISSUED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER  OF
 LABOR  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION TWENTY-FIVE-D OF THE LABOR LAW. IN NO EVENT
 SHALL THE TAXPAYER BE ALLOWED A CREDIT GREATER THAN THE  AMOUNT  OF  THE
 CREDIT  LISTED  ON  THE ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT. NOTWITH-
 STANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMMISSIONER
 AND THE COMMISSIONER'S DESIGNEES MAY RELEASE THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES  OF
 ANY TAXPAYER CLAIMING THIS CREDIT AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT EARNED BY
 THE  TAXPAYER.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  IF  A  TAXPAYER  CLAIMS THIS CREDIT
 BECAUSE IT IS A MEMBER OF A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR A PARTNER IN  A
 PARTNERSHIP,  ONLY THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EARNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT THE
 AMOUNT OF CREDIT CLAIMED BY THE TAXPAYER MAY BE RELEASED.

 ER  SHALL  BE  ALLOWED  A CREDIT AGAINST THE TAX IMPOSED BY THIS ARTICLE
 EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT LISTED ON THE ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT

 ER OF LABOR AS A QUALIFIED EMPLOYER PURSUANT TO SECTION TWENTY-FIVE-D OF

 ANNUAL FINAL CERTIFICATE OF TAX CREDIT  WAS  ISSUED.  IF  THE  QUALIFIED
 EMPLOYER'S TAXABLE YEAR IS A FISCAL YEAR, THE EMPLOYER SHALL BE ENTITLED

  (2)  IF THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER THIS SUBSECTION EXCEEDS

 HUNDRED EIGHTY-SIX OF THIS ARTICLE.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, NO INTEREST WILL

 AND THE COMMISSIONER'S DESIGNEES MAY RELEASE THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES  OF
 ANY TAXPAYER CLAIMING THIS CREDIT AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT EARNED BY
 THE  TAXPAYER.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  IF  A  TAXPAYER  CLAIMS THIS CREDIT
 BECAUSE IT IS A MEMBER OF A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, A  PARTNER  IN  A
 PARTNERSHIP,  OR  A  SHAREHOLDER IN A SUBCHAPTER S CORPORATION, ONLY THE
 AMOUNT OF CREDIT EARNED BY THE ENTITY  AND  NOT  THE  AMOUNT  OF  CREDIT
 CLAIMED BY THE TAXPAYER MAY BE RELEASED.
