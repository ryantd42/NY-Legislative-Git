  WHEREAS,  It  is the further sense of this Legislative Body that the
children of the State of New York are its  most  precious  resource  and
that,  as  such, they merit the support, encouragement and protection of

welfare  professionals,  and  other  members  of  the community who help
children and youth in foster care find permanent homes and  connections;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  proclamation  of May as Foster Care Month also renews
the commitment to ensuring a bright future for  the  more  than  400,000
children and youth in foster care; and

contribute  to  lifting  the  quality of life of the youth of this noble

experience; now, therefore, be it

memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Foster Care
