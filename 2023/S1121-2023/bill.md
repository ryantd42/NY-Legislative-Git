 Introduced  by  Sens. COONEY, HINCHEY -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the  education  law,  in  relation  to  certain  special
  services  aid  for  large  city  school  districts  and  other  school
  districts  which were not components of a board of cooperative  educa-
  tional services in the base year
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph b of subdivision 10 of section 3602 of the educa-
 tion law, as amended by section 16 of part B of chapter 57 of  the  laws
 of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  b.  Aid  for career education. There shall be apportioned to such city
 school districts and other school districts which were not components of
 a board of cooperative educational services in the base year for  pupils
 in  grades  [ten]  NINE through twelve in attendance in career education
 programs as such programs are defined by the commissioner,  subject  for
 the  purposes  of  this paragraph to the approval of the director of the
 budget, an amount for each such pupil to be computed by multiplying  the
 career education aid ratio by [three] FOUR thousand [nine] THREE hundred
 dollars.  Such  aid will be payable for weighted pupils attending career
 education programs operated by the  school  district  and  for  weighted
 pupils  for  whom  such school district contracts with boards of cooper-
 ative educational services to attend career education programs  operated
 by  a board of cooperative educational services. Weighted pupils for the
 purposes of this paragraph shall mean  the  sum  of  the  attendance  of
 students  in  grades  [ten]  NINE  through  twelve  in  career education
 sequences  in  trade,  industrial,  technical,  agricultural  or  health
 programs  plus  the  product  of  sixteen  hundredths  multiplied by the
 attendance of students in grades [ten] NINE  through  twelve  in  career
 education  sequences in business and marketing as defined by the commis-
 sioner in regulations. The career education aid ratio shall be  computed

 by  subtracting  from one the product obtained by multiplying fifty-nine
 percent by the combined wealth ratio. This aid ratio shall be  expressed
 as a decimal carried to three places without rounding, but not less than
 thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be  required  to use such amount to support career education programs in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion reduced in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current  or  a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support  of career education programs were continued at a level equal to
 or greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in  the
 preceding school year.
  §  2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to school
 years commencing on and after July 1, 2023.
