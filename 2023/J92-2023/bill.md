  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Clean Air Month in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
organizations  which  focus on improving air quality in order to benefit
the  health  of  our  citizens,  while  setting  the  highest  level  of
environmental standards for the state and country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 2023, as Clean Air
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Clean Air Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Supported by the American Lung Association, Clean Air Month
educates  people about the impact clean air can have on their lives, and
encourages them to take positive steps to help improve air quality; and
 
  WHEREAS, Clean air, is air which has a natural balance of gases such
as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and does not contain  pollutants
or allergens; clean air does not harm the environment, nor is it a cause
or trigger of health problems; and
 
  WHEREAS, Poor quality air can harm the environment and can affect us
all;  toxic air pollution is linked to serious conditions such as cancer
and chronic bronchitis, and can exacerbate pre-existing conditions  such
as asthma; and
 
  WHEREAS, Air pollution can also harm the environment; the burning of
fossil  fuels  (often  for transport or electricity generation) releases
high levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide  into  the  atmosphere;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These gases react with other gases and water to create rain
which  is acidic; acid rain raises the acid levels of water and disrupts
the natural balance of life in lakes and  rivers;  it  can  also  damage
plants and trees; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pollutants  which can affect clean air and the environment
Include: acid rain, ozone toxic air pollution, lead, sulfur dioxide, and
particulate soot, as well as carbon monoxide; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Clean Air Act came into force in  1970,  and  has  been
successful  in  reducing  air  quality  related  health  conditions  and
premature death; and
 
  WHEREAS, Clean Air Month is a time  for  New  York  and  the  entire
country  to  celebrate  the  impact the Clean Air Act has had on the way
people think about the environment and on  the  overall  health  of  its
people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  important  that  individuals are made aware of the
effects they have on air quality  and  air  pollution  and  vice  versa;
Americans can make positive steps to improving the quality of our air by
reducing  our  use of electricity, using transport more efficiently, and
supporting legislation which improves air quality; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Clean  Air  Month  aims  to promote events which
increase quality awareness and inspire people to take steps,  no  matter
how  large or small, to reduce their contribution to air pollution; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 2023, as Clean Air
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
