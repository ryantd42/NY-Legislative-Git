 AN ACT to amend the mental hygiene  law,  in  relation  to  due  process
  procedures for all adults with developmental disabilities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "protection
 of adults with developmental disabilities act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. Certain federal and  state  laws
 and  regulations  currently  provide various due process protections for
 certain categories of persons  with  developmental  disabilities.  For
 example,  the  federal  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act
 provides a child or parents of a child with a disability  important  due
 process  protections,  including  the  right  to an impartial hearing to
 challenge a determination regarding the appropriate setting for a  child
 with  a disability. New York state also provides substantial due process
 protections for the parents of a child with a disability who needs resi-
 dential care while this child is in school.
  However, when a developmentally disabled individual reaches the age of
 twenty-one, their due process protections  become  significantly  dimin-
 ished  or,  in some cases, end completely.  Specifically, those develop-
 mentally disabled adults in transitional care who reach the age of twen-
 ty-one on or before June 30, 1996 have minimal due  process  protections
 pursuant  to  section  13.38  of  the  mental hygiene law, and those who
 reached age twenty-one on or after July 1, 1996 receive no  due  process
 protections.  Some  of  New  York's  most  vulnerable adult populations,
 including those who remain continuously  disabled  and  continuously  in
 need  of  residential  or  other  forms of care, thus lose important due
 process protections simply because of their age.
  The legislature recognizes that inappropriate  or  ineffective  place-
 ments  and/or  services  for persons with developmental disabilities can

 have devastating effects for those persons  impacted,  including  abuse,
 self-harm,  improper medication or even death.  Additionally, the legis-
 lature recognizes the harm a person with developmental disabilities  can
 suffer from the disruption to his/her current treatment needs, home life
 and  familiar surroundings that an inappropriate change in placement, or
 an improper change in services, entails. Moreover,  it  is  increasingly
 the  policy of the state of New York to afford persons with disabilities
 the opportunity to participate in their treatment and residential place-
 ment decisions, and to obtain their or their guardian's consent prior to
 any changes of placement.
  The legislature hereby finds that New York state must ensure that  all
 developmentally  disabled  adults  are  afforded necessary and basic due
 process protections, and fair and meaningful  due  process  proceedings,
 relating  to  proposed  changes  in  placement,  or  proposed changes in
 services rendered, to those developmentally disabled  adults  under  the
 care  of  New  York state agencies to ensure that appropriate, effective
 treatment and placements are provided for this highly  vulnerable  adult
 population.
  In order to ensure that New York state is providing the most appropri-
 ate  setting  and  services for all persons with developmental disabili-
 ties, the legislature hereby finds that it is incumbent  upon  New  York
 state  to  institute  uniform  minimum  due  process protections for all
 persons with developmental disabilities age twenty-one and older.  These
 protections  provide,  in  part,  for  fair  and  meaningful due process
 proceedings relating to a proposed change of  placement  or  a  proposed
 change  in  services by the offices of the department of mental hygiene,
 and are intended to supplement and strengthen the patchwork  of  various
 protections  for  adults  with developmental disabilities in place under
 existing laws.
  § 3. The mental hygiene law is amended by adding a new  section  13.36
