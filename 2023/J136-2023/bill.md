  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 13, 2023, as  Korean  American  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  When  the  sons and daughters of other nations move to the
United States, the traditions they carry with them greatly  enhance  and
strengthen the American population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In December of 1902, 56 men, 21 women and 25 children left
Korea and traveled across the Pacific  Ocean  on  the  S.S.  Gaelic  and
landed in Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 13, 1903; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  McCarran  and  Walter  Act  was passed June 27, 1952,
eliminating the  Asian  immigration  ban  and  making  Asian  immigrants
eligible for citizenship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  their arrival, Korean Americans have taken root and
thrived in the United  States  through  strong  family  ties,  community
support, and hard work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Korean culture has left a sizeable footprint in the United
States, with an ever-growing number of the population learning  to  love
and appreciate Korean food, music, and traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Korean American community in New York State continues
to honor family  values  through  various  events  and  ceremonies  held
annually during the month of May; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of New York has always been richer, culturally
and  socially,  as  a  result  of  many  contributions  of  its  vibrant
Korean-American  community;  New  York  is also fortunate to have in its
midst a substantial number of citizens who trace their origins to Korea;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 13, 2023, as
Korean American Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the government of the Republic of Korea.
