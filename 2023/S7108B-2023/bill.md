  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow up to five years of previous service rendered as
 a  police  officer  with  either  the  State  University  of New York or
 Regional State Park Police Department or as an investigator in a  detec-
 tive  investigator  role  in  the  Office of the New York State Attorney
 General to become creditable under section 384-e of the  Retirement  and
 Social Security Law. Upon completion of twenty years of service and upon
 retirement,  an  affected  member would receive an additional pension of
 one-sixtieth of their final average salary for each such additional year
 credited. Affected members would be required  to  contribute  an  amount
 equal  to three percent of their prior twelve months of compensation for
 each year of service credit claimed.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be a past  service  cost  averaging  13.7%  of  an
 affected member's compensation for each year of additional service cred-
 it  granted.  All costs would be shared by the State of New York and the
 local participating employers in the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
