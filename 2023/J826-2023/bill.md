  COMMENDING  the Most Worshipful Prince Hall, Grand
  Lodge of the State of New York upon the occasion  of
  hosting  its  Gospel  Arthur J. Harris Jr. Brunch on
  May 13, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Most Worshipful Prince Hall, Grand Lodge of the State of New
York upon the occasion of hosting its Gospel Arthur J. Harris Jr. Brunch
on Saturday, May 13, 2023, at Thomasina's  Catering  Hall,  Queens,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  dedicated  Masons  of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall
Grand Lodge of  New  York  are  men  with  a  social  conscience  and  a
charitable  perspective, who are also known as Freemasons; they are part
of a fraternal organization that shares common moral ideals and esoteric
values which are based on the doctrine of  Brotherly  Love,  Relief  and
Truth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  by a group of like-minded young men, the club
received its charter in 1812 from the African Lodge of Boston, and later
received its  Grand  Lodge  title  in  1848  after  decades  of  outside
oppression, division, and change; the Freemasons of this Grand Lodge are
a standing testament to resilience, strength, and unity through a common
sense of brotherhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Gospel  Brunch began in 1986 when Past Master Richard
Glover and Past Master Donald Washington went to a Brunch  at  Copelands
Restaurant,  where they asked Fellowcraft Club of Lewis Hayden No. 69 to
have a fundraiser at Copelands Restaurant; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 15, 1987, the Fellowcraft Club of  Lewis  Hayden
No.  69  had their first Martin Luther King Gospel Brunch; during this
time, the Officers were Worshipful Master Lloyd  Jordan,  Senior  Warden
James  Howard,  and Junior Warden William Fairley; Past Master Copeland,
the owner of the restaurant, was a member  of  Fidelity  No.  97  and  a
33-degree Mason; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2018, shortly after the passing of Past Master Arthur J.
Harris  Jr.,  it  was  proposed  the  brunch be renamed in honor of this
beloved Past Master, a truly honorable and respectful man, and dedicated
servant of Lodge No. 69; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to his steadfast and unwavering  commitment  to
this  vital fraternal organization, Past Master Arthur J. Harris Jr. was
loving father and servant of God, a  retired  member  of  the  Grievance
Department  for  New York City Corrections, a loyal Brother of Omega Psi
 
Phi Incorporated Alpha Chapter, and a distinguished member of the Howard
University community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York has
truly  demonstrated  continuous service to the residents and communities
which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand  Lodge
of  New  York  is  in direct correlation to the efforts of its dedicated
members, whose involvement is, and always has been, characterized by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf  of  the  organization
and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the  members of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York,
Free and  Accepted  Masons,  past  and  present,  who  have  labored  so
conscientiously  to  secure  and  improve  the  quality  of life for the
community it serves; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend the Most Worshipful Prince Hall, Grand Lodge of the State of New
York upon the occasion of hosting its Gospel Arthur J. Harris Jr. Brunch
on May 13, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Most Worshipful Prince Hall, Grand Lodge of the State
of New York.
