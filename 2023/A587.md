 AN  ACT  to amend the general municipal law, in relation to the applica-
  tion and environmental assessment form

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  236  of the general municipal law, as amended by
 chapter 892 of the laws of 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  § 236. General powers. 1. (A) The body creating such planning  commis-
 sion  may, at any time, by ordinance or local law or resolution, provide
 that the following matters, or  any  one  or  more  of  them,  shall  be
 referred  for  report  thereon, to such commission by the board, commis-
 sion, commissioner or other public officer or officers of said  city  or
 village which is the final authority thereon before final action thereon
 by  such  authority:  the  adoption  of  any map or plan of said city or
 incorporated village, or part thereof, including drainage and  sewer  or
 water  system  plans  or  maps,  and  plans or maps for any public water
 front, or marginal street, or public structure upon, in or in connection
 with such front or street, or for any dredging,  filling  or  fixing  of
 lines with relation to said front; any change of any such maps or plans;
 the  location of any public structure upon, in or in connection with, or
 fixing lines with relation to said front; the  location  of  any  public
 building,  bridge,  statue  or monument, highway, park, parkway, square,
 playground or recreation ground, or public open place of  said  city  or
 village.  In  default of any such ordinance, local law or resolution all
 of said matters shall be so referred to said planning commission.
  (B) The body creating such planning commission may, at  any  time,  by
 ordinance, local law or resolution, fix the time within which such plan-
 ning  commission  shall report upon any matter or class of matters to be

 report within the time so fixed, the planning commission  shall  forfeit
 the  right  further  to  suspend action, as aforesaid with regard to the
 particular matter upon which it has so defaulted. In default of any such
 ordinance,  local law or resolution, no such action shall be taken until
 such report is so received, and no adoption, change, fixing or  location
 as  aforesaid by said final authority, prior thereto, shall be valid. No
 ordinance, local law or resolution shall deprive said  planning  commis-
 sion  of its right or relieve it of its duty, to report, at such time as
 it deems proper upon any matter at any time referred to it.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS  SECTION,
 THE  PROVISIONS  OF  LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS IN EFFECT ON THE DATE AN
 APPLICATION AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FORM ARE FILED WITH AN AGEN-
 CY, RELATING TO A PROPOSED ACTION, SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT  AND  CONTINUE
 TO  APPLY  TO  THE REVIEW OF SUCH ACTION UNTIL THE FINAL DECISION OF ALL
 AGENCIES HAVING APPROVAL AUTHORITY AND ANY APPEALS THEREOF.
  3. This section shall not be construed as intended to limit or  impair
 the power of any art commission, park commission or commissioner, now or
 hereafter  existing by virtue of any provision of law, to refuse consent
 to the acceptance by any municipality of the gift of any work of art  to
 said  municipality,  without  reference  of the matter, by reason of its
 proposed location or otherwise, to said planning commission.  Nor  shall
 this section be construed as intended to limit or impair any other power
 of  any  such  art commission or affect the same, except in so far as it
 provides for reference or report, or both, on any  matter  before  final
 action thereon by said art commission.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
