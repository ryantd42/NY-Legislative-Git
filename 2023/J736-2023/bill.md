  COMMENDING  ex-Chief  Richie  Shannon Jr. upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after 50 years of dedicated service to the Williston
  Park Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is justly proud to commend ex-Chief
Richie Shannon Jr. upon the occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service as a member of Company 3
with  the  Williston Park Fire Department to be celebrated at its Annual
Inspection Dinner on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the Milleridge Inn  in
Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Richie  Shannon  Jr.  joined  the  Williston  Park  Fire
Department on February 6, 1973; throughout his 50 years of  service,  he
held  several  positions within the Department including: ERS Lieutenant
(1979-1980) and  Captain  (1989-1992);  Company  No.  3  2nd  Lieutenant
(1982-1983),  1st  Lieutenant  (1983-1985),  and  Captain  (1985-1987);
Department  2nd  Assistant  Chief  (1992-1994),  1st  Assistant  Chief
(1994-1996),  and  Chief  (1996-1998); as well as Drill Team Captain for
many years; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 25, 1990, ex-Chief Richie Shannon Jr. was one of
the many dedicated firefighters to respond  to  the  Avianca  Flight  52
crash in Long Island; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Richie Shannon Jr. is one  such  firefighter;  throughout  50  years  of
devoted  service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond
the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend ex-Chief Richie Shannon Jr. upon the occasion of his designation
for special recognition after 50  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ex-Chief Richie Shannon Jr.
