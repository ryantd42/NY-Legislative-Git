  WHEREAS, Members of the United States Armed Forces,  who  served  so
faithfully and courageously in wars in which our Nation's freedom was at
stake, as well as in the preservation of peace during peacetime, deserve

  WHEREAS, Lee Ielpi proudly served his country as a Recon  Specialist
in  the United States Army during the Vietnam War, where he was actively

  WHEREAS,  In  1970,  Lee  Ielpi started his career with the New York
City Fire Department, from which he retired in 1996;  he  served  in  an

before joining Rescue 2 Special Operations Unit where he worked  for  19
years; and

service  ribbons  for  his  steadfast  and unremitting commitment to his

  WHEREAS, On the morning of the terrorist attacks in New York City on
September 11, 2001, Lee Ielpi arrived at the World Trade Center within a
half  hour  of  the  second  building  collapse  and  immediately  began

the site daily to help in any way he  could  and  served  as  a  liaison
between  the  victims'  families and recovery operations and rebuilding;
and
 
  WHEREAS, During search and rescue efforts, Lee Ielpi emotionally and

footsteps  of  his  father  as a vital and courageous member of New York

  WHEREAS,  In  memory  of  his  son  and  all the innocent people who
perished, Lee Ielpi co-founded the 9/11 Tribute Museum and  since  2002,
has  served  as  the  President  of  the  September  Eleventh  Families
Association Board of Directors; in this capacity, he served as  a  voice
for  those  lost  and  has  spoken  at various events about the value of
charitable service and anti-terrorism efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with which these men and women served their country, and must  recognize
that  no  greater  debt  is  owed than that owed to those who gave their
lives for their beloved Nation and to those who continue to  be  missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and abroad,
these men and women demonstrated their love for their country and  merit
forevermore, the highest respect of their State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  Nation's veterans deserve to be recognized, commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and Nation;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
