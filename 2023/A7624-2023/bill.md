 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. L. ROSENTHAL -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law  and  the  environmental
  conservation  law,  in  relation to prohibiting the use of primates in
  entertainment acts
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "primate protection act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that:
  a. primate abuse is a matter of worldwide concern, and the state as  a
 recognized  environmental  leader  should help assure the protection and
 welfare of primates;
  b. it is  widely  recognized  that  primates  used  for  entertainment
 purposes  ("entertainment  primates")  suffer physical and psychological
 harm due to the living  conditions  and  treatment  to  which  they  are
 subjected,  resulting  in  increased mortality with life spans only one-
 half as long as wild primates;
  c. entertainment primates live in conditions that are in no way  simi-
 lar  to  their  natural habitat, including an unnatural diet, restricted
 movement, inappropriate housing and a hostile climate;
  d. entertainment primates are  subjected  to  confinement  and  social
 isolation,  leading  to  physiological,  behavioral  and  psychological
 impairments;
  e. entertainment primates transported into the state spend  a  signif-
 icant portion of their lives inside trucks, trains or trailers, enduring
 additional physical restrictions and social isolation;
  f.  the  use of primates in entertainment provides a false and inaccu-
 rate educational experience for children  and  adults,  often  including
 performance  tricks  that are never executed by primates in the wild and
 that are stressful or harmful to the animal; and
