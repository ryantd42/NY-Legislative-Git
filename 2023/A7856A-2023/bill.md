 AN  ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to authorizing
  a residential parking system in the town of North Hempstead
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 a  lack  of  parking for residents of certain areas of the town of North
 Hempstead, Nassau county, has resulted in  traffic  hazards,  congestion
 and  air  and noise pollution. In addition, such lack of parking poses a
 hazard to residents and other pedestrians in such areas.
  The legislature further finds that a residential parking system within
 such areas would be in the  public  interest.  The  legislature  further
 finds  that  a  residential parking system within such areas will reduce
 such hazards and will reduce pollution levels as well. The  legislature,
 therefore,  hereby  declares  the necessity of this act to authorize the
 town of North Hempstead to adopt a residential parking permit system  in
 accordance with the provisions of this act.
  §  2.  The  vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new section
 1662-f to read as follows:
  § 1662-F. RESIDENTIAL PARKING SYSTEM IN THE TOWN OF  NORTH  HEMPSTEAD.
 1.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOWN
 BOARD OF THE TOWN OF NORTH HEMPSTEAD MAY, BY ADOPTION OF A LOCAL LAW  OR
 ORDINANCE,  PROVIDE  FOR A RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT SYSTEM AND FIX AND
 REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF FEES APPLICABLE TO PARKING  WITHIN  THE  AREA  IN
 WHICH SUCH PARKING SYSTEM IS IN EFFECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS
 OF THIS SECTION.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  3. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO PERMIT SHALL BE REQUIRED ON THOSE
 PORTIONS  OF  SUCH  STREET  WHERE  THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES ARE ZONED FOR

  4. THE LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE PROVIDING FOR SUCH  RESIDENTIAL  PARKING
 SYSTEM SHALL:
  (A)  SET  FORTH  FACTORS  NECESSITATING  THE ENACTMENT OF SUCH PARKING

  (F) PROVIDE THAT SUCH FEES SHALL BE CREDITED TO THE  GENERAL  FUND  OF
 THE  TOWN  OF  NORTH  HEMPSTEAD UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN SUCH LOCAL
 LAW.
  5. NO ORDINANCE SHALL BE ADOPTED PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  UNTIL  A
 PUBLIC  HEARING  THEREON HAS BEEN HAD IN THE SAME MANNER AS REQUIRED FOR
 PUBLIC HEARINGS ON LOCAL LAW PURSUANT TO THE MUNICIPAL HOME RULE LAW.
