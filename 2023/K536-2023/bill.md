  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
commemorate  Indian  Independence  Day to be celebrated August 15, 2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Republic of India is a trusted ally of this great State
and  Nation,  sharing  our  values  of  democracy,  pluralism,  freedom,
innovation, and entrepreneurship; and
 
  WHEREAS, August 15 is a national holiday in India, commemorating the
day  in  1947  when  the  United Kingdom ceded sovereignty to the Indian
Constituent Assembly, ending centuries of British rule; and
 
  WHEREAS, The transfer  of  sovereignty  was  the  culmination  of  a
decades-long  Indian  Independence movement, a predominantly non-violent
movement of protest and civil disobedience, with Mahatma Gandhi  as  one
of its most famed leaders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Indian  Independence  movement  had a profound impact
around  the  world,  impressing  its  principles  on  numerous  other
decolonization  efforts  and political movements, including the American
civil rights movement; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York City has a  deep  history  of  celebrating  Indian
Independence,  hosting  the  annual India Day Parade, the largest Indian
Independence Day parade in the world, which regularly attracts  hundreds
of thousands of attendees; and
 
  WHEREAS, Traditions to celebrate Indian Independence Day continue to
grow  in New York City, with an annual unfurling of the tricolor flag in
Times Square beginning in 2020, as well  as  multiple  iconic  buildings
being lit in the colors of the flag; and
 
  WHEREAS,  India  has  deep economic ties with this great State, with
numerous businesses from each having offices in the  other,  and  Empire
State Development having a Global New York Foreign Office in India; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States is home to the largest Indian diaspora
population  in  the  world,  composed  of  ethnically,  culturally,
linguistically, and spiritually diverse people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Indian  Americans  have made immeasurable contributions to
the arts, the STEM fields, business, philanthropy,  academics,  defense,
sports, religion, and all levels of government; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  City's  Indian American community is one of the
largest in the Western Hemisphere, with an overwhelming majority  living
in  Queens,  where  Indian  Americans  have  thrived,  possessing higher
overall incomes and educational attainment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  critical  milestone  in the history of Indian Americans
occurred in our great State, when New York City resident Bhicaji Balsara
successfully litigated to become the  first  known  naturalized  citizen
from India; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Queens  boasts  its  own  milestone  in  Indian  American
relations, being the destination of the  first  commercial  flight  from
India to the United States, when Air India operated a flight from Mumbai
to what is now John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1960; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  Indian  Independence  Day to be celebrated August 15, 2023;
and be it further

organizations in the State of New York.
