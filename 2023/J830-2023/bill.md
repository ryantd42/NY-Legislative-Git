  COMMEMORATING  the  25th  Anniversary  of  the
  Postpartum Resource Center of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  commend  those
illustrious  organizations  of  the  State  of  New York whose focus and
intent have made a substantial impact on the quality of  life  in  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  25th  Anniversary of the Postpartum Resource Center of
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Between 10 and 20 percent of new and expectant mothers  are
affected  by  perinatal  depression  and  related mood disorders such as
anxiety and psychosis; they may  also  experience  associated  symptoms,
which  are  often  overlooked and heavily stigmatized; new and expectant
mothers suffering from a perinatal mood disorder  often  feel  confused,
ashamed, and isolated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  at-risk  women  may  not  seek  help as they are not
informed  about  perinatal  depression  and  related  mood  disorders;
furthermore,  with  an  overall  lack  of  knowledge  and  screening and
assessment tools, many women are  unaware  of  treatment  and  community
supportive services for perinatal depression and related mood disorders;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Two  Long  Island  women, Sonia Murdock and Emily Sampino,
felt the need to respond to these gaps in  care,  education,  treatment,
and  support  services  related  to perinatal depression, psychosis, and
other related mood disorders impacting parents; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Postpartum Resource Center has maintained  a  statewide
hotline  and  online  resource directory, and connected thousands of new
parents to counseling services, and has provided  trainings  to  medical
professionals regarding the symptoms of postpartum mood disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Postpartum Resource Center of New York was created in
1998  to  assist  in  providing  resources  and  assistance  to  parents
throughout  the  state experiencing symptoms of perinatal and postpartum
mood disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its  distinguished  25-year  history,  the  Postpartum
Resource  Center  of New York has demonstrated continuous service to the
residents and communities which it serves across the state; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Postpartum Resource Center of  New  York
is  in  direct  correlation to the efforts of its dedicated staff, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  organization  and  the
families it serves throughout New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate 25th Anniversary of the Postpartum Resource  Center  of  New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Postpartum Resource Center of New York.
