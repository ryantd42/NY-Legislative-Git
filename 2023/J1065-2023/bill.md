  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 9, 2023, as Sneakers Day in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days that are set aside to increase awareness of American made
products that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  9,  2023,  as
Sneakers  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with the
observance of National Sneakers Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Sneakers Day celebrates sneakers, which are  shoes
designed  for use in sports or for other types of physical exercise, but
are often also used as an informal shoe for everyday use and referred to
by other terms such as tennis shoes, kicks, or gym shoes; and
 
  WHEREAS, The origins of sneakers can  be  dated  to  the  late  18th
century when people wore rubber-soled shoes called plimsolls; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Around  1892,  the  U.S.  Rubber  Company  designed  more
comfortable rubber sneakers with canvas tops, called Keds; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1917, Henry Nelson McKinney, an advertising agent,  used
the  term  "sneaker"  because the rubber sole made the shoe stealthy and
quiet, and much easier to "sneak" around; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1923, an Indiana  basketball  star  named  Chuck  Taylor
endorsed  the  shoes,  after  which came the Chuck Taylor All-Stars, the
best-selling basketball shoes of all time; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sneakers went international in 1924, when  a  German  named
Adi Dassler created a sneaker he named after himself, Adidas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sales  of  sneakers  really took off in 1984, when Michael
Jordan signed a contract to wear a Nike shoe  called  Air  Jordans,  the
most famous sneaker ever made; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  advent  of  the  internet,  sneaker trends from
previous decades were accelerated due to the invention  of  smartphones;
globalization  and  the  advancement  of  new  technologies  have  also
increased the worldwide spread of sneaker popularity with  social  media
as a communication tool; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2020,  the  global  sneaker  market  was  valued  at
approximately US$79 billion and is predicted to reach US$120 billion  by
2026; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sneakers  were  born  in  the  United  States  and  have
continually evolved throughout the last 131 years since the introduction
 
of the Keds in 1892; sneakers  are  designed  for  sports  and  physical
exercise which is important for overall wellness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  the  health  benefits  of sneakers, they
epitomize cultural trends such as the Converse with rock  'n  roll,  and
Puma,  Nike,  and Adidas with hip-hop; today, collectors of sneakers are
known as sneakerheads; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sneakers are comfortable, and many people love to wear them
to any occasion whether you are just relaxing at home,  playing  sports,
going to school, or even for work; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  9,  2023,  as
Sneakers Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
