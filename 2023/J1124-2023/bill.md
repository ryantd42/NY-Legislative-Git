  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of The Alliance
  of  Resident  Theaters/New  York,  commonly known as
  A.R.T./New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to  honor  and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  institutions  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  The  Alliance  of  Resident
Theaters/New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  What  was  then  known  as the "Off Broadway Alliance" was
founded in 1972 as a small collective focused on promoting community and
collaboration across a budding field; and
 
  WHEREAS, A.R.T./New York has since become an essential pillar  of  a
diverse  member  community  of  nearly  500  theatres and 150 individual
producer  and  artist  members,  establishing  itself  as  the  single
membership  organization  serving  the full breadth of New York City and
State's not-for-profit theatres; and
 
  WHEREAS, A.R.T./New York serves New York City's theatrical ecosystem
by providing artists with the  essential  resources  they  need  to  put
creative  ideas  on  stage,  such  as  space,  education,  funding,  and
community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In furtherance of this mission,  A.R.T./New  York  operates
subsidized  office,  rehearsal and theater spaces out of three locations
in New York City: South Oxford Space in Fort Greene Brooklyn, 520 Eighth
Avenue, and the A.R.T./New York Theatres on 53rd and 10th Avenue.
 
  WHEREAS, A.R.T./New York's dedicated and knowledgeable staff  offers
trainings,  educational  programs,  and  other support to the theatrical
workforce, addressing topics ranging from specialized sexual  harassment
trainings to financial planning to removing hiring bias and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Guided  by  its  organizational  values  of  opportunity,
community,  innovation,  empowerment,  justice  and  equity,  and
accountability,  the  unifying  service  at A.R.T./New York is community
building- whether  that  is  through  advocacy,  member  convenings,  or
responsive programming.; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate  A.R.T./New  York's  50th  Anniversary,  recognizing  the
significance  of  the  role  it  continues  to  play  in  supporting and
enriching New York theater, contributing immeasurably to New York City's
cultural fabric and economic vitality; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to The Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York.
