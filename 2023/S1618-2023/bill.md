 documentation for final approval and issuance by the board of regents in
 accordance with subdivisions five-a and five-b of this section.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any general, special or local law to the contra-
 ry, no charter school having a charter that was issued and  approved  on
 or  before  the  effective  date  of this act shall enter into, renew or
 extend the duration of any agreement with a for-profit or not-for-profit
