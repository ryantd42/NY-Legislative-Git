  § 12.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 9 of section 995-c of  the  execu-
 tive  law,  as  added by chapter 524 of the laws of 2002, is amended and

  (b)  As  prescribed in this paragraph, if an individual, either volun-
 tarily or pursuant to a warrant or order of  a  court,  has  provided  a
 sample  for  DNA  testing in connection with the investigation or prose-
 cution of a crime and (i) no  criminal  action  against  the  individual
 relating  to  such  crime  was  commenced within the period specified by
 section 30.10 of the criminal procedure law, or (ii) a  criminal  action
 was  commenced  against  the  individual  relating  to  such crime which
 resulted in a complete acquittal, OR A DISMISSAL AND THE MATTER WILL NOT
 BE TRIED OR RETRIED, or (iii) a criminal action against  the  individual
 relating  to  such  crime resulted in a conviction that was subsequently
 reversed or vacated, or for which the individual was  granted  a  pardon
 pursuant  to article two-A of this chapter, such individual may apply to
 the supreme court or the court in which the judgment of  conviction  was
 originally  entered  for  an  order directing the expungement of any DNA
 record and any samples, analyses, or other documents relating to the DNA
 testing of such individual in connection with the investigation or pros-
 ecution of such crime. A copy of such application shall be served on the
 district attorney and an order directing expungement may be  granted  if
 the  court finds that the individual has satisfied the conditions of one
 of the subparagraphs of this paragraph; that if a judgment of conviction
 was  reversed  or  vacated,  all  appeals  relating  thereto  have  been
 concluded  and  the individual will not be retried, or, if a retrial has
 occurred, the trier of fact has rendered a verdict of  complete  acquit-
 tal, and that expungement will not adversely affect the investigation or
 prosecution  of  some other person or persons for the crime.  NOTHING IN
 THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL PREVENT A COURT, AT AN EARLIER TIME, FROM  ORDERING
 EXPUNGEMENT  IN  THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IN THE INTERESTS
 OF JUSTICE, IN RESPONSE TO AN APPLICATION MADE ON NOTICE TO THE DISTRICT
 ATTORNEY BY THE PERSON WHO PROVIDED SUCH DNA SAMPLE. If an order direct-
 ing the expungement of any DNA record and any samples, analyses or other
 documents relating to the DNA testing of such individual is issued, such
 record and any samples, analyses,  or  other  documents  shall,  at  the
 discretion  of  the  possessor thereof, be destroyed or returned to such
 individual or to the attorney who represented him or her  in  connection
 with the application for the order of expungement. THE PERSON DESTROYING
 OR  RETURNING  SUCH  RECORD, SAMPLES, ANALYSES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS SHALL
 MAINTAIN A RECORD CERTIFYING THE DATE, TIME AND MANNER OF DESTRUCTION OR
 RETURN AND IDENTIFYING THE PERSON OR  PERSONS  DESTROYING  OR  RETURNING
 SAME.  THE PERSON DESTROYING OR RETURNING SAME SHALL SEND A COPY OF THIS
 RECORD  TO  THE  PERSON  WHO SUBMITTED THE SAMPLE OR TO THE ATTORNEY WHO
 REPRESENTED HIM OR HER IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPLICATION FOR THE  ORDER
 OF EXPUNGEMENT.
