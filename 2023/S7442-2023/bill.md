  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "omnibus
 renewable energy progress act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and statement of purpose. The legislature
 hereby finds, determines, and declares:
  1. Chapter 106 of the laws of 2019 enacted the New York state  climate
 leadership  and community protection act (the "CLCPA") and chapter 58 of
 the laws of 2020 enacted the accelerated  renewable  energy  growth  and
 community  benefit  act ("AREGCBA"), both of which are aimed at fighting
 climate change and decarbonizing the electricity  sector  in  New  York.
 These two acts, among other things:
  (a) directed the department of environmental conservation to establish
 a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit as a percentage of 1990 emis-
 sions as follows: (i) 2030: 60% of 1990 emissions; and (ii) 2050: 15% of
 1990 emissions;
  (b)  directed  the  public service commission to establish programs to
 require that a minimum of 70% statewide electric generation be  produced
 by  renewable  energy  systems  by  2030,  and that by the year 2040 the
 statewide electrical demand system will generate zero emissions;
  (c) created the office of renewable energy siting  to  coordinate  the
 environmental  review  and  permitting  of  large-scale renewable energy
 projects;
  (d) directed the public service commission to initiate a comprehensive
 study of the state's power grid  to  identify  distribution  and  trans-
 mission  infrastructure  needed  to  enable  the state to meet the CLCPA
 targets, and based on such study, develop plans  that  provide  for  the
 timely  development  of  local  transmission  and  distribution  system
 upgrades by the state's regulated utilities and the  Long  Island  power
 authority;  and  identify  bulk  transmission investments that should be
 undertaken, including projects that should  be undertaken on  an  expe-
 dited  basis in cooperation with the power authority of the state of New
 York; and
  (e) directed the department of environmental conservation to create an
 endangered species mitigation bank fund to improve the efficiency of the
 species protection review and mitigation process for large scale renewa-
 ble energy facilities.
  2. In order to achieve the CLCPA targets and the goals of the AREGCBA,
 the state shall take appropriate action to ensure that:
  (a) new renewable energy generation projects can be sited in a  timely
 and  cost-effective  manner  that  continues to include consideration of
 local laws concerning zoning, the environment or public health and safe-
 ty, and continues to avoid or minimize, to the maximum extent  practica-
 ble, adverse environmental impacts; and
  (b)  renewable energy can be efficiently and cost-effectively injected
 into the state's distribution and transmission system  for  delivery  to
 regions of the state where it is needed; and
  (c)  renewable  energy  property  tax assessment at the local level is
 standardized and local government entities have the flexibility to bene-
 fit from increased tax revenue from renewable energy projects; and
 S. 7442  3
 
  (d) state entities are procuring renewable energy and  energy  storage
 to power their own operations to the greatest extent possible; and
  (e)  local government entities have the ability to utilize a statewide
 decommissioning mechanism to ensure that renewable energy project owners
 are financially accountable for the decommissioning of  projects  in  as
 standardized a system as possible; and
  (f)  the  department of environmental conservation assesses and recom-
 mends the best future methods of solar panel disposal at  their  end-of-
 life; and
  (g)  the  siting  and  approval of renewable energy projects will help
 communities across the state be  part  of  the  climate  solution  while
 creating  good-paying  jobs  and realizing key economic and social bene-
 fits.
  3. A public policy purpose would be served and the  interests  of  the
 people of the state would be advanced by the provisions of this act.
  §  3.  This  act enacts into law major components of legislation which
 are necessary to implement the "omnibus renewable energy progress  act".
 Each  component  is wholly contained within a Part identified as Parts A
 through M. The effective date for each  particular  provision  contained
 within  such  Part  is  set  forth in the last section of such Part. Any
 provision in any section contained within a Part, including  the  effec-
 tive  date  of  the  Part, which makes a reference to a section "of this
 act", when used in connection with that particular component,  shall  be
 deemed  to  mean  and  refer to the corresponding section of the Part in
 which it is found.  Section five of this act  sets  forth  the  general
 effective date of this act.

 lation promulgated thereto, governing the collection, return or  recycl-
 ing  of  solar  photovoltaic  modules or solar photovoltaic panels shall
 upon the effective date of this act be preempted.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART E
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 5 of section 7 of part JJJ of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2020, amending the public service law and other laws relating to
 accelerating the growth of renewable energy facilities to meet  critical
 state energy policy goals, is amended to read as follows:
  5. The legislature finds and determines that timely development of the
 bulk  transmission investments identified in the state bulk transmission
 investment plan is in the public interest of the people of the state  of
 New  York.  The  legislature further finds and determines that the power
 authority of the state of New York ("power authority") owns and operates
 backbone electric transmission assets in  New  York,  has  rights-of-way
 that  can  support  in  whole  or  in  part bulk transmission investment
 projects, and has the financial stability, access to capital,  technical
 expertise  and  experience to effectuate expeditious development of bulk
 transmission investments  needed  to  help  the  state  meet  the  CLCPA
 targets,  and  thus  it is appropriate for the power authority as deemed
 feasible and advisable by its trustees, by itself  or  in  collaboration
 with  other parties as it determines to be appropriate, to develop those
 bulk transmission investments found by the commission to be needed expe-
 ditiously to achieve CLCPA targets ("priority transmission projects").
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS AND DETERMINES, FOLLOWING THE  ISSUANCE
 OF  THE  CLIMATE  SCOPING  PLAN REQUIRED BY THE CLCPA, THAT IT IS IN THE
 PUBLIC INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW  YORK  FOR  THE  POWER
 AUTHORITY  TO  PROPOSE  A  MINIMUM  OF  FOUR  SUCH PRIORITY TRANSMISSION
 PROJECTS BY DECEMBER 21, 2023 TO ADDRESS THE AREAS OF  HIGHEST  NEED  ON
 THE  BULK  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND FURTHER FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE  LIMITATIONS  ON  THE
 CAPACITY  TO INTERCONNECT NEW POWER GENERATING FACILITIES.  TWO OF THESE
 FOUR PROJECTS SHALL ADDRESS THE LOCATIONS OF HIGHEST NEEDS FOR DEPLOYING
 S. 7442  8
 
 ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE  NEW  YORK  INDE-
 PENDENT  SYSTEM  OPERATOR IN ITS MOST RECENT TWENTY YEAR SYSTEM OUTLOOK.
 TWO OF THE FOUR PROJECTS SHALL PROPOSE GRID INFRASTRUCTURE  UPGRADES  IN
 LOCATIONS  CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED BY THE GRID FOR INTERCONNECTING RENEWA-
 BLE ENERGY PROJECTS, WHERE THERE IS OTHERWISE THE POTENTIAL  TO  DEVELOP
 RENEWABLE  ENERGY  PROJECTS  (TO  ESTABLISH "RENEWABLE ENERGY ZONES") AS
 DETERMINED BY THE POWER AUTHORITY. THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  EXPEDITIOUSLY
 REVIEW AND APPROVE OR REJECT THESE FOUR PROPOSALS.
  The  power authority shall, through a public process, solicit interest
 from potential co-participants in each project it has agreed to  develop
 and  assess  whether any joint development would provide for significant
 additional benefits in achieving the CLCPA targets. The power  authority
 may  thereafter determine to undertake the development of the project on
 its own, or undertake the project jointly with one or more other parties
 on such terms and conditions as the power authority finds to  be  appro-
 priate  and,  notwithstanding  any other law to the contrary, enter into
 such agreements and take such other actions the power  authority  deter-
 mines to be necessary in order to undertake and complete timely develop-
 ment  of the project.  The intent of this act is for the power authority
 to develop priority transmission projects authorized  in  this  subdivi-
 sion.  For priority projects that the authority determines to undertake
 and that are not substantially within  the  power  authority's  existing
 rights  of way, the authority shall, as deemed feasible and advisable by
 its board of trustees, select  private  sector  participants  through  a
 competitive bidding process, provided however that priority transmission
 projects  is  not  intended to include generation lead lines, or repairs
 to, replacement of or upgrades to the power authority's own transmission
 assets.
  TO FOSTER THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY SOLAR  IN  NEW  YORK,
 THE  COMMISSION AND THE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY SHOULD
 DETERMINE A THRESHOLD  FOR  NON-AFFORDABILITY  FOR  THE  INTERCONNECTION
 COSTS  REQUIRED  BY  AN  INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY. WHEN THE REQUIRED LOCAL
 SYSTEM UPGRADE COSTS FOR INTERCONNECTING A COMMUNITY SOLAR PROJECT OR  A
 GROUP OF COMMUNITY SOLAR PROJECTS ARE ABOVE THE NON-AFFORDABILITY THRES-
 HOLD,  THE POWER AUTHORITY SHALL INTERVENE AND IMPLEMENT A MECHANISM FOR
 PROVIDING LOW INTEREST FINANCING FOR THE COSTS OF LOCAL SYSTEM  UPGRADES
 ABOVE  THE  THRESHOLD  FOR THE DEVELOPER OR DEVELOPERS OF SUCH COMMUNITY
 SOLAR PROJECT OR PROJECTS.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately;  provided,  however,  the
 amendments  to  section  7 of part JJJ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020
 made by section one of this act shall not  affect  the  repeal  of  such
 section and shall expire therewith.
 
  PART F

 copy of the charter of such corporation shall be filed in the office  of
 the  commission, together with a verified statement of the president and
 secretary of the corporation, showing that it has received the  required
 consent  of  the proper municipal authorities. The commission shall have
 power to grant the permission and approval herein specified whenever  it
 shall  after  due hearing determine that such construction or such exer-
 cise of the right, privilege or franchise is  convenient  and  necessary
 for  the  public service. In making such a determination, the commission
 shall consider the economic feasibility of the corporation,  the  corpo-
 ration's  ability  to  finance  improvements  of a gas plant or electric
 plant, render safe, adequate and reliable service, and provide just  and
 reasonable rates, and whether issuance of a certificate is in the public
 interest. Except as provided in article fourteen-A of the general munic-
 ipal  law,  no  municipality shall build, maintain and operate for other
 than municipal purposes any works or systems  for  the  manufacture  and
 supplying  of gas or electricity for lighting purposes without a certif-
 icate of authority granted by the  commission.  If  the  certificate  of
 authority  is  refused,  no  further  proceedings shall be taken by such
 municipality before the commission, but a new application  may  be  made
 therefor after one year from the date of such refusal.
  § 2. The closing paragraph of section 69 of the public service law, as
 amended  by  chapter  222  of  the  laws  of 1991, is amended to read as
 follows:
  A permission or approval by the public service commission of a  merger
 or  consolidation  shall not be deemed to be an approval of the value of
 any property or accounts of any company involved in the  merger  at  the
 time  of  the  merger,  nor  shall  any  such  permission or approval be
 construed to be a certification by the public  service  commission  that
 the  bonds  and/or  capital stock of any such merged, merging or consol-
 idating corporations are represented in value by  commensurate  physical
 assets  of  such corporations, nor shall such approval be evidence as to
 the value of any such property or account in subsequent rate proceedings
 or before any court or public body. NO PROVISION OF THIS  SECTION  SHALL

  PART H
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. In  2019,  the  state
 enacted  the  historic  New  York state climate leadership and community
 protection act to mitigate the impacts  of  climate  change  and  reduce
 greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  anthropogenic  sources  100% over 1990
 levels by the year 2050. In 2020,  the  state  enacted  the  accelerated
 renewable  energy  growth  and community benefit act, which provided for
 the expedited siting of major renewable energy  facilities  and  related
 transmission.  The legislature hereby finds and declares that to mean-
 ingfully and timely achieve the historic goals mandated in the New  York
 state  climate  leadership and community protection act, and to meet the
 technology-specific  requirements  set  forth  therein,  including  the
 installation  of  wind  and  solar-powered  electric  generation,  the
 construction of new and repowered wind turbines and solar arrays  is  an
 urgent  matter  of great importance to New York. The legislature further
 finds that current  rules,  regulations,  and  policies  addressing  the
 transport  of  large loads on the state highways and the thruway present
 impediments to the efficient transport of  construction  materials  used
 for  these  projects, including large loads such as wind turbines, which
 is inconsistent with the  goals  of  the  accelerated  renewable  energy
 growth  and  community  benefit act. Because of the unprecedented volume
 and size of materials planned for transport, the current rules regarding
 the use of police escorts for the transport of such loads may result  in
 delays,  shortages  of  police  officer  escorts, and retention of truck
 traffic, that may hinder construction of major renewable energy  facili-
 ties. Therefore, it is the intent of this act to supersede any such rule
 or policy, and to allow materials used for the construction of any major
 renewable energy facility to be transported on state highways and on the
 thruway  safely  using  either  a  police  escort, or a private security
 escort.
  § 2. (a) For the purposes of this act, the term "major renewable ener-
 gy facility" shall have the same meaning as defined in section  94-c  of
 the executive law.
  (b) Notwithstanding any other law, rule, regulation, or internal poli-
 cy  of any state department, agency, public authority, or public benefit
 corporation, vehicles carrying materials intended for  the  construction
 of any major renewable energy facility, including oversize and superload
 transport  vehicles,  shall  be  permitted  to travel on the thruway and
 state highways, in compliance with the requirements set forth in  subdi-
 vision  (c)  of this section, on any day of the week, including Saturday
 and Sunday.
  (c) Notwithstanding any other law, rule, regulation, or internal poli-
 cy of any state department, agency, public authority, or public  benefit
 corporation,  vehicles  carrying materials intended for the construction
 of any major renewable energy facility, including oversize and superload
 transport vehicles, shall be permitted to travel either  with  a  police
 S. 7442  11
 
 escort,  including  but  not limited to environmental conservation offi-
 cers, parks police, county sheriff deputies or the  national  guard,  or
 with a private security certified escort vehicle as that term is defined
 in  17  NYCRR 154-1.12. The state shall not bear the cost of any private
 security escort utilized under this section.
  (d) Vehicles carrying materials intended for the construction  of  any
 major renewable energy facility, including oversize and superload trans-
 port  vehicles,  shall  have a certified annual inspection demonstrating
 compliance with all applicable state and  federal  safety  standards  in
 lieu  of  a state police level I full inspection, provided the certified
 inspection is performed within seven calendar  days  of  the  trip,  the
 vehicle  is not subject to commercial use in the interim, and the opera-
 tor of such vehicle makes satisfactory inspection paperwork available to
 the state police, the department  of  transportation,  and  the  thruway
 authority upon request.
  (e)  All  state  departments,  agencies, public authorities, or public
 benefit corporations shall prioritize the permitting  and  requests  for
 approval for such travel for the transport of materials intended for use
 in  a major renewable energy facility. The department of transportation,
 in consultation with the thruway authority and the state  police,  shall
 establish  through regulation a program for the certification of private
 security escorts authorized to escort  vehicles  transporting  materials
 intended for the construction of any major renewable energy facility.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

 system equipment shall not include interest or other finance charges.
  (D)  Such  qualified expenditures for the lease of solar energy system
 equipment or the purchase of  power  under  an  agreement  described  in
 clauses  (ii)  or  (iii)  of  subparagraph  (A)  of this paragraph shall
 include an amount equal to all payments made  during  the  taxable  year
 under  such  agreement.  Provided,  however,  such credits shall only be
 allowed for fourteen years after the first taxable year  in  which  such
 credit  is  allowed.  Provided further, however, the twenty-five percent
 limitation in paragraph one of this subsection shall only apply  to  the
 total  aggregate amount of all payments to be made pursuant to an agree-
 ment referenced in clauses (ii) or (iii) of  subparagraph  (A)  of  this
 paragraph,  and  shall  not  apply  to individual payments made during a
 taxable year under such agreement except to the extent  such  limitation
 on an aggregate basis has been reached.
  (3)  Solar  energy  system  equipment.  The  term "solar energy system
 equipment" shall  mean  an  arrangement  or  combination  of  components
 utilizing solar radiation, which, when installed in a residence, produc-
 es  AND STORES energy designed to provide heating, cooling, hot water or
 electricity for use in such residence. Such  arrangement  or  components
 shall  not  include equipment connected to solar energy system equipment
 that is a component of part or parts of a  non-solar  energy  system  or
 which  uses  any sort of recreational facility or equipment as a storage
 medium. Solar energy system equipment that generates  AND  STORES  elec-
 tricity  for  use in a residence must conform to applicable requirements
 set forth in section sixty-six-j of the public  service  law.  Provided,
 however,  where solar energy system equipment is purchased and installed
 by a condominium management association or a cooperative housing  corpo-
 ration,  for  purposes of this subsection only, the term "ten kilowatts"
 in such section sixty-six-j shall be read  as  ["fifty]  "TEN  kilowatts
 S. 7442  16
 
 MULTIPLIED  BY  THE NUMBER OF OWNER-OCCUPIED UNITS IN THE COOPERATIVE OR
 CONDOMINIUM MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION."
  (4)  Multiple  taxpayers.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
 purchased and installed in a principal residence shared by two  or  more
 taxpayers,  the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection for
 each such taxpayer shall be prorated according to the percentage of  the
 total  expenditure for such solar energy system equipment contributed by
 each taxpayer.
  (5) Proportionate  share.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
 purchased  and  installed  by  a condominium management association or a
 cooperative housing corporation, a taxpayer  who  is  a  member  of  the
 condominium management association or who is a tenant-stockholder in the
 cooperative  housing  corporation may for the purpose of this subsection
 claim a proportionate share of the total expense as the expenditure  for
 the  purposes  of the credit attributable to [his] THEIR principal resi-
 dence.
  (6) Grants. For purposes of determining the amount of the  expenditure
 incurred in purchasing and installing solar energy system equipment, the
 amount  of  any  federal, state or local grant received by the taxpayer,
 which was used for the purchase and/or installation  of  such  equipment
 and  which was not included in the federal gross income of the taxpayer,
 shall not be included in the amount of such expenditures.
  (7)  When credit allowed. The credit  provided  for  herein  shall  be
 allowed  with  respect  to  the  taxable year, commencing after nineteen
 hundred ninety-seven, in which the  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
 placed in service.
  (8)  Carryover  of credit. If the amount of the credit, and carryovers
 of such credit, allowable under this subsection  for  any  taxable  year
 shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, such excess amount may be
 carried  over  to the five taxable years next following the taxable year
 with respect to which the credit is allowed and may be deducted from the
 taxpayer's tax for such year or years. FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR
 AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR,  IF  THE  AMOUNT  OF  THE
 CREDIT  ALLOWABLE  UNDER THIS SUBSECTION SHALL EXCEED THE TAXPAYER'S TAX
 LIABILITY FOR SUCH YEAR, AND THE TAXPAYER MEETS THE DEFINITION  OF  LOW-
 TO-MODERATE  INCOME  OR RESIDES IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY, AS IDENTI-
 FIED PURSUANT TO SECTION 75-0111 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION  LAW,

 and building code council] BOARD provided that such exceptions shall not
 prevent the attainment of the compliance  goals  set  forth  in  section
 410(2)(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
  2.  (a) The [state fire prevention and building code council] BOARD is
 authorized, from time to time as it  deems  appropriate  and  consistent
 with  the  purposes  of  this  article, to review and amend the code, or
 adopt a new code, through rules and regulations provided that  the  code
 remains  cost  effective  with  respect  to building construction in the
 state. In determining whether the code remains cost effective, the [code
 council] BOARD shall consider (i) whether the  life-cycle  costs  for  a
 building  will  be  recovered  through  savings in energy costs over the
 design life of the building under a life-cycle cost  analysis  performed
 under  methodology  as established by the New York state energy research
 and development authority in regulations which may be updated from  time
 to  time,  and (ii) secondary or societal effects, such as reductions in
 S. 7442  18

 greenhouse gas emissions, as defined in regulations. Before  publication
 of  a  notice  of  proposed  rule making establishing the methodology or
 defining secondary or societal effects, the president of  the  authority
 shall  conduct  public  meetings to provide meaningful opportunities for
 public comment from  all  segments  of  the  population  that  would  be
 impacted  by  the regulations, including persons living in disadvantaged
 communities as identified by the climate justice  working  group  estab-
 lished under section 75-0111 of the environmental conservation law.  For
 residential  buildings,  the  code  shall  meet  or exceed the then most
 recently published International Energy Conservation  Code,  or  achieve
 equivalent  or greater energy savings; and for commercial buildings, the
 code shall meet or exceed the then most recently published ASHRAE  90.1,
 or achieve equivalent or greater energy savings.
  (b) When adopting the first amended version of the code next following
 the  effective  date  of [the] chapter THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR of the
 laws of two thousand twenty-two [that  added  this  paragraph]  and  any
 subsequent  codes, the [state fire prevention and building code council]
 BOARD shall use its best efforts to  adopt  provisions  for  residential
 buildings  that  achieve  energy  savings  greater  than  energy savings
 achieved by  the  then  most  recently  published  International  Energy
 Conservation  Code and to adopt provisions for commercial buildings that
 achieve energy savings greater than energy savings achieved by the  then
 most  recently  published ASHRAE 90.1, both at levels recommended by the
 New York state energy research and development authority, provided  that
 the  [state  fire prevention and building code council] BOARD determines
 that such advanced energy savings can be achieved  while  still  meeting
 the cost effectiveness considerations contemplated by this subdivision.
  3.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the  [state fire
 prevention and building code  council]  BOARD  in  accordance  with  the
 mandate  under  this  article shall have exclusive authority among state
 agencies to promulgate a construction code incorporating energy  conser-
 vation features and clean energy features applicable to the construction
 of  any building, including but not limited to greenhouse gas reduction.
 Any other code, rule or regulation heretofore promulgated or enacted  by
 any  other  state agency, incorporating specific energy conservation and
 clean energy requirements applicable to the construction of  any  build-
 ing,  shall  be  superseded  by  the  code  promulgated pursuant to this
 section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  section  shall
 be deemed to expand the powers of the [council] BOARD to include matters
 that  are  exclusively  within  the statutory jurisdiction of the public
 service commission, the department of  environmental  conservation,  the
 office of renewable energy siting or another state entity.
  4.  The  secretary of state is authorized to issue written interpreta-
 tions of the code upon written request of  a  permit  applicant  or  the
 official  responsible  for  the  administration  and  enforcement of the
 provisions of the code. Subsequent enforcement  of  the  code  shall  be
 consistent with such written interpretations.
  §  4. Subdivision 5 of section 11-104 of the energy law, as amended by
 chapter 374 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  5. The [state fire prevention and building  code  council]  BOARD,  in
 consultation  with  the  commissioner of the department of parks, recre-
 ation and historic preservation, is authorized to  adopt  exemptions  to
 such  uniform  standards  and  requirements  for  historic  buildings as
 defined in section 11-102 of  this  article,  to  the  extent  that  the
 uniform  standards  and requirements would threaten, degrade, or destroy
 the historic form, fabric, or function of such historic buildings.

  § 5. Section 11-105 of the energy law, as amended by  chapter  560  of
 the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  § 11-105. Limitation of application. Notwithstanding the provisions of
 subdivision  one  of  section  11-103  of  this article, the [state fire
 prevention and building code council] BOARD, by  regulation,  may  limit
 the  application  of any portion of the code so as to include or exclude
 classes or types of buildings, according to the use thereof or the  cost
 effectiveness  of  the  code  with  respect to any such class or type of
 building, or according to any other distinction as  may  make  differen-
 tiation  or  separate  classification or regulation necessary, proper or
 desirable, provided however, that such  limitation:  (1)  is  consistent
 with  the purposes of this article and the criteria set forth in section
 11-104 of this article, (2) does not render the code  inconsistent  with
 the  energy savings requirements of subdivision two of section 11-103 of
 this article, and (3) whether considered  individually  or  collectively
 with  other  limitations, will not prevent the attainment of the compli-
 ance goals set forth in section 410(2)(c) of the American  Recovery  and
 Reinvestment Act of 2009.
  §  6. Subdivision 2 of section 11-109 of the energy law, as amended by
 chapter 560 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  Any  municipality  which  adopts  a  local  energy  conservation
 construction  code  in accordance with this section shall file a copy of
 such code and any amendments or revisions thereof with the  [state  fire
 prevention  and  building  code  council] BOARD within thirty days after
 promulgation or adoption  of  such  local  code  or  any  amendments  or
 revisions thereof. If the municipality files such copy within such thir-
 ty day time period, the municipality may enforce such local code, amend-
 ment  or revision until and unless the [state fire prevention and build-
 ing code council] BOARD shall determine that such local code,  amendment
 or  revision  is not more restrictive than the code. If the municipality
 fails to file such copy within such thirty day time period, the  munici-
 pality  may not enforce such local code, amendment or revision until and
 unless the [state fire prevention and building code council] BOARD shall
 determine that such local code, amendment or revision is  more  restric-
 tive than the code.
