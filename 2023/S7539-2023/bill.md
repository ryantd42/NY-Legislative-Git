  §  2.  Section  6210  of the civil practice law and rules, as added by
 chapter 860 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 6210. Order of attachment on notice;  temporary  restraining  order;
 contents.  Upon a motion on notice for an order of attachment, the court
 may, without notice to the  defendant,  grant  a  temporary  restraining
 order  prohibiting  the transfer of assets by a garnishee as provided in
 subdivision (b) of section 6214. WHEN ATTACHMENT IS SOUGHT  PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION  SIX  OF  SECTION  6201,  AND  IF  THE EMPLOYER CONTESTS THE
 MOTION, THE COURT SHALL HOLD A HEARING  WITHIN  TEN  DAYS  OF  WHEN  THE
 EMPLOYER'S  RESPONSE  TO  PLAINTIFFS'  MOTION FOR ATTACHMENT IS DUE. The
 contents of the order of attachment granted  pursuant  to  this  section
 shall be as provided in subdivision (a) of section 6211.
  §  3.  Subdivision  (b)  of section 6211 of the civil practice law and
 rules, as amended by chapter 566 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (b) Confirmation of order. Except where  an  order  of  attachment  is
 granted  on  the  ground  specified in subdivision one OR SIX of section
 6201, an order of attachment granted without notice shall  provide  that
 within  a period not to exceed five days after levy, the plaintiff shall
 move, on such notice as the court shall direct  to  the  defendant,  the
 garnishee, if any, and the sheriff, for an order confirming the order of
 attachment.  Where  an  order of attachment without notice is granted on
 the ground specified in subdivision one OR  SIX  of  section  6201,  the
 court shall direct that the statement required by section 6219 be served
 within  five days, that a copy thereof be served upon the plaintiff, and
 the plaintiff shall move  within  ten  days  after  levy  for  an  order
 confirming  the  order  of attachment. If the plaintiff upon such motion
 shall show that the statement has not been served and that the plaintiff
 will be unable to satisfy the requirement of subdivision (b) of  section
 6223 until the statement has been served, the court may grant one exten-
 sion of the time to move for confirmation for a period not to exceed ten
 days. If plaintiff fails to make such motion within the required period,
 the  order  of  attachment and any levy thereunder shall have no further
 effect and shall be vacated upon motion. Upon the motion to confirm, the
 provisions of subdivision (b) of section 6223 shall apply. An  order  of
 attachment  granted  without notice may provide that the sheriff refrain
 from taking any property levied upon into his  OR  HER  actual  custody,
 pending further order of the court.

 dollars,  a  specified part thereof conditioned that the plaintiff shall
 pay to the defendant all costs and damages, including reasonable  attor-
 ney's  fees,  which  may be sustained by reason of the attachment if the
 defendant recovers judgment or if it is finally decided that the  plain-
 tiff  was not entitled to an attachment of the defendant's property, and
 the balance conditioned that the plaintiff shall pay to the sheriff  all
 of his OR HER allowable fees.

 minutes  of the proceedings of its shareholders and record of sharehold-
 ers and to make extracts therefrom for any purpose reasonably related to
 such person's interest as a shareholder, LABORER, SERVANT  OR  EMPLOYEE,
 PROVIDED  THE  PURPOSE  REASONABLY  RELATED  TO A PERSON'S INTEREST AS A
 LABORER, SERVANT OR EMPLOYEE SHALL BE TO OBTAIN  THE  NAMES,  ADDRESSES,
 AND  VALUE  OF  SHAREHOLDERS'  INTERESTS  IN THE CORPORATION. Holders of
 voting trust certificates representing shares of the  corporation  shall
 be  regarded  as shareholders for the purpose of this section.  Any such
 agent or attorney shall be authorized in a writing  that  satisfies  the
 requirements  of a writing under paragraph (b) of section 609 (Proxies).
 A corporation requested to provide information pursuant  to  this  para-
 graph  shall  make available such information in written form and in any
 other format in which such information is maintained by the  corporation
 and  shall  not  be  required  to  provide such information in any other
 format. If a request made pursuant to this paragraph includes a  request
 to  furnish  information  regarding  beneficial  owners, the corporation
 shall make available such information in its possession regarding  bene-
 ficial  owners  as is provided to the corporation by a registered broker
 or dealer or a bank, association or other entity that exercises  fiduci-
 ary  powers  in  connection  with  the forwarding of information to such
 owners. The corporation shall not  be  required  to  obtain  information

 § 630. Liability  of shareholders for wages due to laborers, servants or
  employees.
  (a) The ten largest shareholders, as determined by the fair  value  of
 their beneficial interest as of the beginning of the period during which
 the  unpaid services referred to in this section are performed, of every
 domestic corporation or of any  foreign  corporation,  when  the  unpaid
 services were performed in the state, no shares of which are listed on a
 national  securities exchange or regularly quoted in an over-the-counter
 market by one or more members of a national or an affiliated  securities
 association,  shall  jointly  and severally be personally liable for all
 S. 7539  4
 
 debts, wages or salaries due and owing to any of its laborers,  servants
 or  employees other than contractors, for services performed by them for
 such corporation. [Before such laborer, servant or employee shall charge
 such  shareholder  for such services, he shall give notice in writing to
 such shareholder that he intends to hold him liable under this  section.
 Such  notice  shall  be  given  within one hundred and eighty days after
 termination of such services, except that if, within  such  period,  the
 laborer,  servant  or  employee  demands an examination of the record of
 shareholders under paragraph (b) of  section  624  (Books  and  records;
 right  of inspection, prima facie evidence) of this article, such notice
 may be given within sixty days after he has been given  the  opportunity
 to examine the record of shareholders. An action to enforce such liabil-
 ity  shall  be  commenced  within  ninety  days  after  the return of an
 execution unsatisfied against the corporation upon a judgment  recovered
 against  it  for  such services.] The provisions of this paragraph shall
 not apply to an investment company registered as such under  an  act  of
 congress entitled "Investment Company Act of 1940."
  (b) For the purposes of this section, wages or salaries shall mean all
 compensation  and  benefits payable by an employer to or for the account
 of the employee for personal services rendered by such employee  INCLUD-
 ING  ANY CONCOMITANT LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, PENALTIES, INTEREST, ATTORNEY'S
 FEES OR COSTS.  These shall specifically include but not be  limited  to
 salaries,  overtime,  vacation,  holiday  and  severance  pay;  employer
 contributions to or payments of insurance or welfare benefits;  employer
 contributions to pension or annuity funds; and any other moneys properly
 due or payable for services rendered by such employee.
  (c)  A  shareholder  who  has paid more than his OR HER pro rata share
 under this section shall be entitled to contribution pro rata  from  the
 other  shareholders liable under this section with respect to the excess
 so paid, over and above his OR HER pro rata  share,  and  may  sue  them
 jointly  or  severally  or  any number of them to recover the amount due
 from them.  Such recovery may be had in a separate action.  As  used  in
 this  paragraph,  "pro  rata"  means  in  proportion to beneficial share
 interest. Before a shareholder may claim contribution from other  share-
 holders  under  this  paragraph, he OR SHE shall[, unless they have been
 given notice by a laborer, servant or  employee  under  paragraph  (a),]
 give  them  notice  in  writing  that  he OR SHE intends to hold them so
 liable to him OR HER. Such notice shall be given by him  OR  HER  within

 limited liability company, or of any foreign limited liability  company,
 when  the unpaid services were performed in the state, shall jointly and
 severally be personally liable for all debts, wages or salaries due  and
 owing  to  any  of  its  laborers,  servants  or employees, for services
 performed by them for  such  limited  liability  company.  [Before  such
 laborer, servant or employee shall charge such member for such services,
 he  or  she  shall  give notice in writing to such member that he or she
 intends to hold such member liable under this section. Such notice shall
 S. 7539  5

 be given within one  hundred  eighty  days  after  termination  of  such
 services.  An action to enforce such liability shall be commenced within
 ninety days after the return of an  execution  unsatisfied  against  the
 limited  liability company upon a judgment recovered against it for such
 services.] A member who has paid more than his or  her  pro  rata  share
 under  this  section shall be entitled to contribution pro rata from the
 other members liable under this section with respect to  the  excess  so
 paid, over and above his or her pro rata share, and may sue them jointly
 or  severally or any number of them to recover the amount due from them.
 Such recovery may be had in a separate action. As used in this  subdivi-
 sion,  "pro  rata" means in proportion to percentage ownership interest.
 Before a member may claim contribution from  other  members  under  this
 section,  he  or  she  shall  give them notice in writing that he or she
 intends to hold them so liable to him or her.
