  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  citizens of the great State of New York honored this
country by serving valiantly in the United States Armed Forces and their
reserve components; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this State can never forget the courageousness
with which these servicemen and  women  fought  and  provided  essential
services on battlefields, in jungles, in the air, and at sea; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud of its commitment to
those in the military who served in the time of active conflict  and  in
times of peace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  2023,  as  Military  Appreciation
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Military Appreciation Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Military  Appreciation  Month,  designated  by
Congress,  provides  a  period  of  encompassing  both  the  history and
recognition of our armed forces with an in-depth look at  the  diversity
of its individuals and achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Military Appreciation Month allows New Yorkers to
educate each generation of the historical impact of our military through
the participation of the community with  those  who  serve,  encouraging
patriotism and love of America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  month  of  May  gives the Nation and State a forum, a
framework, a time, and place on which to focus, to  draw  attention  and
express our gratitude to our armed forces and to recall our history; and
 
  WHEREAS, May 2023, National Military Appreciation Month, includes VE
Day,  Military  Spouse  Appreciation Day, Loyalty Day, Armed Forces Day,
Public Service Recognition Week, and Memorial Day; this important month,
therefore, honors these Americans who have given their lives in  service
to our great nation and the men and women now serving in uniform; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Military  Appreciation Month recognizes those on
active duty  in  all  branches  of  services,  the  National  Guard  and
Reserves,  military  retirees,  veterans,  and  all their families; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
most gratefully acknowledge the servicemen and women, veterans, military
retirees  and  all  their families and respectfully memorialize Governor
Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Military Appreciation Month in the

  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitable  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
