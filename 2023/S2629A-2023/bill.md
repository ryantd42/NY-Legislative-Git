 ities conducted by state supported contractors.

 intervention  services,  and  coordinate  appropriate funding sources to
 ensure the efficient delivery of services.  Such  comprehensive  school-
 based intervention models shall also include provisions for the involve-
 ment  of teachers, parents, school administrators in the development and
