  9. (A) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL TAKE ALL STEPS NECESSARY TO ENROLL  INTO
 THE  MEDICAL  ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PERSONS PROGRAM UNDER TITLE ELEVEN OF
 ARTICLE FIVE OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW ANY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL  COMMIT-
 TED  TO  THE CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT, UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES
 THAT SUCH APPLICATION IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL WAS ENROLLED

 SHALL BE PROVIDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL.
  (B) WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS FOUND INELIGIBLE FOR THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
 PROGRAM, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL MAKE DILIGENT EFFORTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER
 THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR ANY OTHER MEDICAL INSURANCE PROGRAM  AND,
 IF  SO,  ASSIST THE INDIVIDUAL IN APPLYING TO THE PROGRAM FOR WHICH THEY
 ARE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WISH TO ENROLL IN SUCH PROGRAM.

 INTENDENT OF SUCH FACILITY SHALL TAKE ALL STEPS NECESSARY FOR ENROLLMENT
 INTO THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PERSONS PROGRAM UNDER TITLE ELEVEN

 PROVIDED DURING SUCH TIME  AS  THE  PERSON  IS  INCARCERATED  EXCEPT  AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE-A OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX OF

 THIS SUBDIVISION, ANY DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ENROLLMENT SHALL BE KEPT  IN

 WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WISH TO ENROLL IN SUCH PROGRAM.
  § 3. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 of section  366-a  of  the  social
 services  law,  as amended by chapter 41 of the laws of 1992, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (b) notify the applicant in writing of the decision,  and  where  such
 applicant  is  found eligible, provide a tamper resistant identification
 card containing a photo image of  the  applicant  for  use  in  securing
 medical assistance under this title provided, however, that an identifi-
 cation  card  need  not  contain a photo image of a person other than an
 adult member of an eligible household or a single-person eligible house-
 hold. The department is not required to provide, but shall seek  practi-
 cal  methods  for  providing,  a card with such picture to a person when
 such person is homebound or is a resident of a residential  health  care
 facility,  or  an  in-patient  psychiatric  facility,  or is expected to
 remain hospitalized for an extended period.  WHERE  THE  APPLICANT  IS
 INCARCERATED  BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION
 OR IN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AS DEFINED IN  SECTION  TWO  OF  THE
 CORRECTION  LAW, THE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICIAL OR THE DEPART-
 MENT OF HEALTH OR ITS AGENT SHALL PROVIDE SUCH  IDENTIFICATION  CARD  TO
 THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR LOCAL CORREC-
 TIONAL  FACILITY  FOR KEEPING WITH THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S RECORDS
 UNTIL SUCH INDIVIDUAL IS  RELEASED.  The  commissioner  shall  have  the
 authority  to  define  categories  of recipients who are not required to
 have a photo identification card  where  such  card  would  be  limited,
 unnecessary or impracticable.

  (III) RELEASED WITH PROOF OF ENROLLMENT IN SUCH PROGRAMS; AND
  (IV) RELEASED WITHOUT PROOF OF ENROLLMENT IN SUCH PROGRAMS.
