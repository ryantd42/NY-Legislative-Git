 THE NAIC GROUP SUPERVISION APPROACH, AS DETAILED IN THE  NAIC  FINANCIAL
 ANALYSIS HANDBOOK; AND
  (II)  HAS  A  NON-UNITED STATES GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISOR THAT IS NOT IN A

 SUBSECTION, WHEN THIS STATE IS THE LEAD STATE, THE SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL
 REQUIRE  THE  GROUP  CAPITAL CALCULATION FOR UNITED STATES OPERATIONS OF

 LATION AT THE NEXT ANNUAL FILING DATE UNLESS GIVEN AN EXTENSION  BY  THE
 SUPERINTENDENT BASED ON REASONABLE GROUNDS SHOWN.
  (D)(1)  AN  ULTIMATE  HOLDING COMPANY THAT  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY
 CONTROLS  AN INSURER SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION AND THAT IS SCOPED INTO THE
 NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK SHALL FILE THE RESULTS OF A SPECIF-
 IC YEAR'S ANNUAL LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT WHEN THIS
 S. 7095  4

 STATE,  AN  ULTIMATE  HOLDING COMPANY SHALL FILE WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT
 THE RESULTS OF A SPECIFIC YEAR'S LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST IF  THE  ULTIMATE
 HOLDING  COMPANY  HAS  NOT FILED THE RESULTS WITH THE LEAD STATE BECAUSE
 THE LEAD STATE HAS NOT ENACTED A LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST  FILING  REQUIRE-
 MENT OR THE ULTIMATE HOLDING COMPANY HAS FILED THE RESULTS WITH THE LEAD
 STATE  BUT  THE  LEAD  STATE IS NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO SHARE THE RESULTS
 WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT.  THE PERFORMANCE OF, AND FILING OF THE  RESULTS

 NOT  TRIGGER  AT  LEAST  ONE  THRESHOLD  OF  THE SCOPE CRITERIA SHALL BE
 CONSIDERED SCOPED OUT OF THE NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS  TEST  FRAMEWORK  FOR
 THE SPECIFIED DATA YEAR, UNLESS THE SUPERINTENDENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH
 THE  NAIC  FINANCIAL  STABILITY TASK FORCE, OR ITS SUCCESSOR, DETERMINES
 THE INSURER SHALL BE SCOPED INTO THE NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS  TEST  FRAME-
 WORK  FOR  THAT  DATA YEAR. THE SUPERINTENDENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE
 NAIC FINANCIAL STABILITY TASK FORCE, OR ITS SUCCESSOR, SHALL ASSESS  THE
 CONCERN  OF  WISHING  TO  AVOID HAVING INSURERS SCOPED IN AND OUT OF THE
 NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK ON A FREQUENT BASIS AS PART OF  THE
 DETERMINATION FOR AN INSURER.
  (E)  NO  INSURER,  INSURANCE  PRODUCER,  OR  OTHER  PERSON SHALL MAKE,

 HOWEVER,  THAT  AN  INSURER MAY PUBLISH, WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT'S PRIOR
 APPROVAL, AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN A WRITTEN PUBLICATION TO  REBUT  ANY  MATE-
 RIALLY  FALSE  STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING IF THE INSURER IS
 ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT  WITH  SUBSTANTIAL  PROOF  THE
 FALSITY  OF SUCH STATEMENT OR INAPPROPRIATENESS, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND
 IF THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO REBUT THE MATERIALLY FALSE
 STATEMENT.

 ATE IN THAT JURISDICTION.

 PLACE.
  (3) NOTWITHSTANDING THE  EXEMPTIONS  FROM  FILING  THE  GROUP  CAPITAL
 CALCULATION  SET  FORTH  IN  PARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS SUBSECTION, WHEN THIS
 STATE IS THE LEAD STATE, THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS THE DISCRETION TO EXEMPT
 A  PARENT  CORPORATION FROM FILING  AN  ANNUAL GROUP CAPITAL CALCULATION

 MEETING AT LEAST ONE THRESHOLD OF THE SCOPE CRITERIA SHALL BE CONSIDERED
 SCOPED INTO THE NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK FOR  THE  SPECIFIED
 DATA  YEAR  UNLESS  THE  SUPERINTENDENT,  IN  CONSULTATION WITH THE NAIC

 NOT TRIGGER AT LEAST ONE  THRESHOLD  OF  THE  SCOPE  CRITERIA  SHALL  BE
 CONSIDERED  SCOPED  OUT  OF THE NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK FOR
 THE SPECIFIED DATA YEAR, UNLESS THE SUPERINTENDENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH
 THE NAIC FINANCIAL STABILITY TASK FORCE, OR  ITS  SUCCESSOR,  DETERMINES
 THE  INSURER  SHALL BE SCOPED INTO THE NAIC LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAME-
 WORK FOR THAT DATA YEAR. THE SUPERINTENDENT, IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  THE
 NAIC  FINANCIAL STABILITY TASK FORCE, OR ITS SUCCESSOR, SHALL ASSESS THE
 CONCERN OF WISHING TO AVOID HAVING INSURERS SCOPED IN  AND  OUT  OF  THE
 NAIC  LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK ON A FREQUENT BASIS AS PART OF THE

 MENT CONTAINING A REPRESENTATION OR STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO  THE  GROUP
 CAPITAL  CALCULATION,  GROUP CAPITAL  RATIO,  LIQUIDITY  STRESS  TEST
 RESULTS OR SUPPORTING  DISCLOSURES  FOR  SUCH TEST, OR  ANY  COMPONENT
 DERIVED  IN  THE  CALCULATION  THEREOF,  OF  ANY PARENT CORPORATION  OR
 SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  A PARENT CORPORATION  MAY
 PUBLISH,  WITH  THE  SUPERINTENDENT'S PRIOR APPROVAL, ANNOUNCEMENTS IN A
 WRITTEN PUBLICATION TO REBUT ANY MATERIALLY FALSE STATEMENT WITH RESPECT
 TO THE FOREGOING IF THE INSURER IS ABLE TO  DEMONSTRATE  TO  THE  SUPER-
 INTENDENT  WITH  SUBSTANTIAL  PROOF THE FALSITY OF SUCH STATEMENT OR THE
 INAPPROPRIATENESS, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND IF THE SOLE  PURPOSE  OF  THE
 ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO REBUT THE MATERIALLY FALSE STATEMENT.

 VISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS, INCLUDING THE ENGAGE-
 MENT  OF  ATTORNEYS,  ACTUARIES,  AND  ANY  OTHER  PROFESSIONALS AND ALL
