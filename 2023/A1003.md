 (a) Each nonjudicial officer and employee of the unified court system in

 ance with this section if he or she (i) is not in any collective negoti-
 ating unit established pursuant to article 14 of the civil service  law,
 or  (ii) is in a collective negotiating unit of nonjudicial officers and
 employees of the unified court system specified in section one  of  this
 act.  Increases  to  basic  annual  salary, as provided in this section,
 shall be prorated for any nonjudicial officer or employee whose position
 is part-time, or who otherwise works part-time,  and  who  is  eligible,
 under  the rules of the chief judge of the state or an agreement between
 the state and an employee organization pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 article  14  of  the  civil service law, to accrue annual and sick leave
 credits. For purposes of this section:
  (1) no nonjudicial officer or employee shall receive a full or partial
 increment hereunder unless he or she shall have received other  than  an
 unsatisfactory  performance  rating  for  his or her services during the
 year immediately preceding pursuant to a performance  evaluation  system
 set  forth  by  the  chief administrator or in an agreement specified in
 section one of this act, nor shall any nonjudicial officer  or  employee
 receive a bonus provided in this section where he or she, as of the date
 on  which this act becomes a law, already has received that bonus pursu-
 ant to law other than a provision of this act;
  (2) any full or partial increment received by a nonjudicial officer or
 employee effective April 1, 2021 or April 1, 2022, pursuant to law other
 than a provision of this act, shall not be considered when  determining:

 fied date; and (ii) whether a nonjudicial officer or employee is  eligi-
 ble  to  receive  a full or partial increment of the grade of his or her
 position on any of such dates pursuant to a provision of this act; and
  (3) service in the employ of  the  unified  court  system  shall  mean
 service in one or more courts or agencies thereof, whether as a judge or
 a nonjudicial officer or employee. In order for a nonjudicial officer or
 employee's years of service in the employ of the unified court system to
 be  "continuous," he or she must have served the equivalent of 120 week-
 days in each of those years; and the number of years required to qualify
 for a bonus hereunder must be served consecutively except that they  may
 be  interrupted  by  one  or more breaks of not more than one year each,
 attributable to a period of time between any separation from his or  her
 position  in  the  employ  of the unified court system and resumption of
 service in such employ.
  (b) Effective April 1, 2021:
  (1) Each such nonjudicial officer and  employee  who  is  eligible  to
 receive  a full or partial increment of the grade of his or her position

 certificate  that  there  is  in effect with respect to such negotiating
 unit a written collective bargaining agreement with the  state  pursuant
 to  article 14 of the civil service law which provides therefor; and any

 increments  or  partial  increments,  bonuses,  or payments, provided by

 law:
 A. 1003  14

  (a)  may  be withheld in whole or in part from any nonjudicial officer
 and employee not in a collective negotiating unit  established  pursuant

 shall be added to the salary or compensation of such officer or employee
 at the beginning of the payroll period the first day of which is nearest
 to  the  effective  date  of  such  increase  as  provided  in this act;
 provided, however, for the purposes of determining the  salary  of  such
 officer  or  employee  upon reclassification, reallocation, appointment,
 promotion, transfer, demotion, reinstatement or other change of  status,
 such salary increase shall be deemed to be effective on the date thereof
 as  prescribed  in  this  act,  and the payment thereof pursuant to this
 section on the date prior thereto instead of  on  such  effective  date,
 shall  not operate to confer any additional salary rights or benefits on
 such officer or employee.
  §  11.  Deferred  payment  of  salary  increase.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions  of  this act or any other law, commencing April 1, 2021, and

 tion subject to this act at any time during the  period  from  April  1,
 2021  until  the time when basic annual salaries are first paid pursuant
 to this act for such service in  excess  of  the  compensation  actually
 received  therefor  shall  be  entitled  to  a  lump sum payment for the
 difference between the salary to which such incumbent  is  entitled  for
