  RECOGNIZING  the  observance of World AIDS Day, on
  December 1, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is  moved  to  recognize
the observance of World AIDS Day, Friday, December 1, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  AIDS Day, observed on December 1 every year, brings
together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS;
since 1995, the President of the United  States  has  made  an  official
proclamation on World AIDS Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  AIDS  Day  is an opportunity for public and private
partners to spread awareness  about  the  status  of  the  pandemic  and
encourage  progress  in  HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in high
prevalence countries and around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Initiated by the United Nations, and first  held  in  1988,
World  AIDS  Day  was  the  first  ever  declared  global  health  day;
commemorating  the  day  presents  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate
international solidarity in the face of the pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  HIV/AIDS  continues  to  be  a  major global public health
issue; the disease claimed more than 25  million  lives  over  the  past
three  decades,  making  it  one  of  the  most destructive epidemics in
recorded history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Worldwide there were approximately 34 million people living
with HIV in 2011; sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected  region,  with
nearly 1 in every 20 adults living with HIV; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  HIV/AIDS  pandemic  affects  New York State; in 2008,
there were  a  reported  187,738  cases  of  AIDS,  and  another  48,266
individuals were living with HIV; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  AIDS  Institute,  over  55,000 African
Americans live with HIV/AIDS in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The World AIDS Campaign focus on "Zero AIDS related deaths"
signifies a push towards greater access to treatment for all; a call for
communities and governments to act now; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is no cure  for  HIV  infection;  however,  effective
treatment with antiretroviral drugs can control the virus so that people
with HIV can enjoy healthy and productive lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is crucial that days such as World AIDS Day are observed
in  order  to continue raising awareness and eventually, terminating the
 
spread of HIV/AIDS, not only in the State of New York,  but  around  the
world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize the observance of World AIDS Day on December 1, 2023.
