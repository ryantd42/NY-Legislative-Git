 AND, IF APPROPRIATE, TO ELECT A SUCCESSOR SHALL BE CALLED BY THE  GOVER-
 NOR AND HELD NOT LESS THAN SIXTY DAYS NOR MORE THAN EIGHTY DAYS FROM THE

  2.  A  RECALL ELECTION MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS

 VOTE AT THAT NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED  ELECTION  EQUAL  AT  LEAST  FIFTY
 PERCENT OF ALL THE VOTERS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AT THE RECALL ELECTION.
  3.  IF  THE  MAJORITY  VOTE ON THE QUESTION IS TO RECALL, THE DISTRICT
 ATTORNEY IS REMOVED AND, IF THERE IS  A  CANDIDATE,  THE  CANDIDATE  WHO
 RECEIVES  A PLURALITY IS THE SUCCESSOR. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MAY NOT BE
 A CANDIDATE.
  § 4. A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO IS NOT RECALLED SHALL  BE  REIMBURSED  BY
 THE  STATE  FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S RECALL ELECTION EXPENSES LEGALLY
