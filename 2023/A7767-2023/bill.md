 sation for the hours actually worked.

 standing the provisions of this act or of any other law, the increase in
 salary or compensation of any officer or employee provided by  this  act
 shall be added to the salary or compensation of such officer or employee
 at  the beginning of that payroll period the first day of which is near-
 est to the effective date of such increase as provided in this  act,  or
 at the beginning of the earlier of two payroll periods the first days of
 which  are  nearest  but  equally  near  to  the  effective date of such
 increase as provided in  this  act,  provided,  however,  that  for  the
 purposes  of  determining  the  salary or hourly rate of such officer or
 employee upon reclassification,  reallocation,  appointment,  promotion,
 transfer, demotion, reinstatement or other change of status, such salary
 or  hourly  rate  increase  shall  be deemed to be effective on the date
 thereof as prescribed in this act, and the payment thereof  pursuant  to
 this section on a date prior thereto, instead of on such effective date,

 the  rate  of  compensation  otherwise payable in their respective posi-
 tions. An incumbent holding a position subject to this act at  any  time
 during  the period from the effective dates of the salary or hourly rate
 increases provided for in this act until  the  time  when  basic  annual
 salaries  or  compensation  are first paid pursuant to this act for such
 services in excess of the compensation actually received therefor, shall
 be entitled to a lump sum payment for the difference between the  salary
 to  which  such  incumbent is entitled for such services and the compen-
 sation actually received therefor. Such lump sum payments shall be  made
 as  soon as practicable. For the purpose of calculating retirement bene-
 fits, the amounts paid under this act shall count as compensation earned
 during the year or years for which it is calculated and not  as  compen-
 sation  earned  wholly in the year in which it is paid.  Notwithstanding
 any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, no member  of  the  profes-
 A. 7767  12
 
 sional  services  unit to whom the provisions of this act apply shall be
 entitled to, or owed, any interest or other penalty for  any  reason  on
 any  monies due to such member pursuant to the terms of this act and the
 terms  of  the agreement covering employees in the professional services
 unit.
  § 15. Use of appropriations. The comptroller is authorized to pay  any

 provisions  of  this  act  for  any  state department or agency from any
 appropriation or other funds available to such state department or agen-
 cy for personal service or for other related  employee  benefits  during
 such  fiscal  year.  To the extent that such appropriations are insuffi-
 cient in any fund to accomplish  the  purposes  herein  set  forth,  the
 director  of the budget is authorized to allocate to the various depart-
 ments and agencies, from any appropriations available in any  fund,  the
 amounts necessary to pay such amounts. The aforementioned appropriations
 shall  be  available  for  payment  of  any  liabilities  or obligations
 incurred prior to April 1, 2023 in addition to current liabilities.
  § 16. Payment from special or administrative  funds.  If  the  compen-
 sation  to which officers and employees of the state are otherwise enti-
 tled is payable from a special or administrative fund or  funds  of  the
 state,  other  than the general fund or the capital projects fund of the
 state, the increase in compensation to which such officers or  employees
 are  entitled  under  this  act shall be payable from such other fund or
 funds in the same manner as such  other  compensation.  If  the  amounts
 appropriated or allocable from such other fund or funds are insufficient
 to  accomplish  the  purposes of this act, the director of the budget is
 hereby authorized to allocate such additional sums from such other  fund
 or funds as may be necessary therefor.
  §  17. Effect of participation in special annuity program. No employee
 participating in a special annuity program pursuant to the provisions of
 article 8-C of title 1 of the education  law  shall,  by  reason  of  an
 increase  in  compensation pursuant to this act, suffer any reduction of
 the salary adjustment to which such officer or employee would  otherwise
 be  entitled by reason of participation in such program, and such salary
 adjustment shall be based upon the salary of such  officer  or  employee
 without regard to the reduction authorized by said article.

 priated  in the general fund/state purposes account (10050) in miscella-
 neous-all  state  departments  and  agencies  solely  for
 apportionment/transfer  by  the  director  of  the budget for use by any
 state department or agency, including the contract  colleges  at  Alfred
 and Cornell, in any fund for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2023, to
 supplement  appropriations  available  for  personal service, other than
 personal service, and fringe benefits, and to carry out  the  provisions
 of  this  act.  No  money  shall  be available for expenditure from this
 appropriation until a certificate of approval has  been  issued  by  the
 director  of  the budget and a copy of such certificate or any amendment
 thereto has been filed with the state  comptroller,  the  chair  of  the
 senate  finance  committee  and the chair of the assembly ways and means
 committee. The monies hereby appropriated are available for  payment  of
 any  liabilities or obligations incurred prior to April 1, 2023 in addi-
 tion to liabilities or  obligations  associated  with  the  fiscal  year
