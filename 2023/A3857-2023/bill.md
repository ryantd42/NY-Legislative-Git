  § 904. Examinations by health appraisal. 1. Each principal of a public

 health services having jurisdiction over such school, the names  of  all

 this chapter[, and the].
  A. THE director of school health services shall cause such students to
 be separately and carefully examined and tested to ascertain whether any
 student has defective sight or hearing, or any other physical disability
 which  may tend to prevent him or her from receiving the full benefit of
 school work, or from requiring a modification of such  work  to  prevent
 injury  to  the  student or from receiving the best educational results.
 Each examination shall also include a calculation of the student's  body
 mass  index  (BMI)  and  weight  status  category.  For purposes of this
 section, BMI is computed as the  weight  in  kilograms  divided  by  the
 square of height in meters or the weight in pounds divided by the square
 of  height  in  inches  multiplied by a conversion factor of 703. Weight
 status categories for children and adolescents shall be  as  defined  by
 the  commissioner  of  health.  In all school districts, such physician,
 physician assistant or nurse  practitioner  shall  determine  whether  a
 one-time test for sickle cell anemia is necessary or desirable and he or
 she  shall  conduct  such  tests  and  the  certificate  shall state the
 results. If it should be ascertained, upon  such  test  or  examination,
 that  any  of  such  students  have defective sight or hearing, or other
 physical disability, including sickle cell anemia, as  above  described,
 the  principal  or  his  or her designee shall notify the parents of, or
 other persons in parental relation to, the child as to the existence  of
 such  disability.  If  the parents or other persons in parental relation
 are unable or unwilling to provide the necessary  relief  and  treatment
 for  such  students, such fact shall be reported by the principal or his
 or her designee to the director of school health services, whose duty it
 shall be to provide relief for such students.  Each  school  and  school
 district  chosen  as  part  of an appropriate sampling methodology shall
 participate in surveys directed by the commissioner of  health  pursuant
 to  the public health law in relation to students' BMI and weight status
 categories as determined by the examination conducted pursuant  to  this
 section  and  which  shall  be  subject  to audit by the commissioner of
 health. Such surveys shall contain the information required pursuant  to
 this  subdivision in relation to students' BMI and weight status catego-
 ries in aggregate. Parents or other persons in parental  relation  to  a
 student  may refuse to have the student's BMI and weight status category
 included in such survey. Each school and school district  shall  provide
 the  commissioner of health with any information, records and reports he
 or she may require for the purpose of such audit.  The  BMI  and  weight
 status  survey and audit as described in this section shall be conducted
 consistent with confidentiality requirements  imposed  by  federal  law.
 Data  collection for such surveys shall commence on a voluntary basis at
 the beginning of the two thousand seven academic school year, and by all
 schools chosen as part of the sampling methodology at the  beginning  of
 the  two  thousand eight academic school year. The department shall also
