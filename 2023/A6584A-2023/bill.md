 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  GALLAGHER  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  requiring  applicants  for  major  projects located near disadvantaged
  communities to submit an enhanced public participation plan

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The environmental conservation law is amended by adding a
 new article 59 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 59
  DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES
 SECTION 59-0101. DECLARATION OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  59-0103. DEFINITIONS.
  59-0105. ENHANCED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PLAN.
  59-0107. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT.
  59-0109. APPLICANT CERTIFICATION.
  59-0111. PROHIBITIONS.
 § 59-0101. DECLARATION OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THAT IT IS  THE  POLICY  OF  THE
 STATE OF NEW YORK TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND INCORPORATE MEAS-
 URES  FOR  ACHIEVING  ENVIRONMENTAL  JUSTICE  INTO THE STATE'S PROGRAMS,
 POLICIES, REGULATIONS, LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND ACTIVITIES. THE  LEGIS-
 LATURE  FURTHER  FINDS  AND  DECLARES  THAT  ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AND
 MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE HAVE LONG BORNE A DISPROPORTIONATE AND
 INEQUITABLE POLLUTION BURDEN, CAUSED BY HISTORIC SITING  OF  SOURCES  OF
 POLLUTION IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.
  2.  MANY ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE
 SUFFER FROM ELEVATED RATES OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES,  INCLUDING  ASTHMA,
 BRONCHITIS,  AND  EMPHYSEMA, AND OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED
 WITH THE LONG-TERM AND CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POLLUTION
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6584  2
 
 RESULTING FROM THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND INEQUITABLE SITING OF  POLLUTION
 SOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.
  3. THE INTERSECTION OF HIGH ASTHMA RATES, ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, AND
 DISADVANTAGED  COMMUNITIES  IS  PREVALENT  IN  NEW  YORK  CITY'S "ASTHMA
 ALLEY," WHICH COMPRISES PARTS OF QUEENS, THE  BRONX,  AND  BROOKLYN.  IN
 ASTORIA, QUEENS, TWO GENERATING STATIONS PROVIDE NEARLY HALF OF NEW YORK
 CITY'S  ELECTRICITY. THIS AREA EXPERIENCES ASTHMA RATES GREATER THAN THE
 BOROUGH AVERAGE.
  4. THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND INEQUITABLE SITING OF POLLUTION SOURCES IN
 ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES IS IN  LARGE  PART  THE
 RESULT  OF INADEQUATE NOTICE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES OF THE PROPOSED SITING
 OF THOSE SOURCES AND INADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR  COMMUNITY  INPUT  AND
 PARTICIPATION DURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT PROCESS.
  5.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY FINDS IT IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH
 AND SAFETY TO REQUIRE MAJOR PROJECTS LOCATED IN OR ADJACENT TO DISADVAN-
 TAGED COMMUNITIES TO UNDERGO REVIEW AND TO COMPLY WITH  ENHANCED  NOTICE
 AND  PUBLIC  PARTICIPATION  REQUIREMENTS.  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS
 THAT ENHANCED NOTICE AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS FOR DISADVAN-
 TAGED COMMUNITIES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PURPOSES, INTENT  AND  REQUIRE-
 MENTS  OF THE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT. IT IS THE
 INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE  THAT  ECONOMICALLY  DISTRESSED  AND  MINORITY
 COMMUNITIES  BE  PROVIDED  WITH ENHANCED NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROJECTS AND
 ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR INPUT AND PARTICIPATION DURING  THE  ENVIRON-
 MENTAL  PERMIT PROCESS SO THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A GREATER VOICE IN
 THE SITING OF NEW OR EXPANDED SOURCES OF POLLUTION.
