  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 17, 2023, as Dyslexia Awareness Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that the State  of
New  York is committed to equal educational opportunities by identifying
obstacles  to  educational  advancement  and  helping  to  remove  those
obstacles; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dyslexia, which often runs in families, is a language-based
learning  disability  that  is  neurobiological in origin and interferes
with language  processing,  accurate  and/or  fluent  word  recognition,
spelling  and  decoding  abilities  and  reading  comprehension  despite
average or above average intelligence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dyslexia varies in severity ranging from mild  to  profound
and  is characterized by a combination of difficulties with phonological
and orthographic processing leading to difficulties in reading, writing,
spelling, handwriting and/or math which can create a wide gap between an
individual's intellectual ability and  their  academic  and/or  personal
achievement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dyslexia  is identifiable as early as 4-6 years of age and
early intervention is beneficial as the negative consequences are highly
preventable through effective, direct instruction in the five pillars of
reading identified in 2000 by the National Reading Panel of the National
Academy  of  Sciences,  namely  phonemic  awareness,  phonics,  fluency,
vocabulary and comprehension; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dyslexia  can  affect  anyone, regardless of race, gender,
culture or socioeconomic status and impacts up to 20% of the population;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Imparting to our children literacy skills built on the five
pillars of reading  can  ensure  that  the  benefits  of  good  literacy
instruction  will  accrue  to improved educational and life outcomes for
New York's children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Literacy skills for everyone is an important goal  for  the
State  of New York and because dyslexia affects a high percentage of our
struggling readers, it is important that we recognize and  address  this
issue  head on so that each person in New York has the opportunity to be
able to  learn,  read  and  spell  proficiently  and  reach  their  full
potential; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 17, 2023, as  Dyslexia
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York
