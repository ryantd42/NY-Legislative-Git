  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 2 of article 19 of  the  constitution,
  in relation to the election of delegates

  Section  1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 2 of arti-
 cle 19 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 2. At the general election to be held in the year  nineteen  hundred
 fifty-seven, and every twentieth year thereafter, and also at such times
 as  the  legislature  may by law provide, the question "Shall there be a
 convention to revise the constitution and  amend  the  same?"  shall  be
 submitted  to  and  decided  by the electors of the state; and in case a
 majority of the electors voting thereon  shall  decide  in  favor  of  a
 convention  for  such  purpose, the electors of every senate district of
 the state, as then organized, shall elect three delegates  at  the  next
 ensuing  general  election,  and the electors of the state voting at the
 same election shall elect fifteen delegates-at-large.  NO PERSON  ACTING
 AS  A  POLITICAL  PARTY CHAIRPERSON, AN ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICER, A PERSON
 APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE  LOBBYING
 RULES  ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC INTEGRITY, ANY PERSON WHO
 IS REQUIRED TO FILE AN ANNUAL STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE WITH THE

 AN ORGANIZATION, ASSOCIATION OR CORPORATION, OTHER THAN AN ENTITY DESIG-
 NATED  AS TAX EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 501(C)(3) OF THE UNITED STATES INTER-

 TARY. The delegates so elected shall convene at the capitol on the first
 Tuesday of April next ensuing after their election, and  shall  continue

 assembly  and  be  reimbursed  for  actual traveling expenses, while the
 convention is in session, to the extent that a member  of  the  assembly
 would  then be entitled thereto in the case of a session of the legisla-
 ture.  A  majority  of  the convention shall constitute a quorum for the
 transaction of business, and no amendment to the constitution  shall  be
 submitted  for  approval to the electors as hereinafter provided, unless
 by the assent of a majority of all the delegates elected to the  conven-
 tion,  the  ayes  and  noes being entered on the journal to be kept. The
 convention shall have the power to appoint such officers, employees  and
 assistants  as  it may deem necessary, and fix their compensation and to
 provide for the printing of  its  documents,  journal,  proceedings  and
 other  expenses  of  said convention. The convention shall determine the
 rules of its own proceedings, choose its own officers, and be the  judge
 of the election, returns and qualifications of its members. In case of a
 vacancy,  by death, resignation or other cause, of any district delegate
 elected to the convention, such vacancy shall be filled by a vote of the
 remaining delegates representing the  district  in  which  such  vacancy
 occurs.  If  such  vacancy  occurs in the office of a delegate-at-large,
 such vacancy shall be filled by a vote of  the  remaining  delegates-at-
 large. Any proposed constitution or constitutional amendment which shall
 have  been  adopted  by such convention, shall be submitted to a vote of
 the electors of the state at the time and in the manner provided by such
 convention, at an election which shall be held not less than  six  weeks
 after  the  adjournment  of  such  convention. Upon the approval of such
 constitution or constitutional amendments, in the manner provided in the
 last preceding section, such constitution or  constitutional  amendment,
 shall  go  into  effect  on  the  first  day  of January next after such
 approval.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the  foregoing  amendment
 be referred to the first regular legislative session convening after the
 next  succeeding  general  election  of members of the assembly, and, in
 conformity with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution,  be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
