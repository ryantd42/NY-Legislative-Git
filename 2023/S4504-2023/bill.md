 FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF NOISE EXPOSURE MAPS (NEMS) AND NOISE COMPATIBILITY
 PROGRAMS (NCPS).
  §  1389-II. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE, THE FOLLOWING
 DEFINITIONS SHALL APPLY:
  1. "COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL" (CNEL) MEANS, IN  DECIBELS,  THE
 AVERAGE  DAYTIME  NOISE LEVEL DURING A TWENTY-FOUR HOUR PERIOD, ADJUSTED
 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOWER TOLERANCE OF NOISE DURING EVENING AND NIGHTTIME
 PERIODS IN RELATION TO DAYTIME PERIODS.
  2. "HOURLY NOISE LEVEL DAYTIME" (HNLD) MEANS, IN DECIBELS, THE  HOURLY
 NOISE LEVELS FOR THE HOURS OF 0700-1900.
  3.  "HOURLY NOISE LEVEL EVENING" (HNLE) MEANS, IN DECIBELS, THE HOURLY

 (NCPS).
  2.  THE COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL) SHALL BE CALCULATED BY
 THE FOLLOWING: CNEL = 10 LOG  (1/24)  ({SIGMA}  ANTILOG  (HNLD/10)  +  3
 {SIGMA} ANTILOG (HNLE/10) + 10 {SIGMA} ANTILOG (HNLN/10)).
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
