  Memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June
  2023, as Black Music Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
seek  to  preserve  and  celebrate the musical heritage of our State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Black  Music
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National African-American Music Appreciation Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, African-American Music  Appreciation  Month  is  an  annual
celebration of African-American music in the United States, commemorated
with  special  performances  and  multi-day  festivals in musical genres
ranging from soul to jazz to gospel to hip-hop  throughout  the  nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observation  of Black Music Month was initiated on June 7,
1979, by President Jimmy Carter, who decreed  that  June  would  be  the
month of Black music; since then, American presidents have continued the
practice  and,  for each year of his term, former President Barack Obama
announced the observance  under  a  new  title,  African-American  Music
Appreciation Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  America's  diverse musical heritage is a reflection of the
creativity and optimism of our Nation;  during  Black  Music  Month,  we
celebrate  the  breathtaking  talents and creativity of African-American
vocalists,  instrumentalists,  and  composers  whose  achievements  have
shaped our national culture and enriched our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the  entire  span  of  our  Nation's  history,
African-Americans have created music that communicates across racial and
social boundaries, giving voice to the full range of  human  experience;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  African-Americans'  involuntary  servitude,  music
often served as a means of expressing the inexpressible; when facing the
cruelty of slavery and injustice, spirituals brought a sense of comfort;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These timeless declarations of hope and faith evolved  into
the more modern genres of gospel, blues, ragtime, and jazz, expressed in
the  musical  genius  of Scott Joplin, Marian Anderson, Eubie Blake, and
Mahalia Jackson; during the Civil Rights era, African-American musicians
such as Duke Ellington,  Muddy  Waters,  and  Ruth  Brown  conveyed  the
struggles  of their communities while bringing people of all backgrounds
together; today, this music continues to inspire America's citizens  and
advance its creative spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout the course of American history, Black musicians
have  used  their  great  talents  to  share  the  richness  of  the
African-American  experience and to develop a uniquely American style of
music enjoyed throughout the world; in June 2023, we honor the  pioneers
of  African-American music along with today's artists who continue their
legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, From Ella Fitzgerald making  history  as  the  first  Black
woman  to  win  a  Grammy in 1958, to "Fight For You," the Academy Award
winning best original song in the movie "Judas and The Black Messiah" in
2021, the historic success of Black artists continues to leave its  mark
in  communities,  and we are reminded every day that Black Lives Matter;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A local component, the Harlem  Renaissance,  was  the  name
given  to the cultural, social, and artistic movement that took place in
Harlem between the end of World War I  and  the  middle  of  the  1930s;
during this period, Harlem was a cultural center, drawing Black writers,
artists, musicians, photographers, poets, and scholars; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bronx  is  home to hip-hop, a cultural movement which
formed during the late 1960s among African-American  youth  residing  in
the  South  Bronx  in  New  York City; hip-hop legends who hail from the
Bronx include KOOL DJ Herc, Grandmaster Melle Mel, and Kurtis Blow; and
 
  WHEREAS, Queens, and in particular the neighborhoods of St.  Albans,
Addisleigh  Park  and  Jamaica,  were  the traditional home to an entire
spectrum of musical pioneers and legends, including  Count  Basie,  Lena
Horne,  Ella  Fitzgerald,  Illinois  Jacquet,  James Brown, Milt Hinton,
Cootie Williams, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Nasir Jones, and Russell
Simmons, among so many others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Events which provide a means of preserving a  part  of  our
rich  American  past and which contribute to the community in such noble
endeavors as aforementioned, are held in  the  highest  regard  by  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Black  Music
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
