  §  13-Q. CARE AND TREATMENT OF INJURED EMPLOYEES BY LICENSED OR CERTI-
 FIED ACUPUNCTURISTS. 1. WHERE THE TERM "ACUPUNCTURIST" IS USED  IN  THIS

 SUCH  AN  INJURY COMPENSABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE, MAY LAWFULLY BE TREATED
 BY AN ACUPUNCTURIST AUTHORIZED BY THE CHAIR TO RENDER  ACUPUNCTURE  CARE

 AND SUCH RECORDS OR REPORTS SHALL BE SUBMITTED  TO  THE  CHAIR  ON  SUCH
 FORMS AND AT SUCH TIMES AS THE CHAIR MAY REQUIRE.
  3.  (A) AN ACUPUNCTURIST WHO IS DESIROUS OF BEING AUTHORIZED TO RENDER
 ACUPUNCTURE SERVICES UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL FILE  AN  APPLICATION  FOR
 AUTHORIZATION  UNDER  THIS SECTION WITH THE ACUPUNCTURE PRACTICE COMMIT-
 TEE. THE APPLICANT SHALL AGREE TO REFRAIN FROM SUBSEQUENTLY TREATING FOR
 REMUNERATION, AS A  PRIVATE  PATIENT,  ANY  PERSON  SEEKING  ACUPUNCTURE
 SERVICES,  IN CONNECTION WITH, OR AS A RESULT OF, ANY INJURY COMPENSABLE
 UNDER THIS CHAPTER, IF HE OR SHE HAS  BEEN  REMOVED  FROM  THE  LIST  OF
 ACUPUNCTURISTS  AUTHORIZED  TO RENDER SERVICES UNDER THIS CHAPTER.  THIS
 AGREEMENT SHALL RUN TO THE BENEFIT OF THE INJURED PERSON SO TREATED, AND
 SHALL BE AVAILABLE AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION BY SUCH ACUPUNCTURIST  FOR

 FROM  THE  LIST  OF  ACUPUNCTURISTS  AUTHORIZED  TO  RENDER  ACUPUNCTURE
 SERVICES UNDER THIS SECTION. THE ACUPUNCTURE PRACTICE  COMMITTEE  IF  IT

 SCHEDULES LIMITED TO DEFINED LOCALITIES OF CHARGES AND FEES FOR ACUPUNC-
 TURE TREATMENT AND CARE, TO BE DETERMINED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  AND  BE

 PREPARING SUCH SCHEDULE FOR THE STATE OR SCHEDULES FOR  LIMITED  LOCALI-
 TIES  THE  CHAIR  SHALL  REQUEST  THE  ACUPUNCTURE PRACTICE COMMITTEE TO
 SUBMIT TO SUCH CHAIR A REPORT ON THE AMOUNT OF  REMUNERATION  DEEMED  BY
 SUCH  COMMITTEE  TO  BE  FAIR  AND ADEQUATE FOR THE TYPES OF ACUPUNCTURE
 SERVICES TO BE RENDERED UNDER THIS CHAPTER, BUT CONSIDERATION  SHALL  BE
 GIVEN  TO  THE VIEW OF OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.  THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY
 THE EMPLOYER FOR SUCH TREATMENT AND  SERVICES  SHALL  BE  THE  FEES  AND
 CHARGES ESTABLISHED BY SUCH SCHEDULE.
  (C)  IN DETERMINING THE SCHEDULE OR SCHEDULES AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH
 (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE CHAIR  SHALL  MAKE  A  DISTINCTION  BETWEEN
 TREATMENT  RENDERED  BY  A  DULY  LICENSED  AND REGISTERED ACUPUNCTURIST
 SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THE  EDUCATION
 LAW  AND  A CERTIFIED ACUPUNCTURIST SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION
 EIGHTY-TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN OF THE EDUCATION LAW,  AND  THE  CHAIR  SHALL
 PREPARE AND ESTABLISH A SCHEDULE OR SCHEDULES REFLECTING FEES AND CHARG-
 ES APPROPRIATE TO THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE TREATMENT RENDERED BY EACH
 TYPE  OF  PRACTITIONER, GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO ALL RELEVANT FACTORS
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION OF THE PRACTITION-
 ER, THE TYPE OF TREATMENT RENDERED, WHETHER THE ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT IS

 TREATMENT FURNISHES TO THE EMPLOYER AND DIRECTLY TO THE CHAIR A PRELIMI-
 NARY NOTICE OF SUCH INJURY AND TREATMENT, AND WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS THERE-
 AFTER  A MORE COMPLETE REPORT AND SUBSEQUENT THERETO PROGRESS REPORTS AS
 REQUESTED IN WRITING BY THE CHAIR, BOARD, EMPLOYER OR INSURANCE CARRIER,
 AT INTERVALS OF NOT LESS THAN THREE WEEKS  APART  OR  AT  LESS  FREQUENT
 INTERVALS  IF  REQUESTED ON FORMS PRESCRIBED BY THE CHAIR. THE BOARD MAY

 EXCUSE THE FAILURE TO GIVE SUCH NOTICES WITHIN  THE  DESIGNATED  PERIODS
 WHEN IT FINDS IT TO BE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TO DO SO.
  (B)  UPON  RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE PROVIDED FOR BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION, THE EMPLOYER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE  CLAIMANT  EXAM-
 INED  BY AN ACUPUNCTURIST AT A PLACE REASONABLY CONVENIENT TO THE CLAIM-
 ANT AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CLAIMANT'S ACUPUNCTURIST, AND REFUSAL  BY

 SERVICES RENDERED ONLY TO THE EMPLOYER  UNDER  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 SECTION.
  6.  WHENEVER  HIS  OR  HER  ATTENDANCE  AT  A HEARING IS REQUIRED, THE

 FROM THE EMPLOYER IN AN AMOUNT TO BE FIXED BY THE BOARD, IN ADDITION  TO
 ANY  FEE  PAYABLE UNDER SECTION EIGHT THOUSAND ONE OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE
 LAW AND RULES.
  7. (A) UNLESS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER A BILL HAS BEEN RENDERED TO THE
 EMPLOYER BY THE ACUPUNCTURIST WHO HAS TREATED AN INJURED EMPLOYEE,  SUCH
 EMPLOYER SHALL HAVE NOTIFIED THE CHAIR AND SUCH ACUPUNCTURIST IN WRITING
 THAT  SUCH  EMPLOYER DEMANDS AN IMPARTIAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS OF
 THE AMOUNT CLAIMED BY SUCH ACUPUNCTURIST FOR HIS OR  HER  SERVICES,  THE
 RIGHT  TO SUCH AN IMPARTIAL EXAMINATION SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE WAIVED AND
 THE AMOUNT CLAIMED BY SUCH ACUPUNCTURIST SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE THE  FAIR
 VALUE  OF THE SERVICES RENDERED.  IF THE PARTIES FAIL TO AGREE AS TO THE
 ACUPUNCTURE CARE RENDERED UNDER THIS CHAPTER TO A CLAIMANT,  SUCH  VALUE
 SHALL  BE DECIDED BY THE ACUPUNCTURE PRACTICE COMMITTEE AND THE MAJORITY
 DECISION OF SUCH COMMITTEE SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE UPON THE  PARTIES  AS  TO
 THE  VALUE OF THE SERVICES RENDERED. THE BOARD MAY MAKE AN AWARD FOR ANY
 SUCH BILL OR PART THEREOF WHICH REMAINS UNPAID IN THE SAME MANNER AS  AN
 AWARD  FOR  BILLS  RENDERED  UNDER SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND THREE OF SECTION
 THIRTEEN-G OF THIS ARTICLE, AND SUCH AWARD  MAY  BE  COLLECTED  IN  LIKE
 MANNER  AS  AN  AWARD OF COMPENSATION. THE CHAIR SHALL ASSESS THE SUM OF

 SERVICES,  THE  REPORT  OR  TESTIMONY  OF  AN  AUTHORIZED  ACUPUNCTURIST
 CONCERNING  THE  CONDITION  OF AN INJURED EMPLOYEE AND TREATMENT THEREOF

 ACUPUNCTURIST  AS  TO CAUSAL RELATION AND AS TO REQUIRED TREATMENT SHALL
 S. 6775  4
 
 BE DEEMED COMPETENT BUT  SHALL  NOT  BE  CONTROLLING.  NOTHING  IN  THIS
 SECTION  SHALL BE DEEMED TO DEPRIVE ANY EMPLOYER OR INSURANCE CARRIER OF
