  (4)  A  majority  of  the  members  of  the task force in office shall
 constitute a quorum for the transaction of business or the  exercise  of
 any  power or function of the task force. An act, determination or deci-

 selected  by the task force to provide expertise of interest specific to
 the charge of such committees.
  (e) The task force may, as it deems appropriate, request that studies,
 surveys, or analyses relating to the task force's powers and  duties  be
 performed by any state department, commission, agency or public authori-
 ty.  All  state departments, commissions, agencies or public authorities
 shall provide information and advice in a timely  manner  and  otherwise
 assist the task force with its work.
  (f)  The  task  force  shall submit a request for any appropriation as

 duties to the governor, director of the division of budget,  and  chair-
 persons  of the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means
 committee.
  (g) The task force may hold public hearings, take testimony  and  make
 investigations at such places as it deems necessary.

 findings, conclusions, recommendations and activities already undertaken
 by  the task force, not later than 22 months after the effective date of

 deems necessary to implement its recommendations.

 have become a law and shall expire 2 years  after  such  effective  date
 when upon such date the provisions of this act shall be deemed repealed.
