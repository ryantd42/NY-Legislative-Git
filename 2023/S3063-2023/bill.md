 AN ACT to amend the public health  law,  in  relation  to  enacting  the
  tobacco product waste reduction act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "tobacco
 product waste reduction act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature finds and declares the
 following:
  1. The use of tobacco products causes death and disease and  continues
 to be an urgent public health challenge. The United States Department of
 Health  and  Human  Services and the New York State Department of Health
 have reported the following:
  a. Tobacco-related illness is the leading cause of  preventable  death
 in  the  United  States,  accounting for about 480,000 deaths each year,
 including 28,200 New York adults.
  b. Annually in New York State, 10,600 youth become new  daily  smokers
 and  an  estimated  280,000 New York youth now alive will die early from
 smoking.
  c. Tobacco use can cause chronic lung disease, diabetes, eye  disease,
 rheumatoid arthritis, coronary heart disease, stroke, ectopic pregnancy,
 and  infertility,  in  addition  to  leukemia  and  cancer of the lungs,
 larynx, colon, liver,  esophagus,  pancreas,  kidney,  cervix,  bladder,
 stomach, and mouth.
  d.  Tobacco-related  health  care  annually  costs  New  Yorkers $10.4
 billion, including $3.3 billion in Medicaid expenses.
  2.  Cigarette filters, also known as butts, do not improve the  safety
 or  healthfulness  of cigarettes or other tobacco products, and research
 indicates that they likely increase the negative public  health  effects
 of tobacco products.

  a.  According  to  a 2014 Surgeon General's report, "evidence suggests
 that ventilated filters may have contributed to  higher  risks  of  lung
 cancer  by  enabling  smokers to inhale more vigorously, thereby drawing
 carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke more deeply into lung tissue."
  b.  The perception that filtered cigarettes are safer encourages smok-
 ing and leads to increased public  harm.  In  2010,  the  United  States
 joined  Canada and the EU in prohibiting the use of tobacco packaging or
 advertising using terms like "light," "mild," or "low," which convey the
 false impression that filters reduce risk.
  c. A 2017 study from the National Cancer  Institute  recommended  that
 "the  FDA should consider regulating {filter use}, up to and including a
 ban."
  3. Electronic cigarettes and similar products pose health hazards  and
 may  contribute  to youth smoking and reduced smoking cessation, regard-
 less of nicotine content.
  a. These products contain or produce  chemicals  other  than  nicotine
 known  to  be toxic, carcinogenic and causative of respiratory and heart
 distress.
  b. Emissions from these products may contain particulate matter, harm-
 ful to those exposed, including bystanders  involuntarily  exposed.  The
 United  States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has presented evidence
 of nicotine and other toxicants in exhaled electronic cigarette  aerosol
 and stated exposure should be limited.
  c. Nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes are the most common nico-
 tine  products  used  by  students,  with  three million middle and high
 school students using them since 2015, according to a study published in
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
  d. The FDA has expressed concern that use of these  products,  whether
 or not they contain nicotine, will provide visual cues to youth and will
 renormalize  cigarette  smoking and use of tobacco products, undermining
 tobacco control  effort  and  contributing  to  smoking  initiation  and
 reduced cessation, particularly among youth.
  4.  Cigarette  butts are a plastic product that significantly contrib-
 utes to pollution in soil,  waterways,  and  beaches,  and  impacts  the
 health  of  fish  and  other wildlife, as well as the safety of the food
 supply for humans.
  a. Cigarette butts are the  most  collected  item  internationally  in
 beach  and  waterway cleanup programs. It is estimated that 5.6 trillion
 cigarette butts end up as  litter annually worldwide,  totaling  845,000
 tons  of waste. Plastic cigar tips, commonly sold and used with cigaril-
 los and small cigars, are also among the world's most littered objects.
  b. Cigarette butts have been described as  "the last socially accepted
 form of litter." A 2012 survey of cigarette  smokers  published  in  the
 International  Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found
 that 55.7 percent reported littering cigarette butts in the past month.
  c. Nearly all cigarette filters are made of cellulose acetate, a  king
 of  plastic.  They  are not biodegradable. Instead, they break down into
 small particles that end up in waterways, in  the  bodies  of  fish  and
 other animals, and eventually in our food supply.
  d.  Even  if  filters  could  be made of biodegradable materials, they
 would still be rendered hazardous due to toxins accumulated in the smok-
 ing process, including arsenic, cadmium, toluene, nicotine,  and  ethyl-
 phenol, as well as bio-accumulated toxins from the environment.
  e.  Single-use electronic cigarettes and cartridges contain components
 such as lithium-ion batteries, as well as  toxic  chemicals  and  liquid
 nicotine  that together qualify them as electronic, toxic, and hazardous

 waste. A single user could discard hundreds of  single-use  e-cigarettes
 every  year.  Such  waste  is  inappropriate  for  standard  municipal
 collection.
  f.  The  cost  to  individual  municipalities of cleaning up cigarette
 butts and single-use electronic cigarettes can  run  into  the  tens  of
 millions of dollars.
  5.  Littered  cigarette  filters  and  liquid nicotine from single-use
 electronic cigarettes and cartridges pose a health threat to young chil-
 dren.
  a. In  2013,  the  American  Association  of  Poison  Control  Centers
 reported  receiving over 8,500 reports of children under age 13 poisoned
 by cigarettes, cigarette butts, and other tobacco products.
  b. Children poisoned by cigarette butts or liquid nicotine can experi-
 ence vomiting, nausea, lethargy, eye irritation, and gagging.
  c. Calls to American poison control centers concerning liquid nicotine
 exposures increased from one in February 2010 to 2,015 in February 2014,
 most of which involved children under the age of five,  according  to  a
 study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
  6.  Efforts to prevent litter of cigarette filters or single-use elec-
 tronic cigarettes by educating consumers have failed.
  7. By banning the sale of cigarettes with single-use filters, New York
 State will mitigate a source of plastic pollution while having  a  posi-
 tive impact on public health.
  §  3.  The  public  health  law  is  amended  by  adding a new section
 1399-mm-4 to read as follows:
