 primarily  for  personal, family or household, OR COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS
 purposes and any other person entitled by the terms of  the  manufactur-
 er's warranty to enforce the obligations of such warranty;

 teen thousand miles of operation or  during  the  period  of  two  years
 following  the  date  of  original delivery of the motor vehicle to such
 [consumer] PURCHASER, whichever is  the  earlier  date,  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  shall  during such period report the nonconformity, defect or
 condition to the manufacturer, its agent or its  authorized  dealer.  If
 the  notification  is received by the manufacturer's agent or authorized
 dealer, the agent or dealer shall  within  seven  days  forward  written

 requested, and shall include  in  such  notice  a  statement  indicating
 whether  or not such repairs have been undertaken. The manufacturer, its
 agent or its authorized dealer shall correct said nonconformity,  defect
 or  condition  at no charge to the [consumer] PURCHASER, notwithstanding
 the fact that such repairs are made after the expiration of such  period
 of operation or such two year period.
  (2)  If  a manufacturer's agent or authorized dealer refuses to under-
 take repairs within seven days of receipt of the notice by a  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  of a nonconformity, defect or condition pursuant to paragraph
 one of  this  subdivision,  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  may  immediately
 forward  written notice of such refusal to the manufacturer by certified
 mail, return receipt requested.  The  manufacturer  or  its  authorized
 agent  shall  have twenty days from receipt of such notice of refusal to
 commence such repairs. If within such twenty day period, the manufactur-
 er or its authorized agent fails to commence such repairs, the  manufac-
 turer,  at  the  option  of  the [consumer] PURCHASER, shall replace the
 motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle, or accept return  of  the
 vehicle  from  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  and  refund to the [consumer]
 PURCHASER the full purchase price or, if applicable, the lease price and
 any trade-in allowance plus fees and  charges.  Such  fees  and  charges
 shall  include but not be limited to all license fees, registration fees
 and any similar governmental charges, less an allowance for the [consum-
 er's] PURCHASER'S use of the vehicle in excess of the first twelve thou-
 sand miles of  operation  pursuant  to  the  mileage  deduction  formula
 defined  in  paragraph  four  of  subdivision (a) of this section, and a
 reasonable allowance for any damage not attributable to normal  wear  or
 improvements.
  §  3.  Paragraphs  1  and 2 of subdivision (c) of section 198-a of the
 general business law, paragraph 1 as amended by chapter 234 of the  laws
 of  1990,  paragraph 2 as amended by chapter 29 of the laws of 1989, are
 amended to read as follows:
  (1) If, within  the  period  specified  in  subdivision  (b)  of  this
 section, the manufacturer or its agents or authorized dealers are unable
 to repair or correct any defect or condition which substantially impairs
 the  value  of  the  motor  vehicle  to the [consumer] PURCHASER after a
 reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer, at the  option  of  the
 [consumer]  PURCHASER, shall replace the motor vehicle with a comparable
 motor vehicle, or accept return  of  the  vehicle  from  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER and refund to the [consumer] PURCHASER the full purchase price
 or,  if applicable, the lease price and any trade-in allowance plus fees
 and charges. Any return of a motor vehicle may, at  the  option  of  the
 [consumer] PURCHASER, be made to the dealer or other authorized agent of
 the manufacturer who sold such vehicle to the [consumer] PURCHASER or to
 the  dealer or other authorized agent who attempted to repair or correct
 the defect or condition which necessitated the return and shall  not  be
 subject  to  any  further  shipping charges. Such fees and charges shall
 include but not be limited to all license fees,  registration  fees  and
 any similar governmental charges, less an allowance for the [consumer's]
 PURCHASER'S  use  of  the vehicle in excess of the first twelve thousand
 miles of operation pursuant to the mileage deduction formula defined  in
 paragraph  four  of  subdivision  (a)  of this section, and a reasonable
 allowance for any damage not attributable to  normal  wear  or  improve-
 ments.
  (2)  A  manufacturer which accepts return of the motor vehicle because
 the motor vehicle does not conform to  its  warranty  shall  notify  the
 commissioner  of the department of motor vehicles that the motor vehicle
 A. 2226  3
 
 was returned to the manufacturer for nonconformity to its  warranty  and
 shall  disclose,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section four
 hundred seventeen-a of the vehicle  and  traffic  law  prior  to  resale
 either  at  wholesale  or retail, that it was previously returned to the
 manufacturer for nonconformity to its warranty. Refunds shall be made to
 the [consumer] PURCHASER and lienholder, if any, as their interests  may
 appear on the records of ownership kept by the department of motor vehi-
 cles.  Refunds shall be accompanied by the proper application for credit
 or  refund of state and local sales taxes as published by the department
 of taxation and finance and by a notice that the sales tax paid  on  the
 purchase price, lease price or portion thereof being refunded is refund-
 able  by the commissioner of taxation and finance in accordance with the
 provisions of subdivision (f) of section eleven hundred  thirty-nine  of
 the  tax  law.  If  applicable,  refunds shall be made to the lessor and
 lessee as their interests may appear on the records of ownership kept by
 the department of motor vehicles, as follows: the lessee  shall  receive
 the  capitalized  cost and the lessor shall receive the lease price less
 the aggregate deposit and rental payments previously paid to the  lessor
 for  the  leased  vehicle. The terms of the lease shall be deemed termi-
 nated contemporaneously with the date of the arbitrator's  decision  and
 award and no penalty for early termination shall be assessed as a result
 thereof. Refunds shall be accompanied by the proper application form for
 credit  or  refund  of  state  and  local  sales tax as published by the
 department of taxation and finance and a notice that the sales tax  paid
 on  the  lease  price or portion thereof being refunded is refundable by
 the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  of  subdivision (f) of section eleven hundred thirty-nine of
 the tax law.
  § 4. Subdivision (h) of section 198-a of the general business law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  799  of  the  laws  of 1986, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (h) A manufacturer shall have up to thirty  days  from  the  date  the
 [consumer]  PURCHASER notifies the manufacturer of his or her acceptance
 of the arbitrator's decision to comply with the terms of that  decision.
 Failure  to comply with the thirty day limitation shall also entitle the
 [consumer] PURCHASER to recover a fee of twenty-five  dollars  for  each
 business  day  of  noncompliance  up  to five hundred dollars. Provided,
 however, that nothing contained in this  subdivision  shall  impose  any
 liability  on  a manufacturer where a delay beyond the thirty day period
 is attributable to a [consumer] PURCHASER who has requested  a  replace-
 ment  vehicle  built to order or with options that are not comparable to
 the vehicle being replaced or otherwise made compliance impossible with-
 in said period. In  no  event  shall  a  [consumer]  PURCHASER  who  has
 resorted  to  an informal dispute settlement mechanism be precluded from
 seeking the rights or remedies available by law.
  § 5. Subdivision (i) of section 198-a of the general business law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  415  of  the  laws  of 1987, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (i) Any agreement entered into  by  a  [consumer]  PURCHASER  for  the
 purchase  of  a  new motor vehicle which waives, limits or disclaims the
 rights set forth in this section shall be void  as  contrary  to  public
 policy. Said rights shall inure to a subsequent transferee of such motor
 vehicle.
  Any  provision of any agreement entered into by a [consumer] PURCHASER
 for the purchase of a new motor vehicle which includes as an  additional
 cost  for  such  motor  vehicle  an  expense identified as being for the
 A. 2226  4
 
 purpose of affording such [consumer] PURCHASER his or her  rights  under
 this section, shall be void as contrary to public policy.

 added by chapter 444 of the laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  (j) Any action brought pursuant to this  section  shall  be  commenced
 within  four years of the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle
 to the [consumer] PURCHASER.

 amended  by  chapter  611  of  the  laws  of 2005, is amended to read as

 dispute  arising  under  this  section  upon the payment of a prescribed
 filing fee to an alternate arbitration mechanism established pursuant to
 regulations promulgated hereunder by the New York state attorney  gener-
 al.  Upon  application  of  the  [consumer] PURCHASER and payment of the
 filing fee, all manufacturers  shall  submit  to  such  alternate  arbi-
 tration.
  Such  alternate arbitration shall be conducted by a professional arbi-
 trator or arbitration firm appointed by  and  under  regulations  estab-
 lished  by  the  New  York  state attorney general. Such mechanism shall
 [insure] ENSURE the personal objectivity  of  its  arbitrators  and  the
 right  of each party to present its case, to be in attendance during any
 presentation made by the other party and to rebut or refute such presen-
 tation. In all other  respects,  such  alternate  arbitration  mechanism
 shall  be governed by article seventy-five of the civil practice law and
 rules; provided, however, that notwithstanding paragraph (i) of subdivi-
 sion (a) of section seventy-five hundred two of the civil  practice  law
 and  rules,  special proceedings brought before a court pursuant to such
 article seventy-five in relation to an arbitration  hereunder  shall  be
 brought  only  in  the  county where the [consumer] PURCHASER resides or
 where the arbitration was held or is pending.
  § 8. Subdivision (l) of section 198-a of the general business law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  487  of  the  laws  of 1990, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (l) A court may award  reasonable  attorney's  fees  to  a  prevailing
 plaintiff  or  to  a  [consumer]  PURCHASER who prevails in any judicial
 action or proceeding arising  out  of  an  arbitration  proceeding  held
 pursuant  to  subdivision (k) of this section. In the event a prevailing

 rendered to enforce collection of said award.

 198-a of the general business law, as added by chapter 799 of  the  laws
 of 1986, is amended to read as follows:

 the general business law, paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 as  amended  by  chapter
 635  of  the  laws  of 2004, paragraph 6 as amended by chapter 26 of the
 laws of 2005, are amended to read as follows:
  (4) If, within the first  eighteen  thousand  miles  of  operation  or
 during  the  period of two years following the date of original delivery
 of the motor vehicle to such  [consumer]  PURCHASER,  whichever  is  the
 earlier  date,  the  manufacturer  of  a motor home or its agents or its
 authorized dealers or repair shops to  which  they  refer  a  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  are  unable to repair or correct any covered defect or condi-
 tion which substantially impairs the value of  the  motor  home  to  the
 [consumer]  PURCHASER  after  a reasonable number of attempts, the motor
 home manufacturer, at the option  of  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER,  shall
 replace the motor home with a comparable motor home, or accept return of
 the  motor home from the [consumer] PURCHASER and refund to the [consum-
 er] PURCHASER the full purchase price or, if applicable, the lease price
 and any trade-in allowance plus fees and charges as well  as  the  other
 fees  and  charges set forth in paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this
 section.
  (5) If an agent or authorized dealer of a motor home manufacturer or a
 repair shop to which they refer a [consumer] PURCHASER refuses to under-
 take repairs within seven days of receipt  of  notice  by  a  [consumer]
 PURCHASER of a nonconformity, defect or condition within the first eigh-
 teen  thousand  miles  of  operation  or  during the period of two years
 following the date of original  delivery  of  the  motor  home  to  such
 [consumer]  PURCHASER,  whichever  is  the  earlier date, the [consumer]
 PURCHASER may immediately forward written notice of such refusal to  the
 motor home manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The
 motor  home  manufacturer  or  its  authorized agent or a repair shop to
 which they refer a [consumer] PURCHASER  shall  have  twenty  days  from
 receipt  of  such  notice of refusal to commence such repairs. If within
 such twenty day period, the motor home manufacturer  or  its  authorized
 agent  or  repair shop to which they refer a [consumer] PURCHASER, fails
 to commence such repairs, the motor home manufacturer, at the option  of
 the [consumer] PURCHASER, shall replace the motor home with a comparable
 motor  home,  or  accept  return  of  the motor home from the [consumer]
 PURCHASER and refund to the [consumer] PURCHASER the full purchase price
 or, if applicable, the lease price, and any trade-in allowance or  other
 charges,  fees,  or  allowances. Such fees and charges shall include but
 not be limited to all license fees, registration fees, and  any  similar
 governmental charges, less an allowance for the [consumer's] PURCHASER'S
 use of the vehicle in excess of the first twelve thousand miles of oper-
 ation  pursuant  to  the  mileage deduction formula defined in paragraph
 four of subdivision (a) of this section, and a reasonable allowance  for
 any damage not attributable to normal wear or improvements.
  (6) If within the first eighteen thousand miles of operation or during
 the  period  of two years following the date of original delivery of the
 motor home to such [consumer] PURCHASER, whichever is the earlier  date,
 the  same covered nonconformity, defect or condition in a motor home has
 been subject to repair two times or a motor home has been out of service
 by reason of repair for twenty-one days,  whichever  occurs  first,  the
 A. 2226  6
 
 [consumer]  PURCHASER must have reported this to the motor home manufac-
 turer or  its  authorized  dealer  by  certified  mail,  return  receipt
 requested,  and may institute any proceeding or other action pursuant to
 this  section  if  the  motor  home has been out of service by reason of
 three repair attempts or for at least thirty days. The special notifica-
 tion requirements of this paragraph shall only apply if the manufacturer
 or its authorized dealer provides a prior written copy of  the  require-
 ments  of  this paragraph to the [consumer] PURCHASER and receipt of the
 notice is acknowledged by the [consumer] PURCHASER in  writing.  If  the
 [consumer] PURCHASER who has received notice from the manufacturer fails
 to  comply with the special notification requirements of this paragraph,
 additional repair attempts or days out of service by  reason  of  repair
 shall  not  be  taken into account in determining whether the [consumer]
 PURCHASER is entitled to a remedy provided in  paragraph  four  of  this
 subdivision.  However, additional repair attempts or days out of service
 by reason of repair that occur after the [consumer]  PURCHASER  complies
 with  such special notification requirements shall be taken into account
 in making that determination. It shall not count as a repair attempt  if
 the  repair  facility  is  not  authorized  by the applicable motor home
 manufacturer to perform warranty work on the  identified  nonconformity.
 It  shall  count as only one repair attempt for a motor home if the same
 nonconformity is being addressed a second time due to  the  [consumer's]
 PURCHASER'S decision to continue traveling and to seek the repair of the
 same  nonconformity  at another repair facility rather than wait for the
 initial repair to be completed.
  (7) Nothing in this section shall in any way limit any  rights,  reme-
 dies  or  causes  of  action  that  a [consumer] PURCHASER or motor home
 manufacturer may otherwise have against the manufacturer  of  the  motor
 home's chassis, or its propulsion and other components.
  § 12. Clause (i) of subparagraph (A) and the second undesignated para-
 graph  of  subparagraph (B) of paragraph 8 of subdivision (n) of section

 in arbitration and familiar with the provisions of  this  section,  that
 the  arbitrators  and [consumers] PURCHASERS who request arbitration are
 provided with a written copy of the provisions of this section, together
 with the notice set forth below entitled "NEW MOTOR HOME LEMON LAW  BILL
 OF  RIGHTS", and that [consumers] PURCHASERS, upon request, are given an
 opportunity to make an oral presentation to the arbitrator;
  The following notice shall be provided to [consumers]  PURCHASERS  and
 arbitrators  and  shall  be  printed  in conspicuous ten point bold face
 type:

 [CONSUMER] PURCHASER AFTER A REASONABLE NUMBER OF  ATTEMPTS,  THE  MOTOR
 HOME  MANUFACTURER,  AT  THE  OPTION  OF THE [CONSUMER] PURCHASER, SHALL
 REPLACE THE MOTOR HOME WITH A COMPARABLE MOTOR HOME, OR ACCEPT RETURN OF

 TRATION FEES, AND ANY SIMILAR GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES,  LESS  AN  ALLOWANCE

 THOUSAND MILES TIMES THE PURCHASE PRICE, OR THE LEASE PRICE IF  APPLICA-

 as required by the warranty specified in this section which substantial-
 ly impairs the value  of  the  used  motor  vehicle  to  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  after  a  reasonable  period of time, the dealer shall accept
 return of the used motor  vehicle  from  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  and

 dealer elects to not return any vehicles  traded-in  by  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER,  the wholesale value of any such traded-in vehicles as listed
 in the National Auto Dealers Association Used Car Guide, or  such  other
 guide as may be specified in regulations promulgated by the commissioner
 of  motor vehicles, as adjusted for mileage, improvements, and any major
 physical or mechanical defects in the traded-in vehicle at the  time  of

 tled to a refund pursuant to this section,  the  value  of  any  vehicle
 traded-in  by  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER,  if  the dealer elects to not
 return it to the [consumer] PURCHASER, for purposes of  determining  the
 amount  of  such  refund will be determined by reference to the National
 Auto Dealers Association Used Car Guide wholesale value, or  such  other
 guide  as  may  be  approved  by  the commissioner of motor vehicles, as
 adjusted for mileage, improvements, and any major physical or mechanical
 defects, rather than the value listed in  the  sales  contract.  Refunds
 shall  be  made  to  the [consumer] PURCHASER and lienholder, if any, as
 A. 2226  9
 
 their interests may appear on the  records  of  ownership  kept  by  the
 department  of motor vehicles. If the amount to be refunded to the lien-
 holder will be insufficient to discharge  the  lien,  the  dealer  shall
 notify  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER in writing by registered or certified
 mail that the [consumer] PURCHASER has thirty days to pay the lienholder
 the amount which, together with the amount to be refunded by the dealer,
 will be sufficient to discharge the lien. The notice to  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  shall  contain  conspicuous  language  warning the [consumer]
 PURCHASER that failure to pay such funds to the lienholder within thirty
 days will terminate the dealer's obligation to provide a refund. If  the
 [consumer]  PURCHASER fails to make such payment within thirty days, the
 dealer shall have no further responsibility to provide  a  refund  under
 this  section.  Alternatively, the dealer may elect to offer to replace
 the used motor vehicle with  a  comparably  priced  vehicle,  with  such
 adjustment in price as the parties may agree to. The [consumer] PURCHAS-
 ER  shall  not  be  obligated  to  accept a replacement vehicle, but may
 instead elect to receive the refund  provided  under  this  section.  It
 shall be an affirmative defense to any claim under this section that:
  (a)  The  malfunction  or  defect  does  not substantially impair such
 value; or
  (b) The malfunction or defect is  the  result  of  abuse,  neglect  or
 unreasonable modifications or alterations of the used motor vehicle.
  § 19. Subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 and paragraph 4 of subdivision c
 of  section 198-b of the general business law, as amended by chapter 444
 of the laws of 1989, are amended to read as follows:
  (b) The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair  or  malfunction
 or  defect  for  a  cumulative  total of fifteen or more days during the
 warranty period. Said period shall not include days when the  dealer  is
 unable to complete the repair because of the unavailability of necessary
 repair  parts. The dealer shall be required to exercise due diligence in
 attempting to obtain necessary repair parts. Provided, however, that  if
 a  vehicle  has been out of service for a cumulative total of forty-five
 days, even if a portion of that time is attributable to the unavailabil-
 ity of replacement parts, the [consumer] PURCHASER shall be entitled  to
 the replacement or refund remedies provided in this section.
  4. The term of any warranty, service contract or repair insurance, and
 the  fifteen  day  out-of-service  period, shall be extended by any time
 during which  repair  services  are  not  available  to  the  [consumer]
 PURCHASER  because  of  a  war, invasion or strike, fire, flood or other
 natural disaster.
  § 20. Subdivisions d and e of section 198-b of  the  general  business
 law,  as  amended  by  chapter  444  of the laws of 1989, paragraph 3 of
 subdivision d as amended by chapter 692 of the laws of 1994, are amended
 to read as follows:
  d. Waiver void. 1. Any agreement entered into by a [consumer] PURCHAS-
 ER for the purchase or lease of  a  used  motor  vehicle  which  waives,
 limits  or  disclaims the rights set forth in this article shall be void
 as contrary to public policy. Further, if a dealer  fails  to  give  the
 written warranty required by this article, the dealer nevertheless shall
 be deemed to have given said warranty as a matter of law.
  2.  Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the rights or reme-
 dies which are otherwise available to a [consumer] PURCHASER  under  any
 other law.
  3.  Notwithstanding  paragraph  one  of this subdivision, this article
 shall not apply to used motor vehicles sold for, or in  the  case  of  a
 lease  where  the  value  of  the used motor vehicle as agreed to by the
 A. 2226  10
 
 [consumer] PURCHASER and the dealer which vehicle is the subject of  the
 contract  is,  less  than  one thousand five hundred dollars, or to used
 motor vehicles with over one hundred thousand miles at the time of  sale
 or  lease if said mileage is indicated in writing at the time of sale or
 lease. Further, this article shall not apply to the  sale  or  lease  of
 historical  motor vehicles as defined in section four hundred one of the
 vehicle and traffic law.
  e. Time of delivery, location of  warranty  and  notice.  The  written
 warranty  provided  for in subdivision b of this section and the written
 notice provided for in subdivision c of this section shall be  delivered
 to  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  at  or  before  the  time the [consumer]
 PURCHASER signs the sales or lease contract for the used motor  vehicle.
 The warranty and the notice may be set forth on one sheet or on separate
 sheets.  They  may be separate from, attached to, or a part of the sales
 or lease contract. If they are part of the sales or lease contract, they
 shall be separated from the other contract provisions and each headed by
 a conspicuous title.
  § 21. The opening paragraph of paragraph 1 of subdivision f of section
 198-b of the general business law, as separately amended by chapters 444
 and 609 of the laws of 1989, is amended to read as follows:
  If a dealer has established or participates  in  an  informal  dispute
 settlement  procedure which complies in all respects with the provisions
 of part seven hundred three of title sixteen  of  the  code  of  federal
 regulations  the  provisions  of  this  article  concerning  refunds  or
 replacement shall not apply to any consumer who has not  first  resorted
 to  such procedure. Dealers utilizing informal dispute settlement proce-
 dures pursuant to this subdivision shall [insure] ENSURE  that  arbitra-
 tors  participating  in  such informal dispute settlement procedures are
 familiar with the provisions of this section and shall provide to  arbi-
 trators  and  [consumers]  PURCHASERS who seek arbitration a copy of the
 provisions of  this  section  together  with  the  following  notice  in
 conspicuous ten point bold face type:
  § 22. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of subdivision f of section 198-b of
 the general business law, paragraphs 2, 4 and 6 as separately amended by
 chapters  444  and  609  of  the laws of 1989, paragraph 3 as amended by
 chapter 323 of the laws of 1997, paragraph 5 as amended by  chapter  487
 of the laws of 1990, are amended to read as follows:
  2.  A  dealer  shall have up to thirty days from the date of notice by
 the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  that  the  arbitrator's  decision  has  been
 accepted  to  comply with the terms of such decision. Provided, however,
 that nothing contained in this subdivision shall impose any liability on
 a dealer where a delay beyond the thirty day period is attributable to a
 [consumer] PURCHASER who has requested a particular replacement  vehicle
 or otherwise made compliance impossible within said period.
  3. Upon the payment of a prescribed filing fee, a [consumer] PURCHASER
 shall  have  the  option  of  submitting  any dispute arising under this
 section to an alternate arbitration mechanism  established  pursuant  to
 regulations promulgated hereunder by the attorney general. Upon applica-
 tion  of  the  [consumer]  PURCHASER  and payment of the filing fee, the
 dealer shall submit to such alternate arbitration.
  Such alternate arbitration shall be conducted by a professional  arbi-
 trator  or  arbitration  firm  appointed by and under regulations estab-
 lished by the attorney general. Such mechanism shall ensure the personal
 objectivity of its arbitrators and the right of each  party  to  present
 its  case, to be in attendance during any presentation made by the other
 party and to rebut or refute such presentation. In all  other  respects,
 A. 2226  11
 
 such alternate arbitration mechanism shall be governed by article seven-
 ty-five of the civil practice law and rules.
  The  notice  required  by  paragraph one of this subdivision, entitled
 Used Car Lemon Law Bill of Rights, shall be provided to arbitrators  and
 [consumers] PURCHASERS who seek arbitration under this subdivision.
  A  dealer shall have thirty days from the date of mailing of a copy of
 the arbitrator's decision to such dealer to comply  with  the  terms  of
 such  decision.  Failure  to  comply  within the thirty day period shall
 entitle the [consumer] PURCHASER to recover, in addition  to  any  other
 recovery  to  which he may be entitled, a fee of twenty-five dollars for
 each business day  beyond  thirty  days  up  to  five  hundred  dollars;
 provided  however,  that  nothing  in  this subdivision shall impose any
 liability on a dealer where a delay beyond  the  thirty  day  period  is
 attributable  to  a  [consumer] PURCHASER who has requested a particular
 replacement vehicle or otherwise made compliance impossible within  said
 period.
  The  commissioner of motor vehicles or any person deputized by him may
 deny the application of any person for registration under  section  four
 hundred  fifteen  of the vehicle and traffic law and suspend or revoke a
 registration under such section or refuse to issue a renewal thereof  if
 he  or  such  deputy determines that such applicant or registrant or any
 officer, director, stockholder, or partner, or any other person directly
 or indirectly interested in the business has deliberately failed to  pay
 an arbitration award, which has not been stayed or appealed, rendered in
 an  arbitration  proceeding  pursuant  to  this paragraph for sixty days
 after the date of mailing of a copy of the award to the registrant.  Any
 action  taken  by  the  commissioner  of motor vehicles pursuant to this
 paragraph shall be governed by the procedures set forth  in  subdivision
 nine of section four hundred fifteen of the vehicle and traffic law.
  4.  In  no  event  shall a [consumer] PURCHASER who has resorted to an
 informal dispute settlement procedure  be  precluded  from  seeking  the
 rights or remedies available by law.
  5. In an action brought to enforce the provisions of this article, the
 court  may award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff or
 to a [consumer]  PURCHASER  who  prevails  in  any  judicial  action  or
 proceeding  arising  out  of  an arbitration proceeding held pursuant to
 paragraph three of this subdivision. In the event a prevailing plaintiff
 is required to retain the services of an attorney to enforce  collection
 of  an  award  granted  pursuant  to  this section, the court may assess
 against the dealer reasonable attorney's fees for services  rendered  to
 enforce collection of said award.
  6.  Any  action  brought  pursuant  to this article shall be commenced
 within four years of the date of original delivery  of  the  used  motor
 vehicle to the [consumer] PURCHASER.
  §  23.  Subdivision g of section 198-b of the general business law, as
 added by chapter 147 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  g. Notice of [consumer] PURCHASER rights. At the time of  purchase  or
 lease  of  a  used motor vehicle from a dealer in this state, the dealer
 shall provide to the [consumer] PURCHASER a notice, printed in not  less
 than  eight  point  bold face type, entitled "Used Car Lemon Law Bill of
 Rights". The text of such notice shall  be  identical  with  the  notice
 required by paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.
  §  24.  Paragraph 3 of subdivision (b) of section 198-c of the general
 business law, as added by chapter 254 of the laws of 2010, is amended to
 read as follows:
 A. 2226  12
 
  (3) The time period specified in paragraph one or two of this subdivi-
 sion may be shortened if the dealer and [consumer] PURCHASER  agree,  in
 writing, to a shorter time period.
  § 25. This act shall take effect immediately.
