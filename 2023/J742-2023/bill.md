  COMMENDING  Firefighter  Andre  Tessier  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after 20 years of dedicated service to the Williston
  Park Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter Andre Tessier upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for
special  recognition  after 20 years of dedicated service as a member of
Company No. 1 with the Williston Park Fire Department to  be  celebrated
at  its  Annual  Inspection  Dinner  on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the
Milleridge Inn in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Andre Tessier joined the Williston Park Fire Department  on
January  7,  2003;  throughout  his 20 years of service, he held several
positions  within  the  Department  including:  Financial  Secretary
(2012-present); and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Andre Tessier is one such firefighter; throughout 20  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Firefighter Andre Tessier upon the occasion of  his  designation
for  special  recognition  after  20  years  of dedicated service to the
Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Andre Tessier.
