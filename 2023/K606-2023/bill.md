  COMMENDING  the  National  Wild  Turkey Federation
  upon  the  occasion  of  celebrating  its  50th
  Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing welfare of the citizens of the State of New York  is  greatly
enriched  and  reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors of those
organizations committed to the preservation of the  natural  world,  the
enrichment  of knowledge of local and global wildlife, and the promotion
of environmental citizenship; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the  National  Wild  Turkey  Federation  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating its 50th Anniversary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Wild  Turkey  Federation provides ceaseless
support to science-based  wildlife  management,  research,  and  habitat
conservation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  course  of  50  years, the National Wild Turkey
Federation, its chapters, and members across the nation have worked with
state, federal, and nongovernmental partners to promote the conservation
of the wild  turkey  and  the  preservation  of  our  hunting  heritage,
participating  in  one  of  the greatest conservation success stories in
American history-the return  of  the  wild  turkey  from  the  brink  of
extinction; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Wild Turkey Federation and its chapters and
members  have  been  the  vanguard  of  reversing  declining  hunting
participation  through  nationwide  investment  in  hunter  recruitment,
retention, and reactivation  efforts,  and  partnering  with  states  to
develop  opportunities  to  engage  people from all walks of life in the
outdoors tradition; since  2012,  the  organization  has  recruited  and
reactivated more than 1.5 million hunters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Wild Turkey Federation and its chapters and
members have invested more than half a billion dollars  to  conserve  or
enhance  more  than  22  million  acres  of  critical  wildlife habitat,
forests, and grasslands across public  and  private  lands  since  1985,
while  also providing more than $8.5 million throughout North America to
ensure wild turkey populations exist well into the future; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Wild Turkey  Federation  is  the  largest  and
longest-serving nongovernmental stewardship partner of the United States
Department  of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, conserving habitats on
National Forest System lands for over 40 years and heavily  engaging  in
the  development  and  implementation  of  the  USDA's  Wildfire  Crisis
Strategy; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Wild Turkey Federation works across  ownership
boundaries  to  increase  clean  and abundant water, healthy forests and
 
wildlife  habitat,  resilient  communities,  and  robust  recreational
opportunities across the Country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This esteemed organization, its chapters, and all members,
deserve just recognition for their tireless and selfless work to further
scientific,  state-led  wildlife  management  and  the  conservation  of
America's wild turkey and its habitat; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the  National  Wild  Turkey  Federation  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating its 50th Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the National Wild Turkey Federation.
