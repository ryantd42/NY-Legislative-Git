  Museum's First Saturdays program
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  25th  Anniversary  of  the  Brooklyn  Museum's  First
Saturdays program; and
 
  WHEREAS, For twenty-five years, the Brooklyn Museum has  hosted  the
First Saturdays program, which are monthly evenings of free programming,
welcoming visitors from central Brooklyn and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This year's event schedule includes a variety of cultural,
educational,  and  social  programming,  including  Women's  History
Month/Gender Justice, National Poetry Month and the Fiftieth Anniversary
of Hip-Hop, Celebrating Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage, Pride,
Africa Fashion, Caribbean Heritage, Latinx Heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lauren Argentina Zelaya, the Director of Public Programs at
the  Brooklyn  Museum, called First Saturdays a love letter to Brooklyn,
noting that the events amplify the creative excellence  of  the  borough

the past 25 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate  the  25th  Anniversary  of  the  Brooklyn  Museum's  First
