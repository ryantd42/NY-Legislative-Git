 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to charter schools
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  New  York's  charter school law was
 enacted 14 years ago in an effort to create new  learning  opportunities
 for all students, to encourage different and innovative teaching methods
 and  to  provide  parents  and  students with expanded choice within the
 public schools. Fourteen years provides the state with  enough  informa-
 tion  to  make  judgments  about  changes  that are needed in the law to
 ensure the public knows how their tax dollars are  being  spent  and  to
 ensure  public  schools  serving  the  majority  of  students  have  the
 resources needed to provide a quality education to  all  students.  This
 legislation  is  intended to clarify the transparency and accountability
 of charter schools and provide fiscal relief  to  the  school  districts
 where charter schools are located.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 2851 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 101 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  An  application  to establish a charter school may be submitted by
 teachers, parents, school administrators,  community  residents  or  any
 combination  thereof.  Such application may be filed in conjunction with
 a college, university, museum, educational  institution,  not-for-profit
 corporation  exempt from taxation under paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of
 section 501 of the internal revenue  code  [or  for-profit  business  or
 corporate  entity  authorized to do business in New York state. Provided
 however, for-profit business or corporate entities shall not be eligible
 to submit an application to  establish  a  charter  school  pursuant  to
 subdivision  nine-a  of  section  twenty-eight hundred fifty-two of this
 article, or operate or manage a charter  school  for  a  charter  issued
 pursuant to subdivision nine-a of section twenty-eight hundred fifty-two
 of  this  article. For charter schools established in conjunction with a
 for-profit business or corporate entity, the charter shall  specify  the
 extent  of the entity's participation in the management and operation of

 the school], AND PROVIDED THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL AN  APPLICA-
 TION  TO  ESTABLISH  A  CHARTER  SCHOOL OR APPROVAL TO OPERATE A CHARTER
 SCHOOL BE GRANTED TO A FOR-PROFIT BUSINESS OR CORPORATE  ENTITY  AUTHOR-
 IZED  TO  DO  BUSINESS  IN THIS STATE NOR IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER SHALL
 THEY HAVE AN INVOLVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION  OF  A  CHARTER
 SCHOOL.  THE  APPLICATION SHALL INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF ANY MANAGEMENT FEE
 TO BE PAID TO ANY NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH
 THE APPLICANTS.  SALARIES OF THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPO-
 RATION MAY NOT EXCEED THE  SALARIES  FOR  COMPARABLE  POSITIONS  IN  THE
 SCHOOL DISTRICT OF LOCATION.

 STUDENTS  ON FREE LUNCH, STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE
 LEARNERS AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN WHICH THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS LOCATED.
  (h) The rules and procedures by which  students  may  be  disciplined,
 including  but  not  limited to expulsion or suspension from the school,

 EDUCATIONAL  SERVICES  TO  ANY STUDENT ON LONG TERM SUSPENSION OR EXPUL-
 SION.
  (p) The term of the proposed charter,  which  shall  not  exceed  five
 years  DURING WHICH INSTRUCTION IS PROVIDED TO PUPILS; provided however,
 in the case of charters issued pursuant to subdivision nine-a of section
 twenty-eight hundred fifty-two of this article the term of such proposed
 charter shall not exceed five years in which instruction is provided  to
 pupils plus the period commencing with the effective date of the charter
 and ending with the opening of the school for instruction.
  (v)  A  code  of  ethics for the charter school, setting forth for the
 guidance of its  trustees,  officers  and  employees  the  standards  of
 conduct  expected of them including standards with respect to disclosure
 of conflicts of interest regarding any matter brought before  the  board

  (d) in a school  district  where  the  total  enrollment  of  resident
 students attending charter schools in the base year is greater than five

 educational  benefit  to  the  students  expected to attend the proposed
 charter school [or (ii) the school district in which the charter  school

 Thereafter,  the  charter  entity shall resubmit the proposed charter to
 the board of regents with modifications,  provided  that  the  applicant
 consents in writing to such modifications, resubmit the proposed charter
 to  the  board  of regents without modifications WITH AN EXPLANATION WHY
 THE MODIFICATIONS ARE NOT BEING MADE, or abandon the  proposed  charter.
 The board of regents shall review each such resubmitted proposed charter
 in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subdivision  five-a  of  this
 section[; provided, however, that it shall be the duty of the  board  of
 regents to approve and issue a proposed charter resubmitted by the char-
 ter  entity  described  in paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section
 twenty-eight hundred fifty-one of this article within thirty days of the

  2.  Admissions;  enrollment; students.  (a) A charter school shall be
 nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment  practices,
 and  all other operations and shall not charge tuition or fees; provided
 that a charter school may require the payment of fees on the same  basis
 and  to  the same extent as other public schools. A charter school shall
 not discriminate against any student, employee or any  other  person  on
 the  basis  of  ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability or any
 other ground that would be unlawful if done by a  school.  Admission  of
 students  shall  not  be  limited  on the basis of intellectual ability,
 measures of achievement or aptitude, athletic ability, disability, race,
 creed, gender, national origin, religion, or ancestry; provided,  howev-
 er,  that  nothing  in  this  article  shall be construed to prevent the
 establishment of  a  single-sex  charter  school  or  a  charter  school
 designed to provide expanded learning opportunities for students at-risk
 of  academic  failure or students with disabilities and English language
 learners; and provided, further, that the charter school  shall  [demon-
 strate good faith efforts to] attract and retain a comparable or greater
 enrollment of students with disabilities, English language learners, and
 students  who  are  eligible  applicants  for the free and reduced price
 lunch program when compared to the enrollment figures for such  students
 in  the  school  district  in which the charter school is located.  IF A
 CHARTER SCHOOL IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING A COMPARABLE  OR  GREATER
 ENROLLMENT  OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT
 STUDENTS AS COMPARED TO THE ENROLLMENT FIGURES FOR SUCH STUDENTS IN  THE
 SCHOOL  DISTRICT  IN  WHICH  THE  CHARTER SCHOOL IS LOCATED SUCH CHARTER
 SCHOOL SHALL PROVIDE THE CHARTERING ENTITY WITH A PLAN FOR IMPROVING THE
 ENROLLMENT OF SUCH STUDENTS IN THE FOLLOWING  YEAR.  FAILURE  TO  COMPLY
 WITH  THIS  REQUIREMENT  FOR  TWO  CONSECUTIVE YEARS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO
 REVOCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBDIVISION ONE  OF  SECTION  TWENTY-EIGHT
 HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE. A charter shall not be issued to any
 school that would be wholly or in part under the control or direction of
 any  religious  denomination,  or  in  which any denominational tenet or
 doctrine would be taught.
  (b) Any child who is qualified under the laws of this state for admis-
 sion to a public school is qualified for admission to a charter  school.
 Applications  for  admission to a charter school shall be submitted on a
 uniform application form created by the department  and  shall  be  made
 available  by  a charter school in languages predominately spoken in the
 community in which such charter school  is  located.  The  school  shall
 enroll  each  eligible  student  who submits a timely application by the
 first day of April each year, unless the number of applications  exceeds
 the  capacity  of  the  grade level or building. In such cases, students
 shall be accepted from among applicants by a random  selection  process,
 provided,  however,  that  an enrollment preference shall be provided to
 pupils WHEN THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS LOCATED WITHIN ONE MILE OF THE PUPILS'
 RESIDENCE, PUPILS returning to the charter school in the second  or  any
 subsequent  year of operation and pupils residing in the school district
 in which the charter school is located, and siblings of  pupils  already
 enrolled  in the charter school AND STUDENTS ON FREE LUNCH, AND STUDENTS
 WITH DISABILITIES, AND STUDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.  Pref-
 erence  may  also  be  provided  to children of employees of the charter
 A. 3681  6
 
 school or charter management organization, provided that  such  children
 of  employees may constitute no more than fifteen percent of the charter
 school's total enrollment. The commissioner shall establish  regulations
 to  require that the random selection process conducted pursuant to this
 paragraph be performed in a transparent  and  equitable  manner  and  to
 require  that  the  time  and  place  of the random selection process be
 publicized in a manner consistent with the requirements of  section  one
 hundred  four  of the public officers law and be open to the public. For
 the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision,
 the  school  district in which the charter school is located shall mean,
 for the city school district of the city  of  New  York,  the  community
 district  in which the charter school is located.  THE CHARTER ENTITY IS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE SELECTION PROCESS IS CONDUCTED  IN  ACCORD-
 ANCE  WITH  THIS PARAGRAPH. IF THE CHARTER ENTITY DETERMINES THE PROCESS
 IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH  THIS  PARAGRAPH,  THE  CHARTER  ENTITY  SHALL
 CONDUCT THE PROCESS.
  (c) A charter school shall serve one or more of the grades one through
 twelve,  and  shall  limit  admission  to pupils within the grade levels
 served. Nothing herein shall prohibit a charter school from establishing
 a kindergarten program.
  (d) A student may withdraw from a  charter  school  at  any  time  and
 enroll in a public school. A CHARTER SCHOOL MUST PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE
 CHARTERING  ENTITY  EACH  YEAR INDICATING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS LEAVING
 THE CHARTER SCHOOL, THE MONTHS IN WHICH THE STUDENTS LEAVE  THE  SCHOOL,
 THE  REASON  THE STUDENTS LEAVE THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL THE STUDENT IS
 CURRENTLY ATTENDING. A  charter  school  may  refuse  admission  to  any
 student  who  has  been expelled or suspended from a public school until
 the period of  suspension  or  expulsion  from  the  public  school  has
 expired, consistent with the requirements of due process.
  § 15. Paragraphs (b-1), (c) and (c-1) of subdivision 3 of section 2854
 of  the  education  law, paragraph (b-1) as amended by section 6 of part
 D-2 of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007, and paragraphs (c) and  (c-1)  as
 added by chapter 4 of the laws of 1998, are amended to read as follows:
  (b-1) The employees of a charter school [that is not a conversion from
 an  existing  public  school] shall [not] be deemed members of [any] THE
 existing collective bargaining unit representing employees of the school
 district in which the charter school is located, and the charter  school
 and  its  employees  shall  [not]  be subject to any existing collective
 bargaining agreement between the  school  district  and  its  employees.
 [Provided,  however,  that  (i) if the student enrollment of the charter
 school on the first day on which the charter  school  commences  student
 instruction  exceeds  two  hundred fifty or if the average daily student
 enrollment of such school exceeds two  hundred  fifty  students  at  any
 point  during  the  first  two  years after the charter school commences
 student instruction, all employees of the school who  are  eligible  for
 representation  under article fourteen of the civil service law shall be
 deemed to be represented in a separate negotiating unit at  the  charter
 school  by  the same employee organization, if any, that represents like
 employees in the  school  district  in  which  such  charter  school  is
 located;  (ii)  the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph may
 be waived in up to ten charters issued  on  the  recommendation  of  the
 charter  entity  set  forth  in  paragraph  (b)  of subdivision three of
 section twenty-eight  hundred  fifty-one  of  this  article;  (iii)  the
 provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall not be applicable
 to  the  renewal  or  extension  of  a charter; and (iv) nothing in this
 sentence shall be construed to subject a charter school subject  to  the
 A. 3681  7

 provisions of this paragraph or its employees to any collective bargain-
 ing agreement between any public school district and its employees or to
 make  the  employees of such charter school part of any negotiating unit
 at such school district. The charter school may, in its sole discretion,
 choose  whether  or  not  to  offer the terms of any existing collective
 bargaining to school employees.] PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT A  MAJORITY  OF
 THE MEMBERS OF A NEGOTIATING UNIT WITHIN A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY MODIFY, IN
 WRITING,  A  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF EMPLOY-
 MENT IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
 THE CHARTER SCHOOL.
  (c) The employees of the charter school [may] SHALL be deemed  employ-
 ees of the local school district for the purpose of providing retirement
 benefits,  including  membership  in the teachers' retirement system and
 other retirement systems open to employees of public schools. The finan-
 cial contributions for such benefits shall be the responsibility of  the
 charter  school and the school's employees. The commissioner, in consul-
 tation with the comptroller, shall develop regulations to implement  the
 provisions  of this paragraph in a manner that allows charter schools to
 provide retirement benefits to its employees in the same manner as other
 public school employees.
  (c-1) Reasonable access. (i) If employees of the  charter  school  are
 not  represented,  any charter school chartered pursuant to this article
 must afford reasonable access to any employee  organization  during  the
 reasonable proximate period before any representation question is raised
 IN THE SAME MANNER AS ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYER; or
  (ii)  If  the  employee  organization  is  a challenging organization,
 reasonable access must be provided to any organization seeking to repre-
 sent employees beginning with a date reasonably proximate to a challenge
 period. Reasonableness is defined, at a minimum, as access equal to that
 provided to the incumbent organization.
  § 16. Subdivision 1 of section 2855 of the education law,  as  amended
 by chapter 101 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  The charter entity, or the board of regents, [may] SHALL terminate
 a charter upon any of the following grounds:
  (a) When a charter school's outcome  on  student  assessment  measures
 adopted  by  the board of regents falls below the level that would allow
 the commissioner to revoke the registration of  another  public  school,
 and student achievement on such measures [has not shown improvement] HAS
 NOT MET ANNUAL YEARLY PROGRESS over the preceding three school years;
  (b) Serious violations of law;
  (c)  Material  and  substantial  violation  of  the charter, including
 fiscal mismanagement AND FAILURE TO MEET STUDENT PERFORMANCE TARGETS;
  (d) When the public employment relations board makes  a  determination

 and  intentional  violations  of  subdivision one of section two hundred
 nine-a of the civil service law involving interference with or discrimi-
 nation against employee rights  under  article  fourteen  of  the  civil
 service law; [or]
  (e)  Repeated failure to comply with the requirement to meet or exceed
 enrollment and retention targets of students with disabilities,  English
 language learners, and students who are eligible applicants for the free
 and  reduced  price lunch program pursuant to targets established by the
 board of regents or the board of trustees of the state university of New
 York, as applicable. Provided, however, if no grounds for terminating  a
 charter  are established pursuant to this section other than pursuant to
 this paragraph, and the charter school demonstrates  that  it  has  made
 A. 3681  8
 
 extensive  efforts  to  recruit  and  retain  such  students,  including
 outreach to parents and families in the surrounding communities,  widely
 publicizing  the  lottery  for  such school, and efforts to academically
 support such students in such charter school, then the charter entity or
 board of regents may retain such charter[.]; OR
  (F)  FAILURE  TO ENROLL A COMPARABLE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING
 FOR FREE LUNCH, STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
 FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS.
  § 17. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 2856 of the  education
 law,  as  amended  by section 4 of part YYY of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2017, is amended and a new paragraph (a-1) is added to read as follows:
  (A-1) FOR THE  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE--TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR
 SCHOOL  YEAR  AND  EACH SCHOOL YEAR THEREAFTER THE STATE SHALL REIMBURSE
 SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE LOCAL  SHARE  OF  THE  CHARTER  SCHOOL  TUITION
 PAYMENT  OF  ANY STUDENTS ATTENDING A CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE JUNE PAYMENT
 REQUIRED BY SECTION THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINE-A OF  THIS  CHAPTER.
 SUCH  LOCAL  SHARE  SHALL  BE  CALCULATED  BY DEDUCTING FROM THE CHARTER
 SCHOOL TUITION PAYMENT THE PER PUPIL FOUNDATION AID AMOUNT  ATTRIBUTABLE
 TO SUCH PUPIL.
  (b)  The school district shall also pay directly to the charter school
 any federal or state aid attributable to a  student  with  a  disability
 attending charter school in proportion to the level of services for such
 student  with  a disability that the charter school provides directly or
 indirectly. Notwithstanding anything in this section  to  the  contrary,
 amounts  payable  pursuant to this subdivision from state or local funds
 may be reduced pursuant to an agreement between the school and the char-
 ter entity set forth in the charter.  Payments  made  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision  shall  be  made by the school district in six substantially
 equal installments each year beginning on the first business day of July
 and every two months thereafter. Amounts payable under this  subdivision
 shall  be  determined  by the commissioner. Amounts payable to a charter
 school in its first year of operation shall be based on the  projections
 of initial-year enrollment set forth in the charter until actual enroll-
 ment data is reported to the school district by the charter school. SUCH
 ACTUAL ENROLLMENT SHALL BE REPORTED TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PRIOR TO EACH
 PAYMENT  FOLLOWING  THE  INITIAL  JULY  PAYMENT  WHICH SHALL BE BASED ON
 PROJECTED ENROLLMENT. Such projections  shall  be  reconciled  with  the
 actual  enrollment  as  actual enrollment data is so reported and at the
 end of the school's first year of operation  and  each  subsequent  year
 based  on a final report of actual enrollment by the charter school, and
 any necessary adjustments resulting from such final report shall be made
 to payments during the school's following year of operation.
  § 18. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of  section  2857  of  the  education  law,
 subdivision  2  as amended and paragraph (a-1) of subdivision 3 as added

 AND  PROVIDED TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS LOCATED
 FOR DISPLAY ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WEBSITE, and shall be  made  publicly
 available  by  such  date  and  shall  be posted on the charter school's
 website. The annual report shall be in such form as shall be  prescribed
 by the commissioner and shall include at least the following components:

 ures  shall  include,  but  not be limited to, graduation rates, dropout
 rates,  performance  of students on standardized tests DISAGGREGATED FOR
 SUB-GROUPS, college entry rates, total spending per pupil  and  adminis-
 trative  spending  per  pupil.  Such  measures shall be presented in a
 format that is easily comparable to similar public schools. In addition,
 the charter school shall ensure that such information is easily accessi-
 ble to the community including making it publicly available by transmit-
 ting it to local newspapers of general circulation and making it  avail-
