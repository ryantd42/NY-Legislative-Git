 Introduced  by M. of A. GOODELL -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Social Services
 
 AN ACT to amend the  social  services  law,  in  relation  to  requiring
  participation in educational programs leading to a high school diploma
  or high school equivalency diploma for those seeking public assistance

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Purpose.  The legislature hereby finds  that  obtaining  a
 high school diploma or a high school equivalency diploma is often essen-
 tial  for  successful  private sector employment, and personal financial
 independence, self-sufficiency and  success.  Indeed,  many  occupations
 require  a  high  school diploma or high school equivalency diploma as a
 precondition for employment. Individuals without a high  school  diploma
 or  high  school  equivalency  diploma are often relegated to low paying
 jobs, and suffer much higher unemployment rates than those with  a  high
 school  diploma  or  high school equivalency diploma. It is therefore in
 the public interest to require individuals who are capable of  obtaining
 a  high  school diploma or high school equivalency diploma to be engaged
 in good faith efforts to obtain that objective.
  § 2. Section 131 of the social services law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 21 to read as follows:
  21. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER OR OTHER LAW TO THE
 CONTRARY, NO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHALL BE GIVEN TO OR FOR ANY PERSON  OVER
 FIVE  YEARS OF AGE OR UNDER THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHO DOES NOT HAVE A
 HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA OR IS NOT  DULY
 ENROLLED AND PARTICIPATING IN GOOD FAITH TOWARD THE ATTAINMENT OF A HIGH
 SCHOOL  DIPLOMA OR A HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA, UNLESS SUCH PERSON
 HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY  A  MEDICAL,  PSYCHIATRIC  OR  OTHER  APPROPRIATE
 PROFESSIONAL  TO  LACK  THE  REQUISITE CAPACITY TO COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY
 SUCH A COURSE OF STUDY OR THE LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT  DETERMINES
 THAT  SUCH A COURSE OF STUDY IS NOT PRACTICAL OR COST-EFFECTIVE BASED ON
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
