 section shall be construed as applying  to  persons  under  the  age  of
 sixteen who use a bicycle only to deliver daily newspapers or circulars.
  g. A business using a bicycle for commercial purposes shall be respon-
 sible  for  the  compliance with the provisions of this section [of] AND

 FORTY-TWO OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAW BY ITS BICYCLE OPERATORS, shall
 be  subject to a civil penalty of one hundred dollars. Any such business
 that violates a provision of this section or rule  promulgated  pursuant
 hereto  more  than  thirty days after such business has already violated
 the same provision or rule shall  be  subject  to  an  additional  civil
 penalty  of  two  hundred  fifty dollars. Such civil penalties may be in
 addition to any criminal  penalty  imposed,  and  shall  be  recoverable
 against  such business in an action or proceeding in any court or tribu-
