  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
honor  those  distinguished citizens of this great Empire State who have
devoted themselves to faithfully serving the  best  interests  of  their
community and the needs of its educators; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its

Teachers Federation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  graduating  from  East Rockaway High School on Long
Island, New York, Philip Rumore  studied  electronics  with  the  United
States  Air  Force;  he  furthered  his  education by earning bachelor's
degrees in physics and philosophy from the University at Buffalo; he has
always been fascinated  by  Einstein's  development  of  the  Theory  of
Relativity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Philip  Rumore  then  began his distinguished career as an
educator, teaching emotionally  disturbed  children  at  what  was  then

York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1981, Philip Rumore has held the distinguished  title
of  President  of  the 3,677 members of the Buffalo Teachers Federation,
the position from which he will officially retire on June 20, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his tenure, Philip  Rumore  has  been  a  strong
defender  of  public  education  and  has been dedicated to serving as a
voice  of  the  teachers  of  Buffalo  by  working  closely  with  12
superintendents  and  various  labor  relations  specialists  to discuss
important issues  relevant  to  them  and  negotiating  five  collective
bargaining agreements amongst many other issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Philip  Rumore  proudly  initiated  the  Buffalo  Teachers

  WHEREAS, In his capacity as President,  Philip  Rumore  served  with
loyalty, honor and distinction, truly earning the admiration, esteem and
affection  of  his  colleagues;  he  always  had his teachers' backs and
strived to make their working conditions  a  positive  and  enthusiastic
place for children to learn and to become the very best they can be; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  occurrence  of such a compassionate
blending of strength, leadership,  intellect,  and  commitment  as  that
 
demonstrated  by  Philip  Rumore  over  a  lifetime  of  sacrifice  and
dedication to others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Philip Rumore upon the occasion of his retirement,  and  to
