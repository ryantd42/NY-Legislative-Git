 Introduced  by  Sens.  PARKER,  BAILEY,  HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and
  ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on
  Local Government
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  county  law,  the  real  property  actions  and
  proceedings law, the vehicle and traffic law, the  state  finance  law
  and  the  judiciary  law, in relation to enacting the "NY Civil Gideon
  Act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York
 Civil Gideon act".
  § 2. The county law is amended by adding a new article 18-C to read as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 18-C
  REPRESENTATION OF PERSONS IN CIVIL MATTERS
 SECTION 723.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  723-A. CIVIL RIGHT TO COUNSEL COMMISSION.
  723-B. LEAD AGENCY FOR CIVIL RIGHT TO COUNSEL.
  723-C. ASSIGNED COUNSEL FOR CIVIL MATTERS REVIEW PANEL.
  723-D. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.
  § 723. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES
 AS FOLLOWS:
  1. EVERY YEAR, AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE CIVIL LEGAL NEEDS OF LOW
 INCOME NEW YORKERS GO UNMET.
  2. THESE LEGAL NEEDS OFTEN CONCERN MATTERS PERTAINING  TO  THE  ESSEN-
 TIALS  OF  LIFE  INCLUDING SHELTER, FOOD, EMPLOYMENT, HEALTH, AND FAMILY
 SUSTAINABILITY.
  3. THE LACK OF AVAILABLE CIVIL LEGAL ASSISTANCE UNDERMINES  COMPREHEN-
 SIVE ASSISTANCE FOR CRIME VICTIMS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
  LBD00995-01-3
 S. 4689  2

  4.  THE LACK OF CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES TO RESOLVE A FAMILY'S LEGAL PROB-
 LEMS OFTEN DISRUPTS THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS' EDUCATION, FREQUENTLY
 WITH A PERMANENT IMPACT.
  5. THE LACK OF CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES CAN WORSEN CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS
 OFTEN INCREASING THE COST OF MEDICAL CARE.
  6.  THE  LACK  OF  CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES CAN RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS NOT
 ONLY AFFECTING THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES  BUT  ALSO  DESTABILIZING  ENTIRE
 NEIGHBORHOODS.
  7.  IN  LIGHT OF THESE TRYING ECONOMIC TIMES, THE NEED FOR CIVIL LEGAL
 SERVICES HAS INCREASED BEYOND  INDIVIDUALS  BELOW  THE  FEDERAL  POVERTY
 GUIDELINES  TO  HOMEOWNERS  AND  OTHER  MIDDLE  INCOME  NEW YORKERS THAT
 PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW YORK'S ECONOMY.
  8. THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS  IN  CIVIL  LEGAL
 MATTERS  ADVERSELY IMPACTS THE QUALITY OF JUSTICE FOR ALL PARTIES IN THE
 COURTS OF NEW YORK STATE, INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, AND UNDER-
 MINES THE RULE OF LAW.
  9. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT WHEN A SOCIETY IS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC
 HUMAN NEEDS IT IS IN AN ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY.
  10. THE UNMET  NEED  FOR  CIVIL  LEGAL  ASSISTANCE  IN  THE  STATE  IS
 PROFOUNDLY  IMPACTING  VULNERABLE  NEW  YORKERS  AND  COSTING  TAXPAYERS
 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  BY  INCREASING  HOMELESSNESS,  FAILING  TO  PREVENT
 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND INCREASING POVERTY.
  11.  IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS EMERGENCY, THIS LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT A
 RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN CERTAIN CIVIL MATTERS IS IMPERATIVE.

 LISHED  THE  CIVIL RIGHT TO COUNSEL COMMISSION.  THE COMMISSION SHALL BE

  5. TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THE FUNDING AVAILABLE, THE LEAD
 LEGAL SERVICES AGENCY SHALL SERVE AS A HUB FOR ALL  REFERRALS,  AND  THE
 POINT  AT  WHICH DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT WHICH REFERRALS WILL BE SERVED
 AND BY WHOM. REFERRALS SHALL EMANATE FROM THE COURT, AS WELL AS FROM THE
 OTHER  AGENCIES  PROVIDING  SERVICES  THROUGH  THE PROGRAM, AND SHALL BE
 DIRECTED TO THE LEAD LEGAL SERVICES AGENCY FOR REVIEW. THAT  AGENCY,  OR
 ANOTHER  AGENCY  OR ATTORNEY IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT, SHALL COLLECT THE
 INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CASE SHOULD  BE  SERVED.  IN
 PERFORMING THAT CASE ASSESSMENT, THE AGENCY SHALL DETERMINE THE RELATIVE
 NEED FOR REPRESENTATION OF THE LITIGANT, INCLUDING ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:

 FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE.
  7. IF BOTH PARTIES TO A DISPUTE ARE FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR REPRESEN-
 TATION, EACH PROPOSAL SHALL ENSURE THAT REPRESENTATION FOR BOTH SIDES IS
 EVALUATED.  IN THESE AND OTHER CASES IN WHICH CONFLICT ISSUES ARISE, THE
 LEAD LEGAL SERVICES AGENCY SHALL  HAVE  REFERRAL  PROTOCOLS  WITH  OTHER
 AGENCIES  AND  PROVIDERS,  SUCH  AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY PANEL, TO ADDRESS
 THOSE CONFLICTS.
  8. EACH LEAD AGENCY, ORGANIZATION, OR ATTORNEY  SHALL  BE  RESPONSIBLE
 FOR KEEPING RECORDS ON THE REFERRALS ACCEPTED AND THOSE NOT ACCEPTED FOR
 REPRESENTATION,  AND  THE  REASONS  FOR  EACH, IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT
 VIOLATE  ANY  PRIVILEGED  COMMUNICATIONS  BETWEEN  THE  AGENCY  AND  THE
 PROSPECTIVE  CLIENT. EACH LEAD AGENCY, ORGANIZATION OR ATTORNEY SHALL BE
 PROVIDED WITH STANDARDIZED DATA COLLECTION TOOLS TO BE DETERMINED BY THE
 COMMISSION, AND REQUIRED TO TRACK CASE INFORMATION FOR EACH REFERRAL  TO
 ALLOW THE EVALUATION TO MEASURE THE NUMBER OF CASES SERVED, THE LEVEL OF
 SERVICE  REQUIRED,  AND  THE  OUTCOMES  FOR THE CLIENTS IN EACH CASE. IN
 ADDITION TO THIS INFORMATION ON THE EFFECT OF THE REPRESENTATION ON  THE
 CLIENTS,  DATA  SHALL  BE COLLECTED REGARDING THE OUTCOMES FOR THE TRIAL
 COURTS. THIS DATA SHALL BE COMPILED IN A REPORT TO BE SUBMITTED  TO  THE

  §  4.  Subdivision  3 of section 1303 of the real property actions and
 proceedings law, as amended by section 5 of part Q of chapter 73 of  the
 laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  The  notice to any mortgagor required by paragraph (a) of subdivi-
 sion one of this section shall appear as follows:
  Help for Homeowners in Foreclosure
  New York State Law requires that we send you  this  notice  about  the
 foreclosure process. Please read it carefully.
 Summons and Complaint
  You  are  in danger of losing your home. If you fail to respond to the
 summons and complaint in this foreclosure  action,  you  may  lose  your
 home.  Please read the summons and complaint carefully. You should imme-
 diately contact an attorney or your local legal  aid  office  to  obtain
 advice on how to protect yourself.
 Sources of Information and Assistance
 S. 4689  9
 
  The  State  encourages  you  to  become informed about your options in
 foreclosure. In addition to seeking assistance from an attorney or legal
 aid office, there are government agencies and  non-profit  organizations
 that  you  may contact for information about possible options, including
 trying  to  work with your lender during this process.  YOU MAY BE ENTI-
 TLED TO ASSIGNED COUNSEL IF YOU ARE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO OBTAIN  REPRE-
 SENTATION.
  To  locate  an  entity  near  you, you may call the toll-free helpline
 maintained by the New York State Department  of  Financial  Services  at
 (enter number) or visit the Department's website at (enter web address).
  Rights and Obligations
 YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME AT THIS TIME. You have the right
 to  stay  in  your  home  during  the  foreclosure  process. You are not
 required to leave your home unless and until your property  is  sold  at
 auction pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure and sale.
 Regardless  of  whether  you  choose  to  remain  in  your home, YOU ARE
 REQUIRED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PROPERTY and pay property taxes in accord-
 ance with state and local law.
 Foreclosure rescue scams
  Be careful of people who approach you with offers to "save" your home.
 There are individuals who watch for notices of  foreclosure  actions  in
 order  to  unfairly  profit  from  a homeowner's distress. You should be
 extremely careful about any such promises and any suggestions  that  you
 pay  them a fee or sign over your deed. State law requires anyone offer-
 ing such services for profit  to  enter  into  a  contract  which  fully
 describes  the services they will perform and fees they will charge, and
 which prohibits them from taking any money  from  you  until  they  have
 completed all such promised services.
  §  5. Section 722-c of the county law, as amended by section 3 of part
 J of chapter 62 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read as follows:
  § 722-c. Services other than counsel. Upon a finding in  an  ex  parte
