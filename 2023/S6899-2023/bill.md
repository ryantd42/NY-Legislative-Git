 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public service law, in relation to enacting the
  "state and local clean energy partnership"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "state and local clean energy partnership".
  § 2. Legislative findings and statement of  purpose.  The  legislature
 hereby finds, determines and declares:
  1.  In  April 2016, the New York state public service commission ("the
 commission") adopted a CCA Framework Order in Commission Case  14-M-0224
 which  authorized  towns,  villages and cities in New York state to form
 opt-out Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA") Programs.
  2. CCA programs allow municipalities, alone or jointly, to enact local
 laws giving themselves the  requisite  legal  authority  to  enter  into
 competitively-procured  contracts with one or more energy service compa-
 nies in order to act as an aggregator and broker for the sale  of  elec-
 tric  supply,  gas supply, and/or other energy services, to residents of
 that municipality wherein all customers, including residential and  non-
 residential,  are  eligible to participate in the program and shall have
 the option to opt out of participating if desired.
  3. Well-designed CCA programs can empower communities to take  control
 of their energy future; encourage and expand opportunities for customers
 to access Community Distributed Generation ("CDG") programs, particular-
 ly for low- to moderate-income households and renters who may not other-
 wise  have  access  to solar energy; and educate and encourage community
 engagement in energy programs.
  4. Since the adoption of the CCA Framework Order,  CCA  programs  have
 demonstrated  their  potential  as a tool for facilitating engagement by

 communities and retail customers in taking charge of their energy choic-
 es, securing  competitive  energy  contracts  on  behalf  of  aggregated
 customers,  financially  supporting  the current renewable market and in
 growing the renewable market in New York.
  5.  This  act  is intended to signal the state's continuing support of
 CCA; to recognize the vibrant market created by CCA and  the  tremendous
 progress  achieved  by  those programs in encouraging residential demand
 for renewables and community  participation  in  making  energy  choices
 locally;  to recognize CCA as offering significant new opportunities for
 the state to advance the Climate Act  at  the  municipal  and  community
 level;  and  to  provide  clarity  and confidence necessary to allow the
 commission to expeditiously advance broader deployment  of  CCA  and  to
 incorporate opt-out CDG as part of the CCA framework.
  6.  Moreover,  this  act  is  intended  to level the playing field for
 communities seeking to participate in CCA, to ensure that opt-out CDG is
 authorized within the CCA framework, and to promote fairness  and  equal
 opportunity  for  communities  across  the state to innovate and advance
 Climate Act goals.
  7. Chapter 106 of the laws of 2019 enacted the New York State  climate
 leadership  and community protection act (the "Climate Act") which among
 other things:
  a. Directed the department of environmental conservation to  establish
 statewide  greenhouse gas emissions limits as a percentage of 1990 emis-
 sions as follows: (i) 2020: 60% of 1990 emissions; and (ii) 2050: 15% of
 1990 emissions;
  b. Directed the commission to establish programs  to  require  that  a
 minimum  of  70%  statewide electric generation be produced by renewable
 energy systems by 2030, and that by the year 2040  the  statewide  elec-
 trical demand system will generate zero emissions;
  c.  Directed  the  New  York Climate Justice Working Group to identify
 Disadvantaged Communities which are often overlooked in  climate  policy
 initiatives and to ensure they directly benefit from the State's transi-
 tion to cleaner, greener sources of energy, reduced pollution and clean-
 er air, and economic opportunities created by or in conjunction with the
 Climate Act; and
  d.  Directed  that  Disadvantaged  Communities receive a minimum of 35
 percent (with a goal of 40%) of benefits of investments in clean  energy
 and  energy  efficiency  programs  or  projects in the areas of housing,
 workforce development, pollution  reduction,  low-  and  moderate-income
 energy assistance, energy, transportation, and economic development.
  8. Decisions made by New Yorkers and their communities regarding their
 energy  usage  and  purchasing  significantly  impact the ability of the
 State to achieve the Climate Act's goals and to encourage the deployment
 of distributed energy resources.
  9. Moreover, empowering communities to take control  of  their  energy
 future  through  CCA,  and  to  choose and encourage local deployment of
 renewable energy through opt-out CDG, advances the goals of the  Climate
 Act  at  the local level, encourages local participation in State energy
 initiatives such as the Reforming the Energy Vision, Clean Energy Stand-
 ard, and Climate Act, sends appropriate market signals to drive  invest-
 ment  and  innovation  in  New  York's  energy markets, empowers munici-
 palities to make long-term planning and investment decisions related  to
 energy  opportunities,  and promotes equity and environmental justice by
 leveraging community-level buying power and aggregated  customer  demand
 to  ensure access to CDG credits and other CCA program benefits for low-
 and moderate-income New Yorkers in participating communities.
 S. 6899  3
 
  10. The Climate Act reaffirms  the  State's  commitment  to  advancing
 social  and environmental equity, and righting past environmental injus-
 tices; this act furthers those commitments by ensuring equal  access  to
 CCA  among historically marginalized communities and prioritizes low-in-
 come  customers  to benefit first from opt-out CDG crediting programs to
 lower their energy bills.
  11. A public policy purpose would be served and the interests  of  the
 people  of  the  state  would  be  advanced by codifying the State's CCA
 programs in law, directing  the  commission  to  streamline  review  and
 approval  of  CCA  programs  consistent with this enactment, encouraging
 community participation in CCA, authorizing CCA  programs  to  integrate
 opt-out CDG into their offerings, and prioritizing access to opt-out CDG
 in Disadvantaged Communities.
