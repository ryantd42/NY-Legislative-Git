 AN ACT to amend the judiciary law, in relation to  the  compensation  of
  persons who serve as jurors

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 519 of the judiciary law, as added by chapter 85 of
 the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  § 519. Right of juror to be absent from employment. Any person who  is
 summoned  to  serve  as a juror under the provisions of this article and
 who notifies [his or her] SUCH PERSON'S employer to that effect prior to
 the commencement of a term of service shall not, on account  of  absence
 from  employment by reason of such jury service, be subject to discharge
 or penalty. An employer may, however, withhold wages of any such employ-
 ee serving as a juror during the period of such service;  provided  that
 an  employer  who employs more than ten employees shall not withhold the
 first [forty] FIFTY dollars of such juror's daily wages during the first
 three days of jury service. Withholding of wages in accordance with this
 section shall not be deemed a penalty. Violation of this  section  shall
 constitute  a  criminal contempt of court punishable pursuant to section
 seven hundred fifty of this chapter.
  § 2. Subdivision (a) of section 521 of the judiciary law,  as  amended
 by chapter 302 of the laws of 2002, is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  Except  as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, trial and
 grand jurors in each court of the unified court system shall be entitled
 to an allowance equal to the sum of [forty] FIFTY dollars  per  day  for
 each  and  every  day of physical attendance wherein the court convenes,
 except that no person who is employed shall be entitled to receive  such
 allowance if, pursuant to section five hundred nineteen of this article,
 [his  or  her] SUCH PERSON'S employer is prohibited from withholding the

 first [forty] FIFTY dollars of wages of such person during  such  period
 and  such person's daily wages equal or exceed [forty] FIFTY dollars. If
 such person's daily wages are less than [forty] FIFTY  dollars,  [he  or
 she]  SUCH  PERSON  shall  be entitled to receive an allowance hereunder
 equal to the difference between [forty] FIFTY dollars and the amount  of
 [his  or  her]  SUCH  PERSON'S daily wages. Such fees and those expenses
 actually and necessarily incurred in  providing  food  and  lodging  for
 jurors  shall be a state charge payable out of funds appropriated to the
 office of court administration for that purpose.
  § 3. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
