  HONORING Firefighter Joseph Raio upon the occasion
  of  his designation for special recognition after 40
  years of dedicated service to the Floral Park Centre
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  Firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Joseph Raio upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition
after  40  years  of  dedicated  service  to the Floral Park Centre Fire
Department to be celebrated at the Installation Dinner to be held at the
Inn in New Hyde Park, New York, on Saturday, April 29, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Joseph Raio joined the Floral Park Centre  Fire  Department
four  decades  ago;  in  addition,  he  has been an active member of the
department and served on the Executive Board of  commissioners  for  the
past 15 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Joseph Raio is one such firefighter;  throughout  40  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Joseph Raio upon the occasion of his  designation  for
special  recognition  after  40 years of dedicated service to the Floral
Park Centre Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Joseph Raio.
