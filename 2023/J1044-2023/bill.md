  CONGRATULATING  Bremer's  Wine  and  Liquor of New
  Hartford, New York, upon the occasion of celebrating
  its 90th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
celebrate  the  achievements  of  those  individuals and businesses that
substantially contribute to the economic vitality of  their  communities
and the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  Bremer's  Wine  and Liquor of New Hartford, New York, upon
the occasion of its 90th Anniversary to  be  celebrated  at  a  Customer
Appreciation  Event on Friday, June 9, 2023, at the Yahnundasis Golf and
Country Club in New Hartford; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bremer's Wine and Liquor was originally started as  the  CH
Bremer Fish and Fruit Market by Charles Bremer on Seneca Street in Utica
in  1876; Charles passed the store onto his son Merritt who obtained the
first liquor license from Oneida County after the repeal of Prohibition,
and the store began to sell wine and liquor on June 13, 1933; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1959, Merritt Bremer  died  unexpectedly  and  his  son,
Merritt  Jr.  (Bud),  took  a  leave from his job as a chemist at United
Merchants and Manufacturers to help; he thought it would be a brief  few
weeks  of managing the store, however he ultimately remained at the helm
for several decades; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1966, the Bremer  business  merged  with  Art  Bullock's
store, Casey and Keefe, becoming Bremer and Bullock; after Art Bullock's
retirement in 1999, Bud Bremer's son Merritt III (Tim) joined his father
in  the  store,  and in 2006, Eric, the youngest of the Bremers, came on
board so his father could ease into retirement;  in  2022,  Eric  Bremer
became the sole proprietor of Bremer's Wine and Liquor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the last nine decades, the business has served
its clientele from five  sites,  from  downtown  Utica  to  its  current
location  on  Commercial  Drive  in  New  Hartford;  over the years, the
business  has  given  back  to  the  Mohawk  Valley  by  supporting
not-for-profit  organizations  including  The Arthritis Foundation, Thea
Bowman House, The House of the Good Shepherd, The Boys and  Girls  Club,
and the American Heart Association; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Bremer's  Wine  and  Liquor is in direct
correlation to the efforts of  its  staff,  whose  involvement  is,  and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  business  and  its contributions to the
local and State economies, fully confident  that  it  will  continue  to
 
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Bremer's Wine and Liquor of New Hartford,  New  York,  upon
the occasion of celebrating its 90th Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Eric Bremer, Owner/Operator, Bremer's Wine and Liquor.
