 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation  to  eligibility
  for conviction sealing for certain applicants
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 160.59 of the criminal procedure law, as  added  by
 section  48  of part WWW of chapter 59 of the laws of 2017 and paragraph
 (a) of subdivision 2 and subdivision 11 as amended by chapter 60 of  the
 laws of 2017, is amended to read as follows:
 § 160.59 Sealing of certain convictions.
  1.  Definitions:  As  used  in this section, the following terms shall
 have the following meanings:
  (a) "Eligible offense" shall mean A VIOLATION OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF
 SECTION  ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAW OR any
 crime defined in the laws of this state other than a sex offense defined
 in article one hundred thirty of the penal law, an  offense  defined  in
 article  two  hundred  sixty-three  of  the  penal law, a felony offense
 defined in article one hundred twenty-five of the penal law,  a  violent
 felony  offense  defined  in  section  70.02 of the penal law, a class A
 felony offense defined in the penal law, a  felony  offense  defined  in
 article  one  hundred five of the penal law where the underlying offense
 is not an eligible offense, an attempt to commit an offense that is  not
 an  eligible offense if the attempt is a felony, or an offense for which
 registration as a sex offender is required pursuant to article six-C  of
 the  correction  law.  For  the  purposes  of  this section, where the
 [defendant] APPLICANT is convicted of more than  one  eligible  offense,
 [committed as part of the same criminal transaction as defined in subdi-
 vision  two  of  section  40.10 of this chapter, those offenses shall be
 considered one eligible offense] CHARGED IN MORE THAN ONE COUNT  IN  THE
 SAME  INDICTMENT,  INFORMATION  OR COMPLAINT, OR WHERE THE APPLICANT WAS
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 3046  2
 
 CONVICTED OF MORE THAN ONE ELIGIBLE OFFENSE CHARGED IN MULTIPLE  INDICT-
 MENTS,  INFORMATIONS  OR COMPLAINTS FILED IN THE SAME COURT PRIOR TO THE
 ENTRY  OF  JUDGMENT  ON  ANY  OF  SUCH  INDICTMENTS,  INFORMATIONS  OR
 COMPLAINTS, ALL SUCH OFFENSES SHALL BE CONSIDERED ONE ELIGIBLE OFFENSE.
  (b)  "Sentencing  judge"  shall mean the judge who pronounced sentence
 upon the conviction under consideration, or if that judge is  no  longer
 sitting  in  a  court  in  the  jurisdiction in which the conviction was
 obtained, any other judge who is sitting in the criminal court where the
 judgment of conviction was entered.
  (C) "PROSECUTOR" SHALL MEAN THE PROSECUTOR'S  OFFICE  THAT  PROSECUTED
 THE ELIGIBLE OFFENSE.
  1-a.  The chief administrator of the courts shall, pursuant to section
 10.40 of this chapter, prescribe a form application which may be used by
 a defendant to apply for sealing pursuant to  this  section.  Such  form
 application  shall  include  all the essential elements required by this
 section to be included in an application for sealing.  Nothing  in  this
 subdivision shall be read to require a defendant to use such form appli-
 cation to apply for sealing.
  2.  (a)  [A  defendant]  AN INDIVIDUAL who has been convicted of up to
 [two] FIVE eligible CRIMINAL offenses but not more than [one] TWO felony
 [offense] OFFENSES may apply to  the  court  in  which  he  or  she  was
 convicted  of  the most serious ELIGIBLE offense to have such conviction
 or convictions sealed. If all offenses are offenses with the same  clas-
 sification,  the  application  shall  be  made to the court in which the
 [defendant] APPLICANT was last convicted.
  (b) An application shall contain (i) a copy of a certificate of dispo-
 sition or other similar documentation for  any  offense  for  which  the
 [defendant]  APPLICANT has been convicted, or an explanation of why such
 certificate or other documentation is not available; (ii) a sworn state-
 ment of the [defendant] APPLICANT as to whether he or she has filed,  or
 then  intends to file, any application for sealing of any other eligible
 offense; (iii) a copy of any other such application that has been filed;
 AND (iv) a sworn statement as to the conviction or convictions for which
 relief is being sought[; and (v)]. APPLICANTS MAY SUBMIT a sworn  state-
 ment  of  the reason or reasons why the court should, in its discretion,
 grant such sealing, along with any supporting documentation.
  (c) A copy of any application for such sealing shall  be  served  upon
 the  [district  attorney  of  the county in which the conviction, or, if
 more than one, the convictions, was or were  obtained]  PROSECUTOR  THAT
 PROSECUTED  THE  ELIGIBLE  OFFENSE  FOR WHICH A CONVICTION WAS OBTAINED.
 The [district attorney] PROSECUTOR shall notify the court within  forty-
 five  days  if he or she objects to the application for sealing. FAILURE
 TO OBJECT WITHIN THIS PERIOD SHALL INDICATE CONSENT TO THE APPLICATION.
  (d) When such application  is  filed  with  the  court,  it  shall  be
 assigned  to  the  sentencing  judge unless more than one application is
 filed in which case the application  shall  be  assigned  to  the  LOCAL
 COURT,  county  court  or  the  supreme court of the county in which the
 criminal court is located, who shall request and receive from the  divi-
 sion  of  criminal justice services a fingerprint based criminal history
 record of the [defendant] APPLICANT, including any sealed or  suppressed
 records.  The division of criminal justice services also shall include a
 criminal history report, if any, from the  federal  bureau  of  investi-
 gation regarding any criminal history information that occurred in other
 jurisdictions.  The division is hereby authorized to receive such infor-
 mation from the federal bureau of investigation for this purpose, and to
 S. 3046  3
 
 make such information available to the court, which may make this infor-
 mation available to the district attorney and the [defendant] APPLICANT.
  3.  The  sentencing  judge,  or  LOCAL,  county or supreme court shall
 summarily deny the [defendant's] APPLICANT'S application when:
  (a) the [defendant] APPLICANT is required to register as a sex  offen-
 der pursuant to article six-C of the correction law; or
  (b)  the  [defendant] APPLICANT has previously obtained sealing of the
 maximum number of convictions allowable under  section  160.58  of  [the
 criminal procedure law] THIS ARTICLE; or
  (c)  the  [defendant] APPLICANT has previously obtained sealing of the
 maximum number of convictions allowable under subdivision four  of  this
 section; or
  (d)  the time period specified in subdivision five of this section has
 not yet been satisfied; or
  (e) the [defendant] APPLICANT has an undisposed arrest or charge pend-
 ing; or
  (f) the [defendant] APPLICANT was convicted of any crime THAT  IS  NOT
 ELIGIBLE  FOR  SEALING UNDER THIS SECTION after the date of the entry of
 [judgement] JUDGMENT of the last conviction for which sealing is sought;
 or
  (g) [the defendant has failed to provide the court with  the  required
 sworn  statement  of  the  reasons why the court should grant the relief
 requested; or
  (h)] the [defendant] APPLICANT has been convicted of  [two]  THREE  or
 more felonies or more than [two] FIVE crimes.
  4.  Provided  that  the  application  is  not summarily denied for the
 reasons set forth in subdivision three of this section, [a defendant] AN
 APPLICANT who stands convicted of up to  [two]  FIVE  eligible  CRIMINAL
 offenses[,]  may  obtain  sealing  of  A VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAW AND  no
 more than [two] FIVE eligible offenses but not more than [one] TWO felo-
 ny [offense] OFFENSES.
  5.  Any  eligible offense may be sealed only after [at least ten years
 have passed since the imposition of  the  sentence  on  the  defendant's
 latest  conviction  or,  if  the  defendant was sentenced to a period of
 incarceration, including a period of incarceration imposed  in  conjunc-
 tion  with  a sentence of probation, the defendant's latest release from
 incarceration. In calculating the ten year period  under  this  subdivi-
 sion,  any  period  of  time  the defendant spent incarcerated after the
 conviction for which the application for sealing  is  sought,  shall  be
 excluded and such ten year period shall be extended by a period or peri-
 ods equal to the time served under such incarceration.]:
  (A)  AT LEAST ONE YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE THE DATE OF APPLICANT'S LATEST
 CONVICTION IF THE APPLICANT WAS  LAST  CONVICTED  OF  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR
 VIOLATION  OFFENSE.  IN CALCULATING THIS PERIOD, ANY PERIOD OF TIME THE
 APPLICANT SPENT INCARCERATED FOR THIS CONVICTION, INCLUDING A PERIOD  OF
 INCARCERATION IMPOSED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A SENTENCE OF PROBATION, SHALL
 BE EXCLUDED AND SUCH ONE YEAR PERIOD SHALL BE EXTENDED BY A PERIOD EQUAL
 TO THE TIME SERVED UNDER SUCH INCARCERATION; OR
  (B)  AT  LEAST  THREE  YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE DATE OF APPLICANT'S
 LATEST CONVICTION IF THE  APPLICANT  WAS  LAST  CONVICTED  OF  A  FELONY
 OFFENSE.  IN CALCULATING THIS PERIOD, ANY PERIOD OF TIME THE APPLICANT
 SPENT INCARCERATED FOR THIS CONVICTION, INCLUDING A PERIOD OF INCARCERA-
 TION IMPOSED IN CONJUNCTION WITH  A  SENTENCE  OF  PROBATION,  SHALL  BE
 EXCLUDED  AND SUCH THREE YEAR PERIOD SHALL BE EXTENDED BY A PERIOD EQUAL
 TO THE TIME SERVED UNDER SUCH INCARCERATION.
 S. 3046  4
 
  6. Upon determining that the application is not subject  to  mandatory
 denial pursuant to subdivision three of this section and that the appli-
 cation  is opposed by the [district attorney] PROSECUTOR, the sentencing
 judge or LOCAL, county or supreme court shall [conduct a hearing on  the
 application  in  order  to consider any evidence offered by either party
 that would aid the sentencing judge in his or her  decision  whether  to
 seal  the records of the defendant's convictions. No hearing is required
 if the district attorney does not oppose  the  application]  INFORM  THE
 APPLICANT OF HIS OR HER RIGHT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR APPLICATION WITH ADDI-
 TIONAL MATERIALS THAT WOULD AID THE SENTENCING JUDGE IN HIS OR HER DECI-
 SION  OR  TO A HEARING ON THE APPLICATION IN ORDER TO CONSIDER ARGUMENTS
 BY EITHER PARTY THAT WOULD AID THE SENTENCING JUDGE IN HIS OR HER  DECI-
 SION.  ONCE THE APPLICANT INDICATES WHETHER HE OR SHE INTENDS TO PROCEED
 WITH OR WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTATION OR A HEARING, THE  SENTENCING  JUDGE  OR
 LOCAL, COUNTY OR SUPREME COURT, MAY PROCEED.
  7. [In considering any such application, the sentencing judge or coun-
 ty  or  supreme court shall consider any relevant factors, including but
 not limited to:
  (a) the amount of time that has elapsed  since  the  defendant's  last
 conviction;
  (b)  the  circumstances  and  seriousness of the offense for which the
 defendant is seeking relief, including whether the arrest charge was not
 an eligible offense;
  (c) the circumstances and seriousness of any other offenses for  which
 the defendant stands convicted;
  (d)  the  character  of the defendant, including any measures that the
 defendant has taken toward  rehabilitation,  such  as  participating  in
 treatment  programs,  work, or schooling, and participating in community
 service or other volunteer programs;
  (e) any statements made by the victim of the  offense  for  which  the
 defendant is seeking relief;
  (f) the impact of sealing the defendant's record upon his or her reha-
 bilitation  and  upon  his  or her successful and productive reentry and
 reintegration into society; and
  (g) the impact of sealing the defendant's record on public safety  and
 upon  the public's confidence in and respect for the law] UPON DETERMIN-
 ING THAT THE APPLICATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY DENIAL PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION, THE SENTENCING JUDGE OR LOCAL, COUNTY
 OR  SUPREME  COURT  SHALL  ORDER SEALING, UNLESS THE PROSECUTOR SHOWS BY
 CLEAR AND  CONVINCING  EVIDENCE  THAT  EXCEPTIONAL  CIRCUMSTANCES  WEIGH
 AGAINST  SUCH  RELIEF.  IN DETERMINING WHETHER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
 EXIST THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER IF THE SEALING WOULD CREATE AN  UNREASON-
 ABLE  RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY, BALANCED AGAINST THE BENEFIT OF SEALING THE
 RECORD UPON THE APPLICANT'S SUCCESSFUL AND PRODUCTIVE REENTRY AND  REIN-
 TEGRATION INTO SOCIETY.
  8.  When  a  sentencing judge or LOCAL, county or supreme court orders
 sealing pursuant to this  section,  all  official  records  and  papers,
 INCLUDING  JUDGMENTS  AND  ORDERS OF A COURT BUT NOT INCLUDING PUBLISHED
 COURT DECISIONS OR OPINIONS OR RECORDS AND BRIEFS ON APPEAL, relating to
 the arrests, prosecutions, and convictions, including all duplicates and
 copies thereof, on file with the division of criminal  justice  services
 or  any  court, POLICE AGENCY OR PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE shall be sealed and
 not made available to any person or public or private agency  except  as
 provided for in subdivision nine of this section; provided, however, the
 division  shall  retain any fingerprints, palmprints and photographs, or
 digital images of the same.  The clerk of such court  shall  immediately
 S. 3046  5
 
 notify  the  commissioner  of the division of criminal justice services,
 THE HEADS OF ALL APPROPRIATE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER  LAW  ENFORCE-
 MENT  AGENCIES,  regarding  the records that shall be sealed pursuant to
 this  section.  The  clerk  also  shall  notify  any  court in which the
 [defendant] APPLICANT has stated, pursuant to paragraph (b) of  subdivi-
 sion two of this section, that he or she has filed or intends to file an
 application for sealing of any other eligible offense.
  9. Records sealed pursuant to this section shall be made available to:
  (a)  the [defendant] APPLICANT or the [defendant's] APPLICANT'S desig-
 nated agent;
  (b) qualified agencies, as defined  in  subdivision  nine  of  section
 eight  hundred  thirty-five  of the executive law, and federal and state
 law enforcement agencies, when acting within  the  scope  of  their  law
 enforcement duties; or
  (c)  any  state or local officer or agency with responsibility for the
 issuance of licenses to possess guns, when the person has made  applica-
 tion for such a license; or
  (d)  any  prospective employer of a police officer or peace officer as
 those terms are defined in subdivisions thirty-three and thirty-four  of
 section  1.20 of this chapter, in relation to an application for employ-
 ment as a police officer or peace officer; provided, however, that every
 person who is an applicant for the position of police officer  or  peace
 officer  shall  be  furnished  with a copy of all records obtained under
 this paragraph and afforded an opportunity to make an explanation there-
 to; or
  (e) the criminal justice information services division of the  federal
 bureau  of  investigation,  for the purposes of responding to queries to
 the national instant criminal background check system regarding attempts
 to purchase or otherwise take possession of firearms, as defined  in  18
 USC 921 (a) (3).
  10. [A conviction which is sealed pursuant to this section is included
 within  the  definition of a conviction for the purposes of any criminal
 proceeding in which the fact of  a  prior  conviction  would  enhance  a
 penalty or is an element of the offense charged.
  11.]  No [defendant] APPLICANT shall be required or permitted to waive
 eligibility for sealing pursuant to this section as part of  a  plea  of
 guilty,  sentence or any agreement related to a conviction for an eligi-
 ble offense and any such waiver shall be deemed void  and  wholly  unen-
 forceable.
  11.  DENIAL  UNDER  THIS  SECTION  IS  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SUBSEQUENT
 RELIEF UNDER THIS SECTION.
  12. AN APPLICATION UNDER THIS SECTION, AND ALL  PERTINENT  PAPERS  AND
 DOCUMENTS,  SHALL  BE  CONFIDENTIAL AND MAY NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY
 PERSON OR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AGENCY EXCEPT WHERE SPECIFICALLY  AUTHORIZED
 BY THE COURT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
