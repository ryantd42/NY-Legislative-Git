  (II)  A  RESIDENT  WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED INFORMED CONSENT WITHIN
 THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS;
  (III) A RESIDENT RECEIVING HOSPICE CARE;
  (IV) A RESIDENT OF A NURSING HOME'S CERTIFIED BEHAVIORAL UNIT;
  (V) A RESIDENT WITH A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE; OR
  (VI) AN EMERGENCY AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION.
  (B)  WHERE  A  RESIDENT  LACKS  CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO HEALTH CARE AND
 LACKS A LAWFUL REPRESENTATIVE, A PRESCRIPTION UNDER THIS  SECTION  SHALL
 BE  SUBJECT  TO  SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION TWENTY-NINE HUNDRED NINETY-

 HOSPITAL. TO CONSTITUTE INFORMED CONSENT, THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE SHALL
 BE GIVEN TO THE RESIDENT  OR,  WHERE  THE  RESIDENT  LACKS  CAPACITY  TO
 CONSENT TO HEALTH CARE, THE RESIDENT'S LAWFUL REPRESENTATIVE, IN A CLEAR
 AND EXPLICIT MANNER:

 NESS OF THE RESIDENT'S ILLNESS, DISORDER OR CONDITION THAT  THE  MEDICA-
 TION IS INTENDED TO TREAT;
  (II)  THE  ANTICIPATED  BENEFIT  FROM  THE MEDICATION, AND THE DOSAGE,
 FREQUENCY, AND DURATION OF THE ORDER;
  (III) THE PROBABILITY OF SIDE EFFECTS AND  SIGNIFICANT  RISKS  OF  THE
 MEDICATION,  INCLUDING  THE NATURE, DEGREE, AND DURATION OF SUCH EFFECTS
 AND REASONABLY KNOWN RISKS;

 AND THE REASON THAT THE PRESCRIBING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL PREFERS THE
 PROPOSED MEDICATION IN THIS INSTANCE; AND
  (V)  THAT  THE  RESIDENT  OR  LAWFUL  REPRESENTATIVE  HAS THE RIGHT TO

  3. A NURSING HOME AND A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED
 TO  OBTAIN  CONSENT  UNDER  THIS SECTION TO ISSUE AN ORDER FOR USE OF AN
 ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION FOR A RESIDENT IN A NURSING HOME  WHERE  IT  IS
 NECESSARY  IN AN EMERGENCY TO PROTECT AGAINST AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE
 LIFE, HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THE RESIDENT OR ANOTHER PERSON.  THE  MEDICA-
 TION  MUST  BE  THE  MOST  APPROPRIATE  AVAILABLE MEANS OF REDUCING THAT
 THREAT, WITH THE LEAST RISK OF HARM CONSIDERING THE RESIDENT'S CONDITION
 OR DISORDER. THE ORDER SHALL ONLY APPLY,  IN  THE  ABSENCE  OF  CONSENT,
 DURING THE EMERGENCY. WHERE AN ORDER IS MADE UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION, THE
 HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONAL SHALL IMMEDIATELY RECORD THE USE OF THE ANTI-
 PSYCHOTIC MEDICATION, THE REASON FOR THE USE, AND  THE  DOSAGE,  IN  THE
 RESIDENT'S MEDICAL RECORD; AND SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY THE RESIDENT OR THE
 RESIDENT'S  LAWFUL  REPRESENTATIVE  WHO  WOULD HAVE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO
 CONSENT, AND ANY FAMILY  MEMBER  REQUIRED  TO  BE  NOTIFIED  UNDER  THIS
 SECTION AND RECORD SUCH NOTIFICATIONS IN THE RESIDENT'S MEDICAL RECORD.

 FOR OR REGULATION OF CONSENT TO HEALTH CARE TREATMENT.
