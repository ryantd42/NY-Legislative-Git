  §  2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 13-192 of the adminis-
 trative code of the city of New York, as amended by chapter 720  of  the

 the provisions of this section.
  § 3. This act shall take effect December 1, 2023.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Sections 13-191
 and  13-192  of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (ACCNY),
 both enacted by Chapter 844 of the Laws of 1987, to extend the eligibil-
 ity provisions providing for the payment of Transit Police Officers' and
 Transit Police Superior Officers' Variable Supplements Funds (VSF) bene-
 fits to certain retirees.
  Specifically, this proposed legislation would provide for payments  to
 former  New  York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) members who
 are retired for service from the  New  York  City  Transit  Police  (TP)
 between  October  1,  1968 and June 30, 1987 (Prior Retirees) with 20 or
 more years of service. These benefits would be paid from  the  following
 VSFs (referred to hereafter as the Impacted VSFs):
  * Transit Police Officers' Variable Supplements Fund (TPOVSF), and
  *  Transit  Police  Superior  Officers'  Variable  Supplements  Fund
 (TPSOVSF).
  Effective Date: December 1, 2023.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS - VSF PAYMENTS: Each of the Impacted VSFs currently
 provides supplemental non-pension benefits to former NYCERS members  who
 retired  for  service  on  or after July 1, 1987 from TP with 20 or more
 years of service.
  The amount of VSF benefits paid  is  currently  $12,000  per  Calendar
 Year.  These VSF benefits are payable on an annual basis around December
 15th to eligible former NYCERS members for their lifetimes. There are no
 optional  forms  of  payment.  Upon the death of the NYCERS retiree, VSF
 payments cease.
  If the proposed legislation were to be  enacted,  all  Prior  Retirees
 would  become immediately eligible for VSF benefits on the December 15th
 subsequent to the Effective Date and for each year thereafter.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it has been assumed  that  bene-
 fits payable under this proposed legislation are prospective only (i.e.,
 there  would  be no retroactive payments for VSF benefits due before the
 Effective Date for such Prior Retirees).
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census  data  and  the
 actuarial  assumptions  and  methods  described herein, the enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an  increase  in  the  Present
 S. 6587  3
 
 Value  of  Future  Benefits (PVFB) of the Impacted VSFs of approximately
 $21.6 million.
  There  are  no  active  TP members of NYCERS and therefore there is no
 mechanism in place for funding the TP VSFs since the VSFs' funding allo-
 cation method normally would be based on the ratio of active  TP  member
 salaries  to  salaries  of  all  active  members in NYCERS. Therefore, a
 transfer from NYCERS to the Impacted VSFs would be necessary to fund the
 additional VSF benefit obligations.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT -  EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of  this
 proposed  legislation  would  result  in an increase in Fiscal Year 2024
 contributions of approximately $23.9 million.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, since those that  would  benefit
 are  retired,  and  therefore  have  no  remaining working lifetime, the
 entire increase in PVFB with interest  to  Fiscal  Year  2024  would  be
 recognized immediately.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  334  Prior  Retirees  as  of  June 30, 2022 had an average age of
 approximately 81.2 years.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
