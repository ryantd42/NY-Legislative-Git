  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 20, 2023, as Love Your Pet Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
appreciate  the service, companionship, loyalty and happiness pets bring
to the lives of their owners; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions, this Legislative Body is proud to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Wednesday, February 20, 2023, as  Love
Your  Pet  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observation of National Love Your Pet Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of the households in New York State have at least  one
pet, whether it be dogs, cats, birds, fish, reptiles or rats; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pets  provide  their  owners  with  benefits,  such  as
companionship, decrease depression,  stress  and  anxiety,  lower  blood
pressure,  improve  immunity  and  decrease the risk of heart attack and
stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS, While every day is a day to be enjoyed with your pet,  Love
Your  Pet Day is a day set aside to give your animal extra attention, to
pamper your pet and focus on the  special  relationship  you  have  with
them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 20, 2023, as Love
Your Pet Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
