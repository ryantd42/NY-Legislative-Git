 Introduced by M. of A. PAULIN -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Cities
 
 AN  ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to establishing
  a parking placard review board
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  Metropolitan  Transportation
 Sustainability Advisory Workgroup issued a report in 2018, which  recom-
 mended  ending placard abuse as a way to reduce congestion. The legisla-
 ture hereby finds and declares that the  issuance  of  vehicle  placards
 encourages  commuting  by  private vehicles and has led to congestion in
 the New York metropolitan area, consisting of the counties of New  York,
 Bronx,  Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rock-
 land. The New York metropolitan area is designated a nonattainment  area
 for failure to meet environmental protection agency (EPA) national ambi-
 ent air quality standards.
  Further,  the  EPA has indicated that the transportation sector of the
 New York metropolitan area is the largest contributor to greenhouse  gas
 emissions  in  the  United States, accounting for 28% of emissions, with
 light duty vehicles, such as personal cars and trucks, making up 59%  of
 those transportation sector emissions.
  A  reduction  in  motor  vehicle  traffic and congestion, particularly
 commuter traffic into and out of Manhattan, is necessary to reduce these
 emissions and improve air quality for the entire New  York  metropolitan
 area.
  §  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new article
 10-E to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 10-E
  PARKING PLACARD REVIEW BOARD
 SECTION 3985. PARKING PLACARD REVIEW BOARD.

 PARKING  PLACARD REVIEW "BOARD", HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE "BOARD",
