 DISTRICT SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM TAXATION BY ANY MUNICIPAL CORPORATION  FOR
 SCHOOL  PURPOSES,  IN WHICH LOCATED, TO THE TOTAL EXTENT OF THE ASSESSED
 VALUATION THEREOF PROVIDED THE GOVERNING  BOARD  OF  SUCH  MUNICIPALITY,
 AFTER  PUBLIC  HEARING,  ADOPTS  A  LOCAL  LAW,  ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION
 PROVIDING THEREFOR.
  2. ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN  OF  THIS
 TITLE  APPLICABLE  TO  THE  GRANTING  OF EXEMPTIONS FOR GENERAL, COUNTY,
 CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE, OR SCHOOL PURPOSES INSOFAR AS SUCH  PROVISIONS  ARE
 NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE APPLICABLE

  3. (A) TO QUALIFY FOR EXEMPTION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, THE PROPERTY
 MUST  BE  A ONE, TWO OR THREE FAMILY RESIDENCE, A FARM DWELLING OR RESI-
 DENTIAL PROPERTY HELD IN CONDOMINIUM OR COOPERATIVE FORM  OF  OWNERSHIP.

 A. 3733  2
 
 THE PROPERTY IS PARTIALLY USED BY THE OWNER AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE, THAT
 PORTION WHICH IS SO USED SHALL BE ENTITLED TO THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED  BY
 THIS  SECTION;  PROVIDED THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE EXEMPTION EXCEED THE
 ASSESSED VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT PORTION.
  (B)  PRIMARY  RESIDENCE.  THE PROPERTY MUST SERVE AS THE PRIMARY RESI-
 DENCE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE OWNERS THEREOF.
  (C) TRUSTS. IF LEGAL TITLE TO THE PROPERTY IS  HELD  BY  ONE  OR  MORE
 TRUSTEES,  THE  BENEFICIAL  OWNER  OR  OWNERS SHALL BE DEEMED TO OWN THE
 PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (D) FARM DWELLINGS NOT OWNED BY THE RESIDENT. (I) IF  LEGAL  TITLE  TO
 THE FARM DWELLING IS HELD BY AN S-CORPORATION OR BY A C-CORPORATION, THE
 EXEMPTION  SHALL  BE GRANTED IF THE PROPERTY SERVES AS THE PRIMARY RESI-
 DENCE OF A SHAREHOLDER OF SUCH CORPORATION.
  (II) IF THE LEGAL TITLE TO THE FARM DWELLING IS HELD BY A PARTNERSHIP,
 THE EXEMPTION SHALL BE GRANTED IF THE PROPERTY  SERVES  AS  THE  PRIMARY
 RESIDENCE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE PARTNERS.
  (III)  ANY  INFORMATION  DEEMED  NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH SHAREHOLDER OR
 PARTNER STATUS FOR ELIGIBILITY PURPOSES SHALL BE CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL
 AND EXEMPT FROM THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW.
  4. (A) THE COMBINED INCOME OF ALL OF THE OWNERS, AND  OF  ANY  OWNERS'
 SPOUSES  RESIDING  ON THE PREMISES, MAY NOT EXCEED THE APPLICABLE INCOME
 STANDARD SPECIFIED HEREIN.
  (I) FOR FINAL ASSESSMENT ROLLS TO BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO  TWO  THOUSAND
 TWENTY-THREE,  ELIGIBILITY  FOR THE EXEMPTION SHALL BE BASED UPON INCOME
 FOR THE INCOME TAX YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF MAKING  APPLI-
 CATION  FOR  THE EXEMPTION, AND THE INCOME STANDARD SHALL BE SIXTY THOU-
 SAND DOLLARS.
  (II) FOR FINAL ASSESSMENT ROLLS TO BE COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND  TWEN-
 TY-THREE,  ELIGIBILITY  FOR THE EXEMPTION SHALL BE BASED UPON INCOME FOR
 THE INCOME TAX YEAR ENDING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE,  AND  THE  INCOME
 STANDARD  SHALL  BE  THE  PREVIOUSLY-APPLICABLE INCOME STANDARD OF SIXTY
 THOUSAND DOLLARS INCREASED BY THE  COST-OF-LIVING-ADJUSTMENT  PERCENTAGE
 FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS COMPUTATION, THE COST-
 OF-LIVING-ADJUSTMENT  PERCENTAGE  FOR  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE SHALL BE
 EQUAL TO THE "APPLICABLE INCREASE PERCENTAGE" USED BY THE UNITED  STATES
 COMMISSIONER  OF  SOCIAL  SECURITY  TO DETERMINE MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY
 BENEFITS PAYABLE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE TO INDIVIDUALS, AS  PROVIDED
 BY  SUBSECTION (I) OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF TITLE FORTY-TWO OF
 THE UNITED STATES CODE.

 THE APPLICABLE INCOME TAX YEAR, COST-OF-LIVING-ADJUSTMENT PERCENTAGE AND
 APPLICABLE INCREASE PERCENTAGE SHALL ALL BE ADVANCED BY  ONE  YEAR,  AND
 THE  INCOME  STANDARD SHALL BE THE PREVIOUSLY-APPLICABLE INCOME STANDARD
 INCREASED BY THE  NEW  COST-OF-LIVING-ADJUSTMENT  PERCENTAGE.  IF  THERE
 SHOULD  BE  A  YEAR FOR WHICH THERE IS NO APPLICABLE INCREASE PERCENTAGE
 DUE TO A GENERAL BENEFIT INCREASE AS DEFINED  BY  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF
 SUBSECTION (I) OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF TITLE FORTY-TWO OF THE
 UNITED  STATES  CODE, THE APPLICABLE INCREASE PERCENTAGE FOR PURPOSES OF
 THIS COMPUTATION SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE THE PERCENTAGE WHICH  WOULD  HAVE
 YIELDED THAT GENERAL BENEFIT INCREASE.
  (IV) IN NO CASE SHALL AN INCOME STANDARD BE DECREASED FROM ONE ASSESS-
 MENT ROLL TO THE NEXT.
  (V)  IF  THE INCOME STANDARD INITIALLY COMPUTED FOR AN ASSESSMENT ROLL
 IS NOT EXACTLY EQUAL TO A MULTIPLE OF FIFTY DOLLARS, IT SHALL BE ROUNDED
 UP TO THE NEXT HIGHER MULTIPLE OF FIFTY DOLLARS.
