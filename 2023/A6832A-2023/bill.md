**Session:** 2023
**Sponsor:** Jen Lunsford
**Status:** Assembly Floor Calendar

## Summary

Allows for treatment costing less than $1,500 to be done without prior approval, and more clearly defines the list of "pre-authorized procedures" as a floor on treatment as opposed to its current status as a ceiling; allows non-network providers of testing to be compensated at the provider network rate negotiated by the carrier.
