 public  comment on its contents. The supervisor shall ensure that notice

 upon request, to residents within the town.
  4. Following the hearing or hearings held pursuant to paragraph one of
 this subdivision, but prior to certification of the improvement plan  by
 the  state monitor, the state monitor shall publicly report to the board
 an assessment of all public comments concerning the proposed plan and  a
 description  of  any  changes  made  to  such plan as a result of public
 comments received. The certified plan must be submitted  to  the  board,
 comptroller,  governor,  the  temporary president of the senate, and the
 speaker of the assembly.
  (b) Attend all meetings of the  board  including  executive  sessions.
 The  state  monitor, or designee of the monitor, shall be deemed to be a

 members  at all meetings of the board and participate in all board hear-
 ings and meetings, and the  supervisor  shall  be  required  to  provide
 adequate  notice to the state monitor of all such meetings and hearings.
 The state monitor shall ensure to the extent practicable that the  board
 conducts  all meetings, including executive sessions, in compliance with
 article 7 of the public officers law, and shall be  authorized  to  seek
 written advisory opinions from the committee on open government.
  (c)  Supervise  the  fiscal  and  operational  management of the town,

 temporary president of the senate, and the speaker of  the  assembly  on
 the progress of the strategic fiscal improvement plan, actions undertak-
 en by the monitor, any financial information the monitor deems appropri-
 ate,  and  other  town matters of importance.  At the conclusion of the
 monitor's appointment as determined by section seven of  this  act,  the
 state  monitor shall issue a final report that includes long term recom-
 mendations that address the unique needs of the town.
  § 5. Appeal process for monitor decisions. Notwithstanding  any  other
 law, rule or regulation to the contrary, all decisions made by the state
 monitor,  including  decisions to overturn board and supervisor actions,
 shall be final and conclusive unless and until modified or  reversed  in
 an  appeal  to  the comptroller pursuant to this section. When the board
 alleges that a reversal of a board or supervisor decision by  the  state
 monitor  violates  the regulations of the comptroller, or the terms of a
 certified five-year strategic fiscal improvement  plan,  the  board  may
 appeal by petition to the comptroller.
