  COMMENDING The Center upon the occasion of hosting
  its Annual World Refugee Day Celebration on June 20,
  2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
commend The Center upon the occasion of hosting its Annual World Refugee
Day Celebration on Tuesday, June 20, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Refugee Day is a time to recognize the  contributions
of  refugees in Utica, and observe the plight of 60 million individuals,
1  in  22  persons,  globally  that  are  refugees  or  in  refugee-like
situations; to date, close to 16,000 refugees have resettled and come to
call the Mohawk Valley their home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership  of Executive Director Shelly
Callahan, The Center strives to assist refugees, immigrants and  Limited
English Proficient (LEP) individuals throughout the integration process,
and  helps  them achieve independence and self-sufficiency by developing
products and services; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees  (UNHCR)
is  mandated  by  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  to  lead  and
coordinate international action to protect refugees and  find  solutions
to refugee problems worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is important to recognize that the United States has a
long history of helping and protecting refugees, and is signatory to the
1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status  of  Refugees  and
its 1967 Protocol; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a
resolution on December 4, 2000, naming June 20th of every year as  World
Refugee  Day,  bringing  attention to the plight of the world's refugees
and to extend to them encouragement, support and respect; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Refugee Day 2023 is dedicated to protecting  refugees
and  providing them with opportunities to rebuild their lives safely and
with dignity; this year, World Refugee Day also marks a key  moment  for
the  public to show support for families and individuals forced to flee;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The communities of the Mohawk Valley, Oneida County and the
City of Utica continue to  both  welcome  refugees  and  make  resources
available  to  them  and  their  families  to  lead dignified lives, and
achieve security in personhood and  to  follow  life,  liberty  and  the
pursuit of happiness; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend The Center upon the occasion of hosting its Annual World Refugee
Day Celebration on Tuesday, June 20, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
