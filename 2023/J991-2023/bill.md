  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Lyme Disease  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  health and well-being of the citizens of the State of
New York are of paramount importance to this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lyme disease  is  a  common  but  frequently  misunderstood
illness  that,  if  not  caught  early  and  treated properly, can cause
serious health problems; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the federal Centers for  Disease  Control  and
Prevention  (CDC)  and  the  New  York  State Department of Health, Lyme
disease was identified in 1977, when arthritis was observed in a cluster
of children in and around Lyme, Connecticut; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)
designated Lyme disease as a nationally notifiable disease in January of
1991; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lyme  disease,  found  in  approximately  80  countries
worldwide,  is  caused  by  the  bacterium  Borrelia  burgdorferi and is
transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected  black
legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, commonly called the deer tick; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  more  than a dozen tick-borne illnesses in the
United States, in addition to Lyme disease; one tick may carry more than
one disease resulting in people receiving more than  one  "co-infection"
from a single tick bite; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is difficult to diagnose co-infections because symptoms
are very common, but co-infections generally result  in  a  more  severe
illness, with more symptoms and a longer recovery period; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Those  with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases can present
symptoms that mimic and can sometimes be misdiagnosed as mental illness,
depression, nutritional deficiencies or Alzheimer's disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Infected ticks normally live  on  deer  and  mice  and  the
majority  of  tick  bites occur in the summer months when ticks are most
active, and when more people are enjoying the outdoors; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the CDC, Lyme disease is found most frequently
in the upper Midwest and Northeast United States; in 2019, 91%  of  Lyme
disease  cases  were  reported  from  14  states: Connecticut, Delaware,
Maine,  Maryland,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  New  York,
Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  Vermont,  Virginia,  West  Virginia,  and
Wisconsin; and
 
  WHEREAS, The federal CDC estimated that 476,000 people are diagnosed
and treated for Lyme disease each year while only 35,000  cases  of  the
disease are actually reported; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lyme  disease  became reportable in New York State in 1986
and there have been approximately 26,000 diagnosed cases of Lyme disease
in the state between 2017 and 2019; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over a 13-year period, Lyme disease was the listed cause of
death  of  nine  New  York residents outside of New York City, with five
victims from the mid-Hudson Valley region; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lyme disease is hard to diagnose because  the  most  common
sign individuals and doctors look for when determining if one contracted
Lyme  disease  is  a  red  bull's  eye  rash  surrounding  the tick bite
("erythema migrans"); however, this rash does not appear 20-30% of  Lyme
disease cases; the other indications of this disease are common flu-like
symptoms and joint pain, which often lead to misdiagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  arrival  of  Spring, more people will enjoy the
outdoors and come into  contact  with  ticks;  the  observance  of  Lyme
Disease  Awareness  Month  provides  an opportunity for the State of New
York to  focus  on  and  bring  awareness  of  Lyme  disease  and  other
tick-borne diseases to its citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lyme  Disease  Awareness  Month provides an opportunity to
focus on this significant and complex disease, to provide information on
and raise public awareness of its causes, effects and treatments, and to
underscore important education and research efforts surrounding Lyme and
tick-borne diseases; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Lyme Disease
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
