 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  disability retirement of certain New York city correction members
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of  subdivision  b  of  section  507-a  of  the
 retirement  and social security law, as added by chapter 452 of the laws
 of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  1. Have at least ten years of total  service  credit,  EXCEPT  THAT  A
 MEMBER  IN  THE  UNIFORMED  PERSONNEL OF THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF
 CORRECTION MAY FILE AN APPLICATION WITHOUT REGARD TO LENGTH OF  SERVICE,
 and
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would modify the eligibil-
 ity requirements of Retirement and Social Security  Law  (RSSL)  Section
 507-a  for  certain  New York City Department of Correction (Correction)
 members of the New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS).
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, Covered Participants  refers  to
 NYCERS  Correction  members  who  are  subject  to  RSSL Article 14, but
 excludes non-Enhanced Revised Plan Correction Members.
  Under the proposed legislation, Covered Participants with less than 10
 years of credited service would be entitled to 507-a disability benefits
 without having to show the disability resulted from a work-related acci-
 dent.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, Covered Participants who are determined
 to be disabled by the NYCERS' Medical Board,  and  have  accumulated  at
 least 10 years of service credit, are eligible for an immediate ordinary

 disability  retirement  (ODR)  allowance  pursuant to RSSL Section 507-a
 equal to the greater of:
  1) 1/3 of Final Average Salary (FAS), or
  2) 1/60 of FAS multiplied by credited service.
  If  such member is also eligible for Service Retirement, the ODR bene-
 fit cannot be less than the retirement allowance for Service Retirement.
  Under the proposed legislation, if enacted, the ODR benefit under RSSL
 Section 507-a would become available to disabled  Covered  Participants,
 subject  to approval under the applicable statutes and procedures estab-
 lished by NYCERS, irrespective of service credit accumulation.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, the Actuary has assumed that the
 proposed Section 507-a benefit  would  only  be  available  to  eligible
 Covered Participants prospectively on and after the Effective Date.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: The ultimate cost of this proposed
 legislation would be any additional benefits paid to NYCERS participants
 compared with current law. The timing of the  financial  impact  of  the
 proposed  legislation  would  depend  on  the number, salaries, age, and
 lengths of service of Covered Participants who become eligible for 507-a
 benefits and the actuarial assumptions and methods employed by the Actu-
 ary for such purposes.
  Based on  the  anticipated  Covered  Participants  and  the  actuarial
 assumptions and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed
 legislation would increase the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions by approximately $0.9 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to NYCERS, there would  be  a  decrease  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued  Liability  (UAL)  of  approximately $13.7 million, offset by an
 increase in the Present Value of future employer Normal  Cost  of  $14.6
 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer contributions for New York City of approximately $303,000 which
 is  the  result  of  an  increase  in  the Normal Cost offset by the UAL
 payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 15 years
 and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over  a  15-year  period
 (14  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag Methodology) using level dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data used in the Preliminary June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS
 to determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There were 3,102 Covered Participants with less than 10 years of cred-
 ited service as of June 30, 2022 and they had an average age of approxi-
 mately  37.7  years,  average service of approximately 6.2 years, and an
 average salary of approximately $108,400.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods in effect
 for the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 A. 6864  3
 
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The initial additional administrative costs of NYCERS and other  New
 York City agencies to implement the proposed legislation.
  *  The  impact  of  this  proposed legislation on Other Postemployment
 Benefit (OPEB) costs.
