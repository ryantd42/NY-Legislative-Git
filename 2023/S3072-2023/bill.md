 S. 3072  2
 
  §  2.  Subdivisions  1,  3  and 4 of section 1225-d of the vehicle and
 traffic law, subdivision 1 as amended by section 6 and subdivision 4  as
 amended  by  section 10 of part C of chapter 58 of the laws of 2013, and
 subdivision 3 as added by chapter 403 of the laws of 2009,  are  amended
 to read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall oper-
 ate  a  motor  vehicle  while using any portable electronic device while
 such vehicle is in motion; provided, however, that no person shall oper-
 ate a commercial motor  vehicle  while  using  any  portable  electronic
 device  on  a  public  highway  including  while  temporarily stationary
 because of traffic, a traffic control device, or other momentary delays.
 [Provided further, however, that a person shall  not  be  deemed  to  be
 operating  a  commercial motor vehicle while using a portable electronic
 device on a public highway when such vehicle is stopped at the side  of,
 or  off, a public highway in a location where such vehicle is not other-
 wise prohibited from stopping by law, rule,  regulation  or  any  lawful
 order or direction of a police officer.]
  3. Subdivision one of this section shall not apply to [(a)] the use of
 a  portable electronic device for the sole purpose of communicating with
 any of the following regarding  an  emergency  situation:  an  emergency
 response operator; a hospital; a physician's office or health clinic; an
 ambulance company or corps; a fire department, district or company; or a
 police  department[,  (b)  any  of  the  following  persons while in the
 performance of their official duties: a police officer or peace officer;
 a member of a fire department, district or company; or the  operator  of
 an authorized emergency vehicle as defined in section one hundred one of
 this chapter].
  4.  A  person  who holds a portable electronic device in a conspicuous
 manner while operating a motor vehicle or while operating  a  commercial
 motor vehicle on a public highway including while temporarily stationary
 because  of traffic, a traffic control device, or other momentary delays
 [but not including when such commercial motor vehicle is stopped at  the
 side  of,  or  off, a public highway in a location where such vehicle is
 not otherwise prohibited from stopping by law, rule, regulation  or  any
 lawful  order  or direction of a police officer] is presumed to be using
 such device[, except that a person operating a commercial motor  vehicle
 while using a portable electronic device when such vehicle is stopped at
 the  side  of, or off, a public highway in a location where such vehicle
 is not otherwise prohibited from stopping by law,  rule,  regulation  or
 any  lawful order or direction of a police officer shall not be presumed
 to be using such device]. The presumption established by  this  subdivi-
 sion is rebuttable by evidence tending to show that the operator was not
 using the device within the meaning of this section.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
