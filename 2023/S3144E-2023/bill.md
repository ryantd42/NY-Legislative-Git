 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  increasing the earning limitations for retired persons in positions of
  public service
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS
 SECTION, THE EARNINGS LIMITATION FOR FOR RETIRED PERSONS IN  A  POSITION
 OF  PUBLIC SERVICE SHALL BE INCREASED TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE
 YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE AND THEREAFTER.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend Section 212 of the Retirement and Social Securi-
 ty Law (RSSL) to set the salary a retired  person  may  earn  in  public
 employment  without  reduction in retirement allowance to $50,000 during
 the calendar year 2023 and thereafter. Currently, the  salary  limit  is
 $35,000.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), if enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  the
 direct  cost  incurred  would  be the retiree's post-retirement earnings
 more than $35,000 each calendar year, not to  exceed  the  full  pension
 benefit  paid  by  the NYSLRS during the calendar year. Annually, NYSLRS

 will determine which  retirees  earned  post-retirement  income  with  a
 public employer.
  In  the  New  York  State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement  System
 (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25 of the RSSL, these direct costs  would
 be borne entirely by the State of New York and would require an itemized
 appropriation  sufficient  to pay the cost of the provision. The benefit
 improvement will be funded by including a separate  itemized  charge  on
 the  annual  invoice  of the State of New York, beginning March 1, 2025,
 equal to the cost quoted above, plus interest.
  In the New York State and Local  Police  and  Fire  Retirement  System
 (NYSLPFRS),  those  participating employers that elect to hire a retired
 person pursuant to this legislation will incur annual costs equal to the
 additional pension payments quoted above, plus interest.
  In addition to the direct costs quoted above, insofar as this proposal
 disrupts the usual pattern and timing of employee turnover (that is,  if
 members  retire  earlier than assumed and participating employers hire a
 retiree instead of a new billable member),  shifts  in  member  behavior
 could generate losses that increase the average billing rates.
  *  In  the  20-year  and  25-year service-based plans, average billing
 rates could increase from 27.8% to 37.7%.
  * In the age-based plans, average billing rates  could  increase  from
 13.7% to 17.2%.
  The  actual  increase  in  billing  rates  will depend upon member and
 employer utilization, with the rates above representing an upper limit.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2022 Report of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.
  The  actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in the 2020,
 2021, and 2022 Annual Report to the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial  Assump-
 tions,  and  the  Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York:

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate, dated March 13, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-121,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  add  a  new  subdivision  2-a to Section 212 of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law to increase the  earnings  limitation
 for  retired  members  in  positions of public employment to $50,000 for
 calendar year 2023 and thereafter. Currently,  the  earnings  limitation
 for each calendar year is $35,000.

  This significant increase in the earnings-after-retirement limit could
 have  an  impact  on  the  Retirement System's patterns of retirement by
 inducing some members to retire earlier than they otherwise would  have.
 As a general rule of thumb, earlier retirement represents an increase in
 plan  costs  since members will be receiving their benefits for a longer
 period of time.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $81.9
 million or 0.44% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System. Data distributions and statistics can be found in  the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.
  The  source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-36 dated June 2, 2023
 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New  York  State  Teachers'
 Retirement  System and is intended for use only during the 2023 Legisla-
 tive Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the New York
 State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the American Academy
 of Actuaries and I meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
