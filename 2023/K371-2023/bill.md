  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 1-5, 2023, as Maternal Health Awareness Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1-5, 2023, as Maternal
Health Awareness Week in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with
World Maternal Mental Health Day, May 3, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Organizations  from around the world, including the United
States, Canada, United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Argentina, Malta, New
Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Germany, and Nigeria, are leading  efforts
to  raise  awareness  about  maternal mental health through a collective
social  media  push  and  in-country  events;  Postpartum  Support
International is proud to be a member of this worldwide task force; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the New York State Department of Health and
Office of Mental Health, there are four  recognized  types  of  maternal
depression: prenatal depression, "baby blues," postpartum depression and
postpartum psychosis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  BlueDot  Project was created by Peggy O'Neil Nosti, a
mother who suffered from postpartum anxiety with  her  third  child  who
wanted  to find a way to let other mothers know they were not alone; she
created a subtle image of a blue dot and a silver lining  to  illustrate
hope; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  all  types have similar symptoms, the prevalence
rates, some symptoms and time frame  of  the  depressions  differ;  some
studies  also  explore  postpartum major depression, which is similar to
major depression except after pregnancy; and
 
  WHEREAS, For example, "baby blues" is the least severe, and  usually
lasts about two weeks maximum after delivery; it is the most common, and
as many as 80 percent of new mothers suffer from "baby blues"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  symptoms include exhaustion, crying, sleep problems,
anxiety and mood fluctuations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Postpartum depression (PPD) is  becoming  more  well-known,
and it affects 10 to 20 percent of new mothers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Symptoms must last more than two weeks to be considered PPD
and not just "baby blues"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are also more symptoms associated with PPD, such as
feeling inadequate or guilty, feeling sad constantly, feeling  suicidal,
 
not  attaching or bonding to the baby, overly worrying about the baby or
not being interested at all in the baby; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Information obtained from the New York State Department of
Health indicates  that  10-20%  of  new  mothers  suffer  from  maternal
depression,  including periods of sadness, anxiety, fatigue and thoughts
of death or suicide; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than  1  out  of  every  1,000  new  mothers,  the
maternal depression they experience, also known as postpartum psychosis,
can lead to hallucinations and mania; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1-5, 2023, as Maternal
Health Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
