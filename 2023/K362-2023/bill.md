  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 25, 2023, as  Teacher  Diversity  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  custom  of this Legislative Body, in regard to the
prosperity of education, to encapsulate the importance of educating  our
future leaders to become productive members of society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2023, as  Teacher  Diversity
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Teacher Diversity Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The desire to have a diverse coalition of  teachers  across
all  racial  and  ethnic  backgrounds  that  support  positive  and
extraordinary educational outcomes for students, and in which  there  is
variety  in  voices  that  seek  to provide resources and curriculum for
students of color; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Board of Regents helped kickstart  an  initiative  that
would  promote  diversity,  equity,  and inclusion in schools across New
York State, with policies stating  the  principle  that  schools  should
foster  environments  in  which educational engagement and learning is a
must; and
 
  WHEREAS, The purpose of such a framework was instituted due  to  the
racial  injustices  and  violence inflicted upon minority communities in
recent  years,  with  Black  and  Asian  Americans  subjected  to  harsh
discrimination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  ultimate  goal  results  in  the  support  of  school
districts  prioritizing  equitable  approaches  to  teaching,  community
engagement,  and  learning so that students can enjoy the good fruits of
education; and
 
  WHEREAS, Academic  excellence  and  outcomes,  higher  average  test
scores,  decrease  in  drop-out  rates,  as  well  as  the likelihood of
students attending college, are just a few of the positives that  result
when there is equity and inclusion in schools; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  understands  that  there  is  an
obligation to create an environment in  which  students,  teachers,  and
faculty feel inclusive within their school communities, and more must be
done  on  the  local, State and National levels to increase awareness of
this important issue; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2023, as Teacher
Diversity Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
