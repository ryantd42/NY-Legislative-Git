 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law,  in  relation  to  exempting
  ambulances  and  emergency medical services vehicles from paying tolls
  on the New York state thruway when engaged in an emergency operation

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  378-a of the public authorities law, as added by
 chapter 23 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  § 378-a. Emergency service permits. 1. The authority is hereby author-
 ized and directed to [issue refunds for tolls incurred by ambulances  or
 fire  vehicles  engaged  in an emergency operation, or, at the option of
 the authority, to] issue emergency services permits  for  use  by  ambu-
 lances,  EMERGENCY  MEDICAL  SERVICES  VEHICLES, and fire vehicles which
 shall provide for travel at no charge between interchanges and  barriers
 while  such vehicles are engaged in an emergency operation. For purposes
 of this section, the term "ambulance" shall have  the  same  meaning  as
 such term is defined by section one hundred-b of the vehicle and traffic
 law, the term "fire vehicle" shall have the same meaning as such term is
 defined by section one hundred fifteen-a of the vehicle and traffic law,
 and  the  term "emergency operation" shall have the same meaning as such
 term is defined by section one hundred fourteen-b  of  the  vehicle  and
 traffic  law.  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS SECTION, THE TERM "EMERGENCY
 MEDICAL SERVICES VEHICLE" SHALL MEAN  AN  APPROPRIATELY  EQUIPPED  MOTOR
 VEHICLE  OWNED  OR  OPERATED  BY AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY AS
 DEFINED IN SECTION THREE THOUSAND ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW AND  USED
 FOR  THE  PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTING EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND EQUIP-
 MENT TO SICK OR INJURED PERSONS. In any rules and regulations promulgat-
 ed for the implementation of this section, the authority  may  establish
 the  type  of documentation or other proof satisfactory to the authority

 that an ambulance or fire vehicle was engaged in an emergency  operation
 at the time a toll was incurred.
  2. If, upon the completion of an audit conducted by a certified public
 accountant selected by the authority, the authority can demonstrate that
 the issuance of [refunds or] permits as authorized in subdivision one of
 this  section causes a significant loss of revenue to the authority, the
 authority is authorized, pursuant to a resolution of the board, to offer
 such [refunds or] permits at a discount  of  the  cash  cost  per  mile;
 provided,  however,  that, prior to such board resolution, the authority
 shall hold at least two public hearings, at a time  and  location  which
 will,  to  the  extent  practicable,  maximize  the participation of the
 general public.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
