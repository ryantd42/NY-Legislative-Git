  COMMENDING  the Dolgeville Community Band upon the
  occasion of hosting its 2023 Summer Concert Series
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those musical organizations that have brought entertainment and
cultural enrichment to the citizens of the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Dolgeville Community Band upon the occasion of  hosting  its
2023  Summer  Concert  Series  to  be held on Thursdays in Plowe Park in
Dolgeville, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Dolgeville Community Band has a  long  history  in  the
community  of  Dolgeville,  first performing as the Citizens Cornet Band
around 1886; the band performed in the band stand that was on the corner
of Van Buren and South Main Street and was later  moved  to  Plowe  Park
where the current band stand is today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the park where the Dolgeville Community Band plays
is named after Harold Plowe, long time band director who died  in  1982;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Dolgeville Community Band has persisted through time as
a  strong  musical entity with many great directors, past band directors
included Ralph Faville, Max Cramer, William Hayward, Arthur  Elwood  and
Sam  Camardello; the current band director is Katlin Wolford, who is the
Dolgeville Central School Band Director; and
 
  WHEREAS, Promoting the joys of music, the Dolgeville Community  Band
is an important part of the community and introduces people to different
genres of music; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bringing  the  community  together  once a week during the
summer, the Dolgeville Community Band members consist  of  students  and
adults from around the Mohawk Valley who share a love of music; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is most fitting that we take time to celebrate the music
of  our  Nation,  to honor our artists and musicians, and to express our
appreciation to everyone who patronizes the arts; and  as  we  celebrate
the  music,  we  celebrate  and give thanks to our American freedom, the
only atmosphere in which artists can truly create and in which music  is
truly the expression of the soul; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The arts, in whatever form presented, are central to human
expression; they are truly a universal language and  their  contribution
to  the  development  of  friendship and understanding among all peoples
cannot be underestimated; individuals who provide a means of  preserving
a  part  of our rich American past and which contribute to the community
in such noble endeavors as  aforementioned,  are  held  in  the  highest
regard by this Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Dolgeville Community Band upon the occasion of  hosting  its
2023 Summer Concert Series; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Dolgeville Community Band.
