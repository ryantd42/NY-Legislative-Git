  (a)  A  claimant's  weekly benefit amount shall be one twenty-sixth of
 the remuneration paid during the highest calendar quarter  of  the  base
 period  by  employers,  liable  for contributions or payments in lieu of
 contributions under this article, provided the claimant has remuneration
 paid in all four calendar quarters during his  or  her  base  period  or
 alternate  base  period,  BUT  SHALL  NOT BE LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

 calendar quarters during his or her base period or alternate base period

 highest  calendar  quarter  of  the  base period by employers liable for
 contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under  this  article,
 BUT SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. A claimant's week-
 ly benefit shall be one twenty-sixth of the average remuneration paid in
 the  two  highest quarters paid during the base period or alternate base

 contributions under this article when the claimant has remuneration paid
 in  two  or  three  calendar  quarters provided however, that a claimant
 whose high calendar quarter is four thousand dollars or less but greater
 than three thousand five hundred seventy-five dollars shall have a week-
 ly benefit amount of one twenty-sixth of such high calendar quarter, BUT
