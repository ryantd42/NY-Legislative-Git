 other surcharges imposed upon the residents of the assisted living resi-
 dence, their residents' representatives, and/or  any  applicable  health
 insurance  plan,  long  term care plan or other insurance plan providing
 payment to the residence on behalf of the resident prior to the approval
 of the plan for closure and/or  decertification  by  the  commissioner[,
 provided however, that the operator may increase the amount of any rent,
 fees or other surcharges imposed upon an individual resident correspond-
 ing with an increase in the individual's supplemental security income;];

 operator  shall also notify residents and the residents' representatives
 that additional time will be provided to residents who make  good  faith
 efforts,  as  determined  by  the commissioner, to secure an alternative
 setting and have demonstrated a reasonable basis for needing  more  than

 setting, so long as it remains safe and appropriate  to  reside  in  the
 assisted living residence at [such] THE time.

 relating to specifying procedures for the closure and/or decertification
 of  assisted living residences, as proposed in legislative bills numbers
