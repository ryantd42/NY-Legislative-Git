 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. J. M. GIGLIO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to  authorizing
  the issuance of distinctive plates for members of the Seneca Nation of
  Indians
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares
 that  the  sovereign  territory  of  the  Seneca  Nation of Indians (the
 Nation) lies completely within the state of New York  and  as  such  the
 relationship  between  the state and the Nation is governed by a complex
 set of rules based upon various  state  statutes,  signed  treaties  and
 agreements  that  have  resulted  over time from the 1794 signing of the
 Treaty of Canandaigua. It is this treaty that the United States acknowl-
 edged the Nation's independence and sovereignty.
  A most recent agreement, known as the 1976  Southern  Tier  Expressway
 Agreement,  was  entered  into between the Nation and the New York state
 Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The 1976 Agreement was predicated
 on chapter 962 of the laws of 1973 in which lands of the Allegany  state
 park  were transferred from the office of parks, recreation and historic
 preservation to the Seneca Nation of Indians in lieu of  lands  acquired
 by the state as rights of way for the Southern Tier Expressway.
  One of the terms agreed to by the Nation included New York state issu-
 ing members of the Nation distinctive motor vehicle license plates. This
 legislation  acknowledges  the unique, historical and vital relationship
 that the Seneca Nation of Indians has  held  with  New  York  state  and
 specifically  authorizes the department of motor vehicles to develop and
 implement a series of specially numbered license plates  to  members  of
 the Seneca Nation.
  § 2. Section 404 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 1-b to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
