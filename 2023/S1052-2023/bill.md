 AN ACT in relation to requiring a review and  report  on  the  adequacy,
  reasonableness and affordability of insurance products designed to pay
  for  the  future  medical expenses of injured plaintiffs who receive a
  judgment  or  settlement  for  damages  that  include  future  medical
  expenses; and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expira-
  tion thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The legislature hereby finds  that  the  costs  of  medical
 malpractice  payouts  are  significant for the defendant medical profes-
 sionals, medical groups and hospitals responsible for these  payouts  to
 successful  plaintiffs.  The COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the essential
 role these health care providers play in New York state's protection  of
 the  health  and  welfare of its residents. One component of the medical
 malpractice lawsuit payouts that are extremely costly are future medical
 expenses for the injured plaintiff. The tremendous financial impact upon
 the health care community due  to  the  ongoing  and  growing  costs  of
 medical malpractice payouts highlights the need to examine the possibil-
 ity  of  the  current market for insurance products such as annuities to
 lessen the tremendous financial burden of these  payouts  on  the  vital
 health  care services the New York health care community provides to all
 New Yorkers.
  § 2. The superintendent of financial services shall,  in  consultation
 with  the  office  of  court  administration,  review  and report on the
 adequacy,  reasonableness  and  affordability  of  insurance  products
 designed  to  pay  for the future medical expenses of injured plaintiffs
 who receive a judgment or settlement for  damages  that  include  future
 medical expenses.  Such report shall include but not be limited to:

  (a) the present state of the marketplace regarding insurance products,
 including  but  not  limited  to  annuities,  that could be purchased by
 defendants to satisfy the future medical expenses incurred by plaintiffs
 who receive either a judgment or settlement for future medical  expenses
 damages;
  (b)  the  experience of states and jurisdictions as far as such insur-
 ance products and any laws either allowing or  requiring  defendants  to
 purchase  such insurance products to satisfy the future medical expenses
 portion of a judgment or settlement; and
  (c) recommendations to promote reasonable, adequate and cost-effective
 insurance products available for defendants to purchase such products.
  § 3. Within two hundred seventy days of the  effective  date  of  this
 act,  the  superintendent of financial services shall submit such report
 to the governor, the temporary president of the senate, and the  speaker
 of the assembly.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed on the sixtieth day after the submission of  the  report
 required  by section three of this act; provided that the superintendent
 of financial services shall notify the legislative bill drafting commis-
 sion upon the submission of the report required by section three of this
 act in order that the commission may maintain  an  accurate  and  timely
 effective data base of the official text of the laws of the state of New
 York  in furtherance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of the
 legislative law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
