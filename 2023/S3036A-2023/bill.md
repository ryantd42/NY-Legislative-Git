 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education  law  and the social services law, in
  relation to the practice of a licensed school psychology practitioner
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent and findings.  The legislature finds
 that the ever-growing social and emotional needs of children  and  youth
 have  only  been  intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The legislature
 acknowledges that the U.S. Surgeon General has declared a national emer-
 gency in relation to children's mental  health,  and  that  parents  and
 professionals  are  calling for greater access to mental health services
 for children. The legislature therefore intends to ensure  services  are
 available  for  children, youth, and their parents to seek the help they
 need by allowing school psychology professionals to assist  these  indi-
 viduals  outside  of  a  traditional setting. The legislature finds that
 increasing the number of trained professionals who are able  to  provide
 mental  health  services outside of an educational setting will be posi-
 tive for the children, parents, school, and society.  School  psychology
 professionals  are trained and educated in psychopathology, the psychol-
 ogy of learning, motivation and human development in  order  to  address
 the  many  factors  influencing  their  adjustment  in  school and life.
 Accordingly, these factors may  include  trauma,  social  and  emotional
 adjustment,  inequitable  and historically marginalized community condi-
 tions, school  climate,  and  home/school/community  collaboration.  The
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 3036--A  2
 
 legislature  therefore declares that by addressing the needs of children
 through  prevention  services,  assessments  and/or  counseling,  school
 psychology  professionals  can contribute to their future success. It is
 important  that  school  psychology  professionals  are held to specific
 standards and requirements that will ensure competent services.
