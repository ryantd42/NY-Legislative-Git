 AN ACT to amend the civil rights law, in relation to  privacy  of  elec-
  tronic fare and toll records
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Statement of legislative intent. The legislature finds and
 declares that public entities increasingly are  establishing  electronic
 toll  and  electronic fare payment systems, which have the potential for
 great convenience to the general public. E-Z Pass, for  example,  allows
 motorists  to  have toll charges automatically deducted from pre-establ-
 ished accounts.  Programs such as these have proven popular with consum-
 ers. But some consumers,  public  officials  and  public  entities  have
 raised  legitimate  questions about the extent to which records of indi-
 vidual travel created by such electronic toll and fare  programs  should
 be  disclosed,  and  under  what  circumstances.  This bill establishes
 reasonable, uniform provisions for maintaining  the  confidentiality  of
 such  records, while at the same time authorizing disclosure in cases of
 legitimate law enforcement need.
  § 2.  The civil rights law is amended by adding a new section 50-h  to
 read as follows:
  §  50-H. PRIVACY OF ELECTRONIC TOLL AND FARE RECORDS. 1.  DEFINITIONS.

 E-Z PASS RECORDS, WHICH CONTAIN INFORMATION SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
