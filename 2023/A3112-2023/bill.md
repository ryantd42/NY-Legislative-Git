 AN  ACT to amend the education law, in relation to prohibiting cyberbul-
  lying
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent.  The legislature finds that:
  a.  Bullying  is a long-standing problem among school-aged children in
 New York state and throughout the nation. With increasing  accessibility
 to  electronic  means  of communication, bullying has transformed from a
 predominantly school-based issue to a broader societal problem.
  b. Researchers have demonstrated that bullying  has  long-term  conse-
 quences.  Further, bullying goes beyond the classroom to bullying on the
 job, on athletic teams, on college campuses and the internet.
  c. Experts researching bullying  have  suggested  that  one  tool  for
 schools  to  use  in  combatting  bullying  is  to  maintain and enforce
 consistent policies against bullying and  harassment,  including  cyber-
 bullying.  Such  enforcement  is  not always possible if bullying occurs
 away from school or by a non-student.
  d. Perpetrators of cyberbullying are often more extreme in the threats
 and taunts they inflict on their victims, as they do  not  actually  see
 their victim's emotional reaction to the abuse and believe that they are
 anonymous. Victims of cyberbullying suffer very real and serious harm as
 a result of these incidents, often showing signs of depression, anxiety,
 social  isolation,  nervousness  when  interacting  with technology, low
 self-esteem and declining school performance.  In  some  cases,  victims
 attempt  or  commit suicide in part because of the cyberbullying they've
 endured.
  e. Enactment of this act  is  necessary  and  appropriate  to  further
 ensure  that  New  York  state's  public  schools are safe and free from
 cyberbullying.
