 to read as follows:
  (a) A charter school may be located in  part  of  an  existing  public
 school  building,  in space provided on a private work site, in a public
 building or in any other suitable location. Provided, however, before  a
 charter  school  may  be  located  in  part of an existing public school
 building, the charter entity shall provide  notice  to  the  parents  or
 guardians  of the students then enrolled in the existing school building

 space. FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  AN  EXISTING  PUBLIC  SCHOOL
 BUILDING  MEANS  A  BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED OR IS UNOCCUPIED
 BUT DESIGNATED FOR POTENTIAL PUBLIC SCHOOL USE.
  §2. This act shall take effect immediately.
