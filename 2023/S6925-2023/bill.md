 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The railroad law is amended by adding a new section 52-f to
 read as follows:
  § 52-F. FREIGHT TRAIN LENGTH. NO FREIGHT TRAIN TRAVELING  ON  A  TRACK
 WITHIN  THE  STATE  SHALL  EXCEED  EIGHT  THOUSAND  FIVE HUNDRED FEET IN
 LENGTH. THE COMMISSIONER IS HEREBY EMPOWERED  TO  PROMULGATE  RULES  AND
 REGULATIONS  TO  ESTABLISH  A  WAIVER PROCESS TO PERMIT THE OPERATION OF
 FREIGHT TRAINS IN EXCESS OF EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET  FOR  SITU-
 ATIONS  WHERE  THE  COMMISSIONER DETERMINES SUCH WAIVER IS IN THE PUBLIC
 INTEREST AND UPON AN ENGINEER'S DETERMINATION  THAT  A  TRAIN  EXCEEDING

 PLANNED ROUTE.
  § 2.  This act shall take effect ninety  days  after  it  shall  have
 become  a law; provided, however, that this act shall be deemed repealed
 if any federal agency determines in writing that this act  would  render
 New  York state ineligible for the receipt of federal funds or any court
 of competent jurisdiction finally determines that this act would  render
 New  York  state  out  of compliance with federal law or regulation; and
 provided that the commissioner of transportation shall notify the legis-
 lative bill drafting commission upon any  such  determination  in  order
 that  the  commission may maintain an accurate and timely effective data
 base of the official text of the laws of the state of New York in furth-
 erance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of  the  legislative
 law  and section 70-b of the public officers law. Effective immediately,

 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
