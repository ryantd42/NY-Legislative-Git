  CONGRATULATING  the  State  of  Israel  upon  the
  occasion of the 75th Anniversary of its independence
  and  reaffirming  the  bonds  of  friendship  and
  cooperation between the State of New York and Israel
 
  WHEREAS,  April 26, 2023, marks the 75th Anniversary of the founding
of the modern State of Israel  in  the  ancestral  home  of  the  Jewish
people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly
voted to partition the British Mandate of Palestine,  and  through  that
vote, to create the State of Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS, Israel was officially declared an independent nation on May
14,  1948,  and  the modern State of Israel was born out of the ashes of
the Holocaust and World War II where the death of six million  Jews  did
not  eliminate  the will of a people to seek dignity in life and a place
of respect and recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, In its 75 years of  statehood,  Israel  has  established  a
modern  parliamentary  democracy,  which  has been preserved through the
vigilance  of  its  people  and  their  strong  cultural  commitment  to
democratic norms; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate  the  State  of  Israel  upon  the  occasion  of  the  75th
Anniversary  of its independence and reaffirming the bonds of friendship
and cooperation between the State of New York and  Israel,  as  well  as
commitment to peace in the region, dignity for Israel, its neighbors and
throughout the world.
