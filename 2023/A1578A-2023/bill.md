 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The banking law is amended by adding a new section 675-a to

 REMAIN IN THE DEPOSITOR, AND THE DEPOSITOR SHALL NOT  BE  CONSIDERED  TO
 HAVE  MADE A GIFT OF ANY PART OF THE DEPOSIT OR OF ANY ADDITIONS THERETO
 OR ACCRUALS THEREON TO THE OTHER PERSON.
  (C) IF AN ADDITION IS MADE TO SUCH AN ACCOUNT BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE
 DEPOSITOR,  SUCH AN ADDITION AND ACCRUALS THEREON SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO

 DECEASED  DEPOSITOR'S  ESTATE,  SHALL, TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH PAYMENT, BE
 RELEASED FROM LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING A RIGHT TO THE FUNDS  AND
 THE  RECEIPT  OR ACQUITTANCE OF THE EXECUTOR, ADMINISTRATOR OR QUALIFIED
 REPRESENTATIVE TO WHOM PAYMENT IS MADE SHALL BE A VALID  AND  SUFFICIENT
 RELEASE  AND DISCHARGE OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION. IF THE DEPOSITOR HAS
 INDICATED THE INTENTION THAT THE  REMAINING  FUNDS  PASS  TO  THE  OTHER
 PERSON BY RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP, PAYMENT OR DELIVERY TO THE OTHER PERSON
 OF ANY OR ALL OF THE FUNDS REMAINING IN THE ACCOUNT SHALL BE A VALID AND
 SUFFICIENT  RELEASE TO THE BANKING ORGANIZATION IF MADE PRIOR TO SERVICE
 UPON IT OF A RESTRAINING ORDER, INJUNCTION OR OTHER APPROPRIATE  PROCESS
 FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION PROHIBITING SUCH PAYMENT.
  3.  REGULATIONS  OF  THE  SUPERINTENDENT. (A) THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL
