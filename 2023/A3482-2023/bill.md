  tee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT establishing  the  New  York  state  public  defense  commission,
  providing  for  the  members, powers and duties thereof, and providing
  fiscal relief to localities; and to amend the county law, in  relation
  to public defense services

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature finds
 and declares that in  certain  proceedings  the  state  is  required  to
 provide  high  quality legal assistance to persons otherwise financially
 unable to obtain counsel and/or afford the necessary expenses of  repre-
 sentation.  Providing  public  defense  services  to  those  who face an
 economic barrier to obtaining legal counsel serves the ends  of  justice
 in  accordance with rights and privileges guaranteed by the constitution
 of the state of New York and the constitution of the  United  States  of
 America.  The  availability  of  high  quality  public  defense services
 affirms the faith of our citizens in our government of laws.
  The legislature further finds that the  present  system  of  requiring
 localities  to  provide public defense services with little state finan-
 cial assistance and no state oversight does  not  and  cannot  meet  the
 foregoing  objectives.  The existing statutory limit on fees for counsel
 assigned to provide public defense services has resulted in  a  shortage
 of  qualified  lawyers  to  provide defense services, thereby denying or
 delaying the representation to which public defense  clients  are  enti-
 tled.  The  present  system  has  caused court congestion and delay, and
 eroded public trust and confidence in the legal system.
  The legislature further finds that localities are struggling to  carry
 the increasing burden of fulfilling the state mandate to provide defense
 services,  and  cannot  bear  alone the cost of raising assigned counsel

 fees to reasonable levels. Local property owners should  be  given  some
 relief from the obligation of providing public defense services.
  The  legislature  further finds that no mechanism currently exists for
 state oversight of the provision of public defense services, despite its
 character as a state mandate and the appropriation of some  state  funds
 to support public defense services. Sound fiscal and governmental policy
 requires  oversight of defense services to ensure that the state mandate
 is being met, and to determine the most effective and  efficient  future
 allocation of state funds. Certain defense services can most efficiently
 and  effectively be provided by an independent commission.  Some locali-
 ties, especially those with smaller  populations,  could  benefit  by  a
 mechanism for delivering defense services directly by the state.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that public defense services must be
 provided in a manner that ensures the  independence  of  public  defense
 providers.
  Therefore, to address these needs, the legislature establishes in this
 act  the  New  York  state  public  defense commission to oversee public
 defense services in this state, reimburse localities for public  defense
 expenditures,  and  provide  defense  services  in extraordinary circum-
 stances.

 iture of funds.

 furnish information about how defense services are provided;
  b. publicizing the commission's oversight function  and  inviting  the

 information  and  express  concerns  about  the  provision  of  defense
 services;

 to meet the standards established by the commission pursuant to  section

 work with the locality or public defense provider to bring the  locality
 or public defense provider into compliance.

 provision of which would result in the disclosure  of  any  such  confi-
 dences  or  secrets,  or  would otherwise compromise the interest of any
 public defense client.

 commission  shall  be  exempt  from  the application of any provision of
 articles 6 and 7 of the public officers law.

 accordance with the provisions of the agreement establishing the office.
 Expenses  incidental to individual cases shall be paid by the county for

 [hereunder] PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION shall be a county charge to be paid
 upon  certification by the county treasurer out of an appropriation made
 for such purposes, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN EXPENSES MAY BE PAID WITH  FINAN-
 CIAL  ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE AS AUTHORIZED BY SECTION NINE OF THE NEW

 forty-nine  or  section  two  hundred sixty-two of the family court act,
 article six-C of the correction law or section four hundred seven of the
 surrogate's court procedure act, is financially unable to  obtain  them,
 A. 3482  10
 
 the court shall authorize counsel, whether or not assigned in accordance
 with  a  plan, to obtain the services on behalf of the defendant or such
 other person. The court upon a finding that timely procurement of neces-
 sary  services  could  not  await  prior authorization may authorize the
 services nunc pro tunc. The court  shall  determine  reasonable  compen-
 sation  for  the  services and direct payment to the person who rendered
 them or to the person entitled to reimbursement. [Only in  extraordinary
 circumstances  may  the  court provide for compensation in excess of one
 thousand dollars per investigative, expert or other service provider.]
  Each claim for compensation shall be supported by  a  sworn  statement
 specifying  the  time expended, services rendered, expenses incurred and
 reimbursement or compensation applied for or received in the  same  case
 from any other source.
