 include  the  words  "American",  "United States", "National", "New York
 State", "Independence" or  "Independent",  or  "Empire  State",  or  any
 abbreviation  or plural thereof, nor the name or part of the name, or an
 abbreviation  of  the name, of an existing party. [The emblem chosen may
 be a star, an animal, an anchor, or any other proper symbol, but may not
 be the same as or similar to any emblem, insignia, symbol or  flag  used
 by  any  political  or governmental body, agency or entity nor any reli-
 gious emblem, insignia, symbol or flag, nor the portrait of any  person,
 nor  the  representation  of  a  coin  or  of the currency of the United
 States.] The name [and emblem] chosen shall not be similar to or  likely
 to  create  confusion  with  the  name [or emblem] of any other existing
 party or independent body.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 6-128 of the election law, paragraph (a)
 as amended by chapter 619 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:

 shall contain:
  (a)  The  name  of the party filing the nominations which shall not be
 altered or modified once submitted.

 name and residence address of the person so nominated.

  § 4. Subdivision 3 of section 6-138 of the election law, as amended by
 chapter  305  of the laws of 1992, paragraph a as amended by chapter 619
 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  3. a. The name selected for the independent body making the nomination
 shall be in English characters and shall not include the name or part of
 the name or an abbreviation of the name or part of the name,  nor  shall
 the  [emblem or] name be of such a configuration as to create the possi-
 bility of confusion with the [emblem or] name of a then existing  party,
 or  the [emblem or] name of an independent body selected by a previously
 filed independent nominating petition for the same office.  Such  name
 selected for such independent body shall continuously remain the name of
 such  party  as  defined  in  subdivision three of section 1-104 of this
 chapter.
  b. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph a  of  this  subdivi-
 sion,  if  the  [emblem or] name selected for an independent body on any
 independent nominating petition is the same  as  that  selected  by  any
 previously  filed  independent  nominating petition for the same office,
 the board of elections with which such later petition was  filed  shall,
 not  later  than two days after the filing of such later filed petition,
 send notice of such duplicate selection of [emblem or]  name  by  first-
 class  mail,  to the candidate for such office who was nominated by such
 later filed petition, and that the candidate  to  whom  such  notice  is
 S. 2302  3

 required  to  be  sent  may file with such board of elections, not later
 than seven days after such notice was mailed, a certificate selecting  a
 different [emblem or] name.
  c.  A  person who has been nominated or who expects to be nominated as
 the candidate of an independent body for the office of President of  the
 United  States at any election for such office may, not later than three
 days after the last day to file  nominating  petitions,  file  with  the
 state  board  of  elections, a special certificate which shall be irrev-
 ocable, stating that such person does not wish to permit candidates  for
 any  other  office,  except  the  office of Vice-President of the United
 States, to appear on the ballot with the same name [and emblem]  as  the
 independent body which has nominated or will nominate such candidate for
 the office of President.
  d.  Not  later  than  seven days after the last day to file nominating
 petitions, the state board of elections shall notify each local board of
 elections of the name of each candidate  for  President  of  the  United
 States  who has filed such a special certificate, together with the name
 [and emblem] of the independent body  selected  on  the  petition  which
 nominated such candidate.
  e. If any candidate has been nominated for any other office by a peti-
 tion which selected the same name [or emblem] for an independent body as
 the  name  [or emblem] selected on the petition which nominated a candi-
 date for President of the United States who has filed a special  certif-
 icate  pursuant  to  paragraph  c  of  this  subdivision,  the  board of
 elections with which the petition nominating  such  candidate  for  such
 other office was filed shall, not later than ten days after the last day
 to  file  nominating  petitions,  send  to each such candidate, by first
 class mail, notice that a special certificate pursuant to paragraph c of
 this subdivision has been filed and that  the  candidate  to  whom  such
 notice  is  sent  may  file with such board of elections, not later than
 seven days after such notice  was  mailed,  a  certificate  selecting  a
 different name [and emblem].
  f.  If  [such a petition shall not show an emblem, or if] the petition
 shall fail to select a name for such independent body, or if pursuant to
 the provisions of paragraph b or paragraph  e  of  this  subdivision,  a
 candidate  shall  fail to select another [emblem or] name for such inde-
 pendent body, the officer or board in whose office the petition is filed
 shall select [an emblem or] A name [or both] to distinguish  the  candi-
 dates  nominated thereby. The name [and emblem] shown upon such petition
 or selected by a candidate authorized to make such  selection  by  para-
 graph b or paragraph e of this subdivision, or selected by an officer or
 board  shall  also  conform  to  the  requirements  of this chapter with
 respect to names [or emblems] permitted to be selected by a party.
  g. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall  preclude  a  court  of
 competent jurisdiction from rejecting an independent nominating petition
 if  the  court  determines that fraud was involved in the selection of a
 name [or emblem].
  § 5. Paragraph a of subdivision 1 of section  6-140  of  the  election
 law,  as  amended by chapter 176 of the laws of 2017, is amended to read
