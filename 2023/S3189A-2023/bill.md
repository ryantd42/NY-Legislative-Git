 section 3614-f of the public health  law  to  ensure  that  rates  being
 offered are adequate and meet the department of health's actuarial stan-
 dards.  The comptroller, in consultation with the medicaid fraud control
 unit, may develop and promulgate a process to ensure such audits  comply
 with  state  and  federal  law  to  protect  proprietary information and
 contracts. In the event that the comptroller finds evidence that managed
 care organizations are not paying sufficient adequate rates,  they  will
 refer  such instances to the department of health and the medicaid fraud
 control unit for enforcement. If the department of health or  the  medi-
 caid  fraud  control  unit  chooses not to pursue action related to this
 referral, it shall inform, in writing, the comptroller's  office  as  to
 the  reasoning.  Such reports, and the department of health's responses,
 shall be public information and  made  available  on  the  comptroller's
 website. For the purposes of this section, the term "managed care organ-
 ization" shall mean an entity operating pursuant to section 364-j of the
 social services law or article 44 of the public health law.
  §  7. Severability.  If any provision of this act, or any application
 of any provision of this act, is held to be invalid, or to violate or be
 inconsistent with any federal law or regulation, that shall  not  affect
 the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of this act, or any
 other application of any provision of this act which can be given effect
 without  that  provision or application; and to that end, the provisions
 and applications of this act are severable.
  § 8. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 section two of this act shall take effect January 1, 2024.
