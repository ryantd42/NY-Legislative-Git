 INFORMATION FOR THE PHYSICIANS AND  NURSE  PRACTITIONERS  AUTHORIZED  TO
 EVALUATE  WHETHER A STUDENT MAY RESUME ATHLETIC ACTIVITY.  Such informa-
 tion shall be posted on the department's website.
  §  2.  Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph a of subdivision 42 of section
 305 of the education law, as added by chapter 496 of the laws  of  2011,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (iii)  requiring the immediate removal from athletic activities of any
 pupil believed to have sustained or who has sustained a  mild  traumatic
 brain injury. In the event that there is any doubt as to whether a pupil
 has  sustained  a concussion, it shall be presumed that [he or she] SUCH
 PUPIL has been so injured until proven otherwise. No  such  pupil  shall
 resume  athletic  activity  until [he or she] SUCH PUPIL shall have been
 symptom free for not less than twenty-four hours, and has been evaluated
 by and received written and signed authorization from a licensed  physi-
 cian  OR  A  CERTIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONER.  Such authorization shall be
 kept on file in the pupil's permanent health record.  Furthermore,  such
 rules  and  regulations  shall  provide  guidelines  for limitations and
 restrictions on school attendance and activities  for  pupils  who  have
 sustained  mild traumatic brain injuries, consistent with the directives
 of the pupil's treating physician OR A NURSE PRACTITIONER.
  § 3. Subdivision b of section 923 of the education law,  as  added  by
 chapter 500 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  b.  The  commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations requiring
 that any student displaying signs or symptoms of  pending  or  increased
 risk of sudden cardiac arrest shall be immediately removed from athletic
 activities and shall not resume athletic activity until [he or she] SUCH
 STUDENT  has  been evaluated by and received written and signed authori-
 zation from a licensed physician  OR  A  CERTIFIED  NURSE  PRACTITIONER.
 Such authorization shall be kept on file in the pupil's permanent health
 record.
  §  4.  Section 3624 of the education law, as amended by chapter 529 of
 the laws of 2002, is amended to read as follows:
  § 3624. Drivers,  monitors  and  attendants.  The  commissioner  shall
 determine and define the qualifications of drivers, monitors and attend-
 ants and shall make the rules and regulations governing the operation of
 all transportation facilities used by pupils which rules and regulations
 shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to, a maximum speed of fifty-five
 miles per hour for school vehicles engaged in pupil transportation  that
 are operated on roads, interstates or other highways, parkways or bridg-
 es  or  portions  thereof  that  have  posted  speed limits in excess of
 fifty-five miles per hour, prohibitions relating to smoking, eating  and
 drinking  and  any  and  all other acts or conduct which would otherwise
 impair the safe operation of such transportation facilities while  actu-
 ally  being  used  for  the  transport of pupils. The employment of each
 driver, monitor and attendant shall be  approved  by  the  chief  school
 administrator  of  a school district for each school bus operated within
 [his or her] SUCH CHIEF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR'S district. For the purpose
 of determining [his or her] SUCH DRIVER, MONITOR AND  ATTENDANT'S  phys-
 ical  fitness,  each  driver,  monitor  and attendant may be examined on
 order of the chief school administrator by a duly licensed physician  OR
 NURSE PRACTITIONER within two weeks prior to the beginning of service in
 each  school  year  as  a  school  bus driver, monitor or attendant. The
 report of the physician OR CERTIFIED  NURSE  PRACTITIONER,  in  writing,
 shall be considered by the chief school administrator in determining the
 fitness  of the driver to operate or continue to operate any transporta-
 tion facilities used by pupils and in determining  the  fitness  of  any
 A. 6446--B  3
 
 monitor  or  attendant to carry out [his or her] SUCH MONITOR OR ATTEND-
 ANT'S functions on  such  transportation  facilities.  Nothing  in  this
 section  shall  prohibit a school district from imposing a more restric-
 tive  speed limit policy for the operation of school vehicles engaged in
 pupil transportation than the speed  limit  policy  established  by  the
 commissioner.
  §  5.  Paragraph  (i)  of  subdivision  1 and subdivision 3 of section
 1203-a of the vehicle and traffic law, paragraph (i) of subdivision 1 as

 agent is located, except that, an issuing agent,  in  their  discretion,
 may  issue  a permit to a severely disabled person who is not a resident
 of the city, town, or village in which such  issuing  agent  is  located
 where  such  person  resides  in  a  city, town, or village in which the
 governing body has not appointed an issuing agent; and an issuing agent,
 in their discretion, may issue a temporary special  vehicle  identifica-
 tion parking permit, as authorized by subdivision three of this section,

 ily visiting the state; or

 municipality  may issue a temporary special vehicle identification park-
 ing permit to any person who is temporarily unable to  ambulate  without
 the  aid  of  an  assisting  device,  as  certified by [a physician] ANY
 HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER AUTHORIZED TO  CERTIFY  THAT  AN  INDIVIDUAL  IS
 SEVERELY  DISABLED  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED
 FOUR-A OF THIS CHAPTER.  Such temporary special  vehicle  identification
 parking  permit shall be valid for not more than six months and shall be
 recognized statewide.

 IZED TO CERTIFY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS SEVERELY DISABLED PURSUANT TO THAT
 SUBDIVISION, limits one or more of the following:

  (ii) ability to reach or access a parking meter due to use of a wheel-
 chair or other ambulatory device; or
  (iii)  ability  to  reach a height of forty-two inches from the ground

  (c) Any person required for medical reasons to be  shielded  from  the
 direct  rays  of  the  sun  and/or  any person operating a motor vehicle
 belonging to such person or in which such person is an habitual  passen-
 ger  shall be exempt from the provisions of subparagraphs one and two of
 paragraph  (b) of this subdivision provided the commissioner has granted
 an exemption and notice of such exemption is affixed to the  vehicle  as
 directed  by  the  commissioner.  The  applicant for such exemption must
 provide a physician's OR NURSE PRACTITIONER'S statement with the  reason
 for the exemption, the name of the individual with a medically necessary
 condition  operating  or transported in the vehicle, the specific condi-
 tion involved, and the minimum level of light transmission required. The
 commissioner shall only authorize exemptions where the medical condition
 certified by the physician OR NURSE PRACTITIONER is contained on a  list
 of medical conditions prepared by the commissioner of health pursuant to
 subdivision sixteen of section two hundred six of the public health law.
 If  such  [such]  exemption  is  granted,  the commissioner shall make a
 record thereof and shall distribute a sufficiently noticeable sticker to
 the applicant to be attached to any window so shielded or altered pursu-
 ant to such exemption.

 and traffic law, as added by chapter 675 of the laws of 1985, is amended

  (iii) the initial qualifying medical examination form and the biennial
 medical  examination  form completed by the carrier's physician OR NURSE

  § 9. Section 509-k of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by chapter
 1050 of the laws of 1974, is amended to read as follows:
  § 509-k. Ill or fatigued operator. No driver shall operate a bus and a
 motor carrier shall not permit a driver to operate a bus while the driv-
 er's ability or alertness  is  so  impaired,  or  so  likely  to  become
 impaired,  through  fatigue,  illness  or any other cause, as to make it
 unsafe for [him] SUCH DRIVER to begin or continue to operate the bus. At
 the request of the driver or the motor carrier such illness, fatigue, or
 other cause shall be certified by a qualified physician OR NURSE PRACTI-
 TIONER.  However, in a case of grave emergency where the hazard to occu-
 pants of the bus or other users of the highway  would  be  increased  by
 compliance with this section, the driver may continue to operate the bus
 to the nearest place at which that hazard is removed.

 follows:
  7.  The  provisions  of this section shall not apply to a passenger or
 operator with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability
 would prevent appropriate restraint in such safety seat or  safety  belt
 provided,  however,  such  condition is duly certified by a physician OR
 NURSE PRACTITIONER who shall state the nature of the handicap,  as  well
 as the reason such restraint is inappropriate.
  §  11.  Paragraph 1 of subdivision (a) of section 517 of the judiciary
 law, as amended by chapter 380 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to  read
 as follows:

 discretion, on the application of  a  prospective  juror  who  has  been
 summoned  to  attend,  excuse  such prospective juror from a part or the
 whole of the time of jury service or  may  postpone  the  time  of  jury
 service  to  a  later  day during the same or any subsequent term of the
 A. 6446--B  5
 
 court, provided that if the prospective juror is a breastfeeding  mother
 and  submits with her application a note from a physician OR NURSE PRAC-
 TITIONER indicating that the prospective  juror  is  breastfeeding,  the
 commissioner  shall excuse the prospective juror or postpone the time of
 jury service. The application shall be presented to the commissioner  at
 such  time  and  in  such  manner as [he or she] SUCH COMMISSIONER shall
 require, except that an application for postponement of the initial date
 for jury service may be made by telephone.
  § 12. The amendments to the public health law, education law,  vehicle
 and  traffic  law,  and judiciary law enacted by this act shall  not  be
 construed to expand or contract the scope of practice of any health care
 professional under title 8 of the education law.
  § 13. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
