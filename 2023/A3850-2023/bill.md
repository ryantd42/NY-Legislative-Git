 the laws of 2012, is amended to read as follows:
  §  190.  Establishment  or  extension of improvement districts. Upon a
 petition as hereinafter provided, the town board of any town may  estab-
 lish  or  extend  in  said  town a sewer, drainage, water, water quality

 to include lands situate within the boundaries of a water  district.  No
 such district shall be established or extended in a city or in an incor-
 porated  village  provided,  however, that such a district may be estab-
 lished or extended wholly or partly within an  incorporated  village  on
 consent  of  the  village  expressed in a local law, ordinance or resol-
 ution, subject to a referendum on petition under section twenty-four  of
 the  municipal  home  rule  law or a permissive referendum under article
 nine of the village law, as the case may be, and except, in the case  of
 a water quality treatment district, on consent of a village expressed in
 a local law or by resolution of the board of trustees and not subject to
 any referendum.
