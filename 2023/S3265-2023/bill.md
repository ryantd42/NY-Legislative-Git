  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 399-xx of the general business  law,  as
 added by chapter 690 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  2. Requirements. A commercial tower who responds to a call for assist-
 ance from an owner or operator of a vehicle that is inoperable or cannot
 be  safely operated or who offers to transport, repair, or render safely
 operable such a vehicle shall, in compliance with any reasonable request
 of an owner or operator of such vehicle, repair the vehicle or transport
 the vehicle and its  occupants  to  a  reasonably  safe  location  where
 repairs  can  be  made.  The  commercial  tower shall not be required to
 transport all vehicle occupants if the number of occupants  exceeds  the
 number of passengers that can be safely transported. The owner or opera-
 tor  of the vehicle shall be liable to the commercial tower for the cost
 of towing and repair services provided.  A WRITTEN INVOICE  STATING  THE
 S. 3265  5

 COST  OF THE TOWING AND/OR SERVICES, SIGNED BY BOTH THE COMMERCIAL TOWER
 AND THE OWNER OR AUTHORIZED USER OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE, SHALL BE PROVIDED
 PRIOR TO ANY TOWING OR SERVICES BEING PERFORMED.  The  commercial  tower
 shall  accept  cash  and all other forms of payment that such commercial
 tower accepts in the ordinary course of business, including  credit  and
 debit cards as those terms are defined in section five hundred eleven of
 this  chapter  as  payment for all or part of the charges for towing and
 repair services accepted and provided. The commercial tower may  require
 such proof of identification from persons making payments in forms other
 than  cash  as  the  commercial  tower requires for such payments in the
 ordinary course of business. If the  owner  or  operator  of  a  vehicle
 declines  services of the commercial tower or cannot or will not provide
 payment and identification for towing or repair services,  a  commercial
 tower shall notify law enforcement about the location and identification
 of  the vehicle and its occupants. The provisions of this section do not
 apply to a vehicle which is lawfully parked at the home of the vehicle's
 owner or operator.
  § 3. Section 20-509 of the administrative code of the city of New York
 is amended by adding a new subdivision e to read as follows:

 IZED USER OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE, SHALL BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO ANY TOWING OR
 REPAIR SERVICES BEING PERFORMED, EXCEPT WHERE THE TOWING WAS WITHOUT THE
 PRIOR CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION OF SUCH MOTOR VEHICLE OWNER.  UPON  THE
 RELEASE  OF  A  TOWED  MOTOR  VEHICLE THE OWNER SHALL RECEIVE AN INVOICE
 STATING THE AMOUNT CHARGED AND THE AMOUNT PAID.
  § 4. Subdivision 5 of section 6201  of  the  civil  practice  law  and
 rules,  as  amended by chapter 860 of the laws of 1977 and as renumbered
 by chapter 618 of the laws of 1992, is amended and a new  subdivision  6
 is added to read as follows:
  5.  the  cause  of action is based on a judgment, decree or order of a

 INTEREST. BEFORE A SHAREHOLDER MAY CLAIM CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER  SHARE-
 HOLDERS  UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH, HE OR SHE SHALL GIVE THEM NOTICE IN WRIT-
 ING THAT HE OR SHE INTENDS TO HOLD THEM SO LIABLE TO HIM  OR  HER.  SUCH
