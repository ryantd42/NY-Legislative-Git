 AN ACT to amend the state finance law and the judiciary law, in relation
  to establishing a fund to assist public service  attorneys  practicing
  public service law to repay their student loans
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be  cited  as  the  "public
 interest legal services loan assistance act".
  §  2.  Declaration  of  policy and legislative intent. The legislature
 reaffirms that the efficient and  effective  provision  of  high-quality
 legal  services  on  behalf of the state, its political subdivisions and
 the populations therein depends on competent, dedicated attorneys making
 a long-term commitment to public-service work, whether  as  prosecutors,
 public  defenders  or  other  indigent  defense  attorneys,  civil legal
 services attorneys, or the equivalent. The legislature  finds,  however,
 that  because  these  attorneys  often  carry significant and increasing
 student loan debt burdens and have grave  difficulty  in  repaying  such
 debts  on the relatively low salaries paid by most public interest posi-
 tions, many of these attorneys are being forced to leave public service.
 The loss of so many capable public interest attorneys, often at the very
 time they have achieved sufficient training and experience to handle the
 most complex matters of public concern, has had  an  adverse  impact  on
 government  generally and reduced the capacity of the criminal and civil
 justice systems to provide  the consistently high-quality legal services
 the people of New York state deserve. The  legislature  finds  that  the
 difficulty  of  attracting  and  retaining  well-trained public interest
 lawyers due to student loan debt frustrates the achievement of important
 constitutional and statutory policy objectives, increases  the  cost  of
 state  and  local  government,  and  diminishes public confidence in the

 criminal and civil justice systems. The legislature therefore recognizes
 the value of retaining these seasoned public servants in public interest
 positions and finds that it is in the public interest to provide  finan-
 cial  assistance  to  help  these  attorneys  repay their student loans.
 Accordingly, the legislature  hereby  establishes  the  public  interest
 legal services loan assistance fund.
  §  3. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 99-g to
 read as follows:
  § 99-G. PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL SERVICES LOAN ASSISTANCE FUND. 1.  THERE
 IS  HEREBY ESTABLISHED IN THE JOINT CUSTODY OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER AND
 THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR OF THE COURTS A SPECIAL FUND TO BE KNOWN AS  THE

 NEW YORK.
  2.  THE PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL SERVICES  LOAN  ASSISTANCE  FUND  SHALL
 CONSIST  OF  THE MONIES DEPOSITED THEREIN PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 SECTION FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE OF THE JUDICIARY  LAW,  AND  ALL  MONIES
 DEPOSITED  THEREIN  OR TRANSFERRED THERETO FROM ANY OTHER FUND OR SOURCE
 PURSUANT TO LAW, INCLUDING VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS,  TOGETHER  WITH  ANY
 INTEREST ACCRUED THEREON.
  3.  ALL  MONIES  IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL SERVICES LOAN ASSISTANCE
