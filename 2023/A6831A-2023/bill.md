 AN  ACT  to amend the public officers law, in relation to making certain
  public records available on the internet
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 84 of the public officers law, as added by chapter
 933 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 84. Legislative declaration. The legislature  hereby  finds  that  a
 free society is maintained when government is responsive and responsible
 to the public, and when the public is aware of governmental actions. The
 more  open  a  government  is with its citizenry, the greater the under-
 standing and participation of the public in government.  PEOPLE  HAVE  A
 RIGHT TO KNOW HOW GOVERNMENT OPERATES AND SPENDS MONEY.
  As  state  and  local government services increase and public problems
 become more sophisticated and complex and therefore harder to solve, and
 with the resultant increase in revenues and expenditures, it  is  incum-
 bent  upon  the state and its localities to extend public accountability
 wherever and whenever feasible.
  The people's right to know the process of governmental decision-making
 and to review the documents and statistics leading to determinations  is
 basic  to our society. Access to such information should not be thwarted
 by shrouding it with the cloak of secrecy or confidentiality.
  SINCE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW WAS FIRST  ADOPTED,  ADVANCES  IN
 TECHNOLOGY  HAVE  ENHANCED  THE  ABILITY  TO  GAIN  ACCESS TO AND WIDELY
 DISSEMINATE PUBLIC INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS  THAT
 GOVERNMENT  AGENCIES,  WHEN  AGENCIES  HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO, SHOULD
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6831--A  2
 
 PUBLISH PUBLIC RECORDS PROACTIVELY ON THE INTERNET THAT  ARE  OF  PUBLIC
 INTEREST AND AVAILABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  The  legislature  therefore  declares  that government is the public's
 business and that the public, individually and collectively and  repres-
 ented  by  a free press, should have access to the records of government
 in accordance with the provisions of this article.
  § 2. Subdivisions 3 and 4 of section 86 of the public officers law, as

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST, THE AGENCY  SHALL  STATE,

 IN  TWENTY  BUSINESS DAYS AND A DATE CERTAIN WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD,
 DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEN THE  REQUEST  WILL  BE  GRANTED  IN
 WHOLE OR IN PART, AND ADVISE IF EXCEPTIONS WILL APPLY.

 ANY OF THE REQUESTED RECORD OR RECORDS: (A) A STATEMENT OF DETERMINATION
 THAT ACCESS TO THE REQUESTED RECORD OR RECORDS CANNOT BE GRANTED BECAUSE
 THE  REQUEST  WAS  MADE TO THE WRONG AGENCY; (B) A STATEMENT OF DETERMI-

 SUBDIVISION FOR EACH CATEGORY OF RECORD IN A RECORDS REQUEST  CONTAINING
 MORE THAN ONE RECORDS REQUEST.
  (C)  An  agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request
 is voluminous or that locating, GENERATING, or reviewing  the  requested
 records  or  providing  the  requested  copies is burdensome because the
 agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may
 engage an outside professional service to provide  copying,  programming
 or  other  services required to provide the copy, the costs of which the
 agency may recover pursuant to  paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision  one  of
 section eighty-seven of this article.
  (D)  An  agency  may  require  a  person  requesting lists of names OF
 NATURAL PERSONS and RESIDENTIAL addresses to provide a  written  certif-
 ication  that such person will not use such lists of names and addresses
 for solicitation or fund-raising purposes and will  not  sell,  give  or
 otherwise  make available such lists of names and addresses to any other
 person for the purpose of allowing that person  to  use  such  lists  of
 names  and  addresses  for solicitation or fund-raising purposes. [If an
 agency determines to grant a request in whole or in part, and if circum-
 stances prevent disclosure  to  the  person  requesting  the  record  or
 records within twenty business days from the date of the acknowledgement
 of  the receipt of the request, the agency shall state, in writing, both
 the reason for the inability to grant the request within twenty business
 days and a date certain within a reasonable  period,  depending  on  the
 circumstances, when the request will be granted in whole or in part.]
  (E) Upon payment of, or offer to pay, the fee prescribed therefor, the
 entity  shall  provide a copy of such record and certify to the correct-
 ness of such copy if so requested, or as the case may be, shall  certify
 that  it  does  not  have  possession of such record or that such record
 cannot be found after diligent search. Nothing in this article shall  be
 construed  to  require any entity to prepare any record not possessed or
 maintained by such entity except the records  specified  in  subdivision
 three  of  section eighty-seven and subdivision three of section eighty-
 eight of this article. When an agency has the  ability  to  retrieve  or
 extract  a  record  or data maintained in a computer storage system with
 reasonable effort, it shall be required to do so. When doing so requires
 A. 6831--A  9
 
 less employee time than engaging in manual retrieval or redactions  from
 non-electronic  records,  the  agency  shall  be required to retrieve or
 extract such record or data electronically. Any programming necessary to
 retrieve  a record maintained in a computer storage system and to trans-
 fer that record to the medium requested by a  person  or  to  allow  the
 transferred  record  to be read or printed shall not be deemed to be the
 preparation or creation of a new record.
  [(b)] (F) All entities shall[, provided  such  entity  has  reasonable
 means  available,]  accept requests for records submitted in the form of
 electronic mail and shall respond to such requests by  electronic  mail,
 using  forms,  to  the  extent  practicable, consistent with the form or
 forms developed by the committee on open government pursuant to subdivi-
 sion one of this section and provided that the written requests  do  not
 seek a response in some other form.  AGENCIES SHALL NOT REQUIRE REQUESTS
 TO  BE  MADE  IN ANY SPECIFIC FORMAT AND MAY NOT IGNORE OR DENY REQUESTS
 NOT MADE IN THE AGENCY'S PREFERRED FORMAT.
  [(c)] (G) Each state agency, as defined in subdivision  five  of  this
 section,  that maintains a website shall ensure its website provides for
 the online submission of a request for records pursuant to this article.
  (H) ALL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS SHALL BE ATTRIBUTED TO A NATURAL  PERSON
 WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE RESPONDING ENTITY. RESPONSES CONTAINING DENIAL
