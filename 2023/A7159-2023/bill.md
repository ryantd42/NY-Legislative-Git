 CERTIFIED  MEDICAL USE OF MEDICAL MARIHUANA, AS DEFINED IN SECTION THIR-
 TY-THREE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW. IT SHALL BE  A  DEFENSE
 TO A PROCEEDING TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF A RESIDENTIAL UNIT THAT A LAND-

 SEEK TO RECOVER POSSESSION. A LANDLORD MAY REBUT SUCH DEFENSE BY SHOWING
 THAT HE OR SHE SEEKS TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF A RESIDENTIAL UNIT BECAUSE
 OF ANY OTHER LAWFUL GROUND.
  2. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL RESTRICT A LANDLORD'S LEGAL RIGHTS TO
 RECOVER  POSSESSION  OF  A  RESIDENTIAL  UNIT ON GROUNDS NOT BASED ON OR
 DERIVED FROM THE CERTIFIED MEDICAL USE OF MEDICAL MARIHUANA.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
