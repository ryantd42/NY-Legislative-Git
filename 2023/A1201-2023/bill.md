 AN ACT in relation to establishing the emergency preparedness month  act
  and  to  amend  the  tax  law,  in relation to exempting prefabricated
  go-bags and individual emergency preparedness items
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title.  This  act shall be known as the "emergency
 preparedness month act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares
 that  citizens  of  the state of New York are not properly equipped with
 the requisite supplies needed in the event of a disaster or other  emer-
 gency.  The legislature further declares that the impacts of disasters
 are mitigated when individuals have the  proper  emergency  preparedness
 supplies  they  need  to be self sufficient during a disaster, and those
 individuals are less likely to require state and local assistance during
 a disaster or other emergency.
  The legislature further declares that a tax free  period  for  certain
 emergency preparedness items and prefabricated go-bags shall provide the
 needed  incentive for individuals to purchase proper supplies and equip-
 ment to be used in the event of a disaster or other emergency.
  Therefore, the legislature declares the month of September to be emer-
 gency preparedness month in the state of New York.
  § 3. Section 1115 of the tax law is amended by adding two new subdivi-
 sions (ll) and (mm) to read as follows:
  (LL) (1) RECEIPTS FROM THE RETAIL SALE OF PREFABRICATED GO-BAGS  SHALL
 BE  EXEMPT  FROM  TAXES  IMPOSED BY THIS ARTICLE ANNUALLY FROM SEPTEMBER
 FIRST TO SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  NO  EXEMPTION  SHALL
 EXIST  UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH IF SUCH PREFABRICATED GO-BAGS WERE PURCHASED

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
