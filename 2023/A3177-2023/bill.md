 ly  understood.  Such  interpreter must, if he OR SHE has not previously

  (III)  THE  TESTIMONY OF ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO TESTIFIED IN AN OFFI-
 CIAL CAPACITY BEFORE THE GRAND JURY AND  OF  ALL  PERSONS  WHO  PROVIDED

 THEIR IDENTITIES.
  (D) THE APPLICATION SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION MAY
 BE MADE BY ANY PERSON, MUST BE IN WRITING AND, EXCEPT WHERE MADE BY  THE
 PEOPLE,  MUST  BE  UPON  NOTICE TO THE PEOPLE. THE COURT SHALL DIRECT OR
 PROVIDE NOTICE TO ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE PERSON  OR  AGENCY.  WHERE  MORE
 THAN  ONE  APPLICATION IS MADE HEREUNDER IN RELATION TO SUCH A DISMISSAL
 OR DIRECTION, THE COURT MAY CONSOLIDATE SUCH APPLICATIONS AND  DETERMINE
 THEM TOGETHER. WHEN NO APPLICATION HEREUNDER IS MADE, THE SUPERIOR COURT
 MAY  ORDER  DISCLOSURE ON ITS OWN MOTION AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (E) OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION AT ANY TIME FOLLOWING  NOTICE  TO  THE  PEOPLE  AND  AN
 OPPORTUNITY  TO BE HEARD AND REASONABLE EFFORTS TO NOTIFY AND PROVIDE AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TO ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE PERSON OR AGENCY.
  (E) UPON AN APPLICATION AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION  OR  ON  THE COURT'S OWN MOTION, THE COURT, AFTER PROVIDING PERSONS
 GIVEN NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER:
  (I) A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THE COUN-
 TY IN WHICH THE GRAND JURY WAS DRAWN AND IMPANELED ARE LIKELY AWARE THAT
 A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAD  BEEN  CONDUCTED  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THE
 SUBJECT MATTER OF THE GRAND JURY PROCEEDING; AND
  (II)  A  SIGNIFICANT  NUMBER  OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN SUCH
 COUNTY ARE LIKELY AWARE OF THE IDENTITY OF THE SUBJECT AGAINST WHOM  THE
 CRIMINAL  CHARGE  SPECIFIED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (C)  OF THIS SUBDIVISION WAS
 SUBMITTED TO A GRAND JURY, OR SUCH SUBJECT HAS CONSENTED TO SUCH DISCLO-
 SURE; AND
  (III) THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST IN DISCLOSURE.
  WHERE THE COURT IS SATISFIED THAT ALL THREE OF THESE FACTORS ARE PRES-
 ENT, AND EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (F) OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE
 COURT  SHALL DIRECT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO PROMPTLY DISCLOSE THE ITEMS
 SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.

 APPLICATION OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ANY INTERESTED PERSON, OR ON ITS
 OWN  MOTION,  THE COURT SHALL LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF THE ITEMS SPECIFIED IN

 DETERMINES  THERE  IS  A  REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE MAY
 LEAD TO DISCOVERY OF THE IDENTITY OF A WITNESS WHO IS NOT A PUBLIC SERV-
 ANT OR EXPERT WITNESS, IMPERIL THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF A GRAND JUROR WHO
 PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCEEDING OR A  WITNESS  WHO  APPEARED  BEFORE  THE
 GRAND JURY, JEOPARDIZE AN IDENTIFIED CURRENT OR FUTURE CRIMINAL INVESTI-
 GATION, CREATE A SPECIFIC THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY, OR DESPITE THE INTER-
 ESTS  REFLECTED  BY  THIS  SUBDIVISION  IS  CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF
 JUSTICE.
  (G) WHERE A COURT DETERMINES NOT TO DIRECT DISCLOSURE, IN WHOLE OR  IN
 PART, PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION, IT SHALL DO SO PROMPTLY IN A WRITTEN
 ORDER  THAT  SHALL  EXPLAIN WITH SPECIFICITY, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE,
 THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION.
  (H) WHERE AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION
 HAS BEEN DENIED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE APPLICANT  MAY  APPEAL  AS  OF
 RIGHT  FROM  SUCH  ORDER  TO THE APPELLATE DIVISION IN THE DEPARTMENT IN
 WHICH SUCH ORDER WAS ENTERED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ARTICLE  FOUR  HUNDRED
 SIXTY OF THIS CHAPTER.
