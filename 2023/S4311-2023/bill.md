 Introduced by Sens. SEPULVEDA, HARCKHAM, MAYER -- read twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Agricul-
  ture
 
 AN  ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to prohib-
  iting the operation of establishments where animals and/or  fowls  are
  slaughtered and butchered for food

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative intent. The  legislature  hereby  finds  that
 emergency measures must be enacted to help prevent the spread of zoonot-
 ic  and  other  infectious  diseases.  Experts throughout the world have
 concluded that the COVID-19 crisis is  likely  attributable  to  a  live
 animal  market.  Inspection reports from the department of agriculture
 and markets indicate ongoing health, safety and welfare problems at  New
 York's  markets.  Hundreds of thousands of human lives have already been
 lost and millions of people  have  been  sickened  during  the  COVID-19
 pandemic.  The  purpose of this law is to eliminate one potential vector
 for the transmission of zoonotic diseases, live animal markets, and  the
 suffering  it  causes therefrom at least until there is further examina-
 tion by  infectious  disease  experts  of  the  nexus  between  zoonotic
 diseases and live animal markets.
  §  2.  The  agriculture  and  markets  law  is amended by adding a new
 section 96-ee to read as follows:
  § 96-EE. PROHIBITION OF THE OPERATION OF ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE  ANIMALS
 AND/OR  FOWLS ARE SLAUGHTERED FOR FOOD. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION
 OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY:
  (A) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL NOT LICENSE ANY PERSON,  FIRM,  PARTNERSHIP
 OR  CORPORATION  TO  OPERATE  ANY  PLACE  OR ESTABLISHMENT WHERE ANIMALS
 AND/OR FOWLS ARE SLAUGHTERED OR BUTCHERED FOR FOOD;
  (B) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL IMMEDIATELY  SUSPEND  THE  LICENSE  OF  ANY
 PERSON,  FIRM, PARTNERSHIP OR CORPORATION THAT CURRENTLY HOLDS A LICENSE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
