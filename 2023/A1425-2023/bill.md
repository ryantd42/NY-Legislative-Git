  of the laws of 2020 amending the state finance law relating to  estab-
  lishing the New York state campaign finance fund, in relation thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivisions 1, 11, and  19  of  section  14-200-a  of  the
 election  law,  as  added  by section 4 of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2020, are amended to read as follows:
  1. "authorized committee" means the single political committee  desig-
 nated  by  a candidate pursuant to [these recommendations] THIS TITLE to
 receive contributions and make expenditures in  support  of  the  candi-
 date's campaign for such election.
  11.  (a)  "matchable  contribution" means a contribution not less than
 five dollars and not  more  than  AN  AGGREGATE  OF  two  hundred  fifty
 dollars[, for a candidate for public office to be voted on by the voters
 of the entire state or for nomination to any such office, a contribution
 for  any  covered  elections  held in the same election cycle, made by a
 natural person who is a resident in the state of New York to  a  partic-
 ipating  candidate, and for a candidate for election to the state assem-
 bly or state senate or for nomination to any such office, a contribution
 for any covered elections held in the same election  cycle,  made  by  a
 natural  person  who  is also a resident of such state assembly or state
 senate district from which  such  candidate  is  seeking  nomination  or
 election,] PER UNIQUE CONTRIBUTOR, MADE TO A PARTICIPATING CANDIDATE FOR
 ANY  COVERED  ELECTION  HELD  IN  THE SAME ELECTION CYCLE, that has been
 reported in full to the PCFB in  accordance  with  sections  14-102  and
 14-104  of  this  article by the candidate's authorized committee [and],
 has been contributed on or before the day  of  the  applicable  primary,
 general,  runoff,  or  special election, AND: (I) IS FOR A CANDIDATE FOR
 PUBLIC OFFICE TO BE VOTED ON BY THE VOTERS OF THE ENTIRE  STATE  OR  FOR
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 NOMINATION TO ANY SUCH OFFICE, AND HAS BEEN MADE BY A NATURAL PERSON WHO
 IS  A  RESIDENT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK; OR (II) IS FOR A CANDIDATE FOR
 ELECTION TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY OR STATE SENATE OR FOR NOMINATION TO  ANY
 SUCH  OFFICE,  AND HAS BEEN MADE BY A NATURAL PERSON WHO IS ALSO A RESI-
 DENT OF SUCH STATE ASSEMBLY OR STATE  SENATE  DISTRICT  FOR  WHICH  SUCH
 CANDIDATE  IS SEEKING NOMINATION OR ELECTION. Any contribution, contrib-
 utions, or a portion of a contribution  determined  to  be  invalid  for
 matching  funds  by  the PCFB may not be treated as a matchable contrib-
 ution for any purpose.
  (b) The following contributions are not matchable:
  (i) loans;
  (ii) in-kind contributions of property, goods, or services;
  (iii) contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item
 with significant intrinsic and enduring value;
  (iv) transfers from a party or constituted committee;
  (v) anonymous contributions;
  (vi) contributions whose source is not itemized as required by  [these
 recommendations] THIS TITLE;
  (vii) contributions gathered during a previous election cycle;
  (viii) illegal contributions;
  (ix) contributions from minors;
  (x)  contributions  from  vendors for campaigns hired by the candidate
 for such election cycle;
  (xi) contributions from lobbyists registered pursuant  to  subdivision
 (a) of section one-c of the legislative law; and
  (xii)  any  portion of a contribution when the aggregate contributions
 WITHIN THE ELECTION CYCLE are in excess of  two  hundred  fifty  dollars
 from  any one contributor to such participating candidate for nomination
 or election.
  19. "surplus" means those funds where the total sum  of  contributions
 received and public [matchable] MATCHING funds received by a participat-
 ing  candidate  and  his  or  her authorized committee exceeds the total
 campaign expenditures of such candidate and authorized committee for all
 covered elections held in the  same  calendar  year  or  for  a  special
 election to fill a vacancy.
  §  2.  Subparagraphs (iii), (iv), and (v) of paragraph (i) of subdivi-
 sion 1 and subdivision 2 of section 14-203 of the election law, as added
 by section 4 of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, are  amended
 to read as follows:
  (iii) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a candi-
 date  who  retains  funds  raised  during any previous election cycle to
 forfeit such funds. Funds raised during a previous election cycle may be
 retained and used by the candidate for the candidate's campaign  in  the
 next  election  cycle  but  funds  shall  not qualify for satisfying the
 threshold for participating  in  the  public  campaign  finance  program
 established in this title nor shall they be eligible to be matched. [The
 PCFB  shall  adopt  regulations  to ensure that contributions that would
 satisfy the applicable contribution  limits  authorized  in  this  title
 shall  be  transferred  into  the  appropriate  campaign  account.] ONLY
 CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOULD  SATISFY  THE  APPLICABLE  CONTRIBUTION  LIMITS
 AUTHORIZED  BY  THIS  TITLE  SHALL  BE  TRANSFERRED INTO THE APPROPRIATE
 CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT. THE PCFB SHALL ADOPT REGULATIONS TO ENSURE  COMPLIANCE
 WITH THIS SUBPARAGRAPH.
  (iv)  Contributions received and expenditures made by the candidate or
 an authorized committee of the candidate prior to the effective date  of
 this  title  shall  not constitute a violation of this title. Unexpended
 A. 1425  3
 
 contributions shall be treated the same as  [campaign  surpluses]  FUNDS
 RAISED DURING A PREVIOUS ELECTION CYCLE under subparagraph (iii) of this
 paragraph.  Nothing  in this recommendation shall be construed to limit,
 in  any way, any candidate or public official from expending any portion
 of pre-existing campaign funds for any lawful purpose other  than  those
 related to his or her campaign.
  (v)  A  candidate  who  has raised matchable contributions but, in the
 case of a covered primary, general or special election, is  not  opposed
 by  another  candidate on the ballot who is not a write-in candidate, or
 who chooses not to accept [matchable] MATCHING funds,  may  retain  such
 contributions  and  apply  them  in accord with this title to the candi-
 date's next campaign, should there be one, in the next election cycle.
  2. Threshold for eligibility. (a) The threshold  for  eligibility  for
 public funding for participating candidates shall be in the case of:
  (i)  governor, not less than five hundred thousand dollars in contrib-
 utions [including at least five thousand matchable  contributions  shall
 be counted toward this qualifying threshold] FROM RESIDENTS OF THE STATE
 OF  NEW YORK, INCLUDING MATCHABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AT LEAST FIVE THOU-
 SAND UNIQUE CONTRIBUTORS;
  (ii) lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller,  not  less
 than  one  hundred thousand dollars in contributions [including at least
 one thousand matchable contributions shall be counted toward this quali-
 fying threshold] FROM RESIDENTS OF THE  STATE  OF  NEW  YORK,  INCLUDING
 MATCHABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND UNIQUE CONTRIBUTORS;
  (iii)  state senator, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of
 this subdivision, not less than twelve thousand dollars in contributions
 [including at least one hundred fifty matchable contributions  shall  be
 counted toward this qualifying threshold] FROM RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT
 IN  WHICH  THE  SEAT  IS TO BE FILLED, INCLUDING MATCHABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
 FROM AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY UNIQUE CONTRIBUTORS; and
  (iv) member of the assembly, except as otherwise provided in paragraph
 (c) of this subdivision, not less than six thousand dollars in  contrib-
 utions [including at least seventy-five matchable contributions shall be
 counted toward this qualifying threshold] FROM RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT
 IN  WHICH  THE  SEAT  IS TO BE FILLED, INCLUDING MATCHABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
 FROM AT LEAST SEVENTY-FIVE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTORS.
  (b) However, solely for purposes of achieving the monetary  thresholds
 in  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision,  the  first two hundred fifty
 dollars of any contribution of more than two hundred fifty dollars to  a
 candidate  or a candidate's committee which would otherwise be matchable
 except that it comes from a contributor who has  contributed  more  than
 two hundred fifty dollars to such candidate or candidate's committee, is
 deemed  to be a matchable contribution and shall count toward satisfying
 such monetary threshold but shall not otherwise be considered a  matcha-
 ble contribution.
  (c)  With  respect  to  the minimum dollar threshold for participating
 candidates for state senate and state assembly, in such districts  where
 [average  median  income  ("AMI")  is below the AMI as determined by the
 United States Census Bureau three years before such election  for  which
 public  funds are sought] THE AVERAGE OF THE DISTRICT'S MEDIAN INCOME AS
 DETERMINED BY THE BUREAU OF THE CENSUS OF THE UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT
 OF  COMMERCE  FOR  THE  THREE  YEARS PRIOR TO SUCH ELECTION IS BELOW THE
 MEDIAN INCOME FOR THE STATE ACCORDING TO THE  MOST  RECENT  CENSUS  DATA
 AVAILABLE,  such  minimum  dollar  threshold  for  eligibility  shall be
 reduced by one-third. The PCFB shall make  public  which  districts  are
 A. 1425  4
 
 subject  to  such  reduction  no  later  than two years before the first
 primary election for which funding is sought.
  (d)  Any participating candidate meeting the threshold for eligibility
 in a primary  election  for  one  of  the  foregoing  offices  shall  be
 [applied]  DEEMED  to  satisfy  the  threshold  for eligibility for such
 office in any other subsequent election held in the same calendar  year.
 Any  participating  candidate who is nominated in a primary election and
 has participated in the public  financing  program  set  forth  in  this
 title[,  must] SHALL ALSO participate IN THE PUBLIC FINANCING PROGRAM in
 the general election for such office.
  § 3. Subdivisions 2 and 4 of section 14-205 of the  election  law,  as
 added  by  section  4 of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, are
 amended to read as follows:
  2. Calculation of payment. (a) In any election for a public office  to
 be  voted  on by the voters of the entire state or for nomination to any
 such office, if the threshold for eligibility is met, the  participating
 candidate's  authorized  committee  shall  receive payment for qualified
 campaign expenditures of six dollars of public matching funds  for  each
 one dollar of matchable contributions, obtained and reported to the PCFB
 in  accordance with the provisions of this title. The maximum payment of
 public matching funds shall be limited  to  the  amounts  set  forth  in
 [this] section 14-204 OF THIS TITLE for the covered election.
  (b)  In  any  election for state senate or state assembly or for nomi-
 nation to any such office, if the threshold for eligibility is met,  the
 participating candidate's authorized committee shall receive payment for
 qualified  campaign expenditures for matchable contributions of eligible
 private funds per contributor, obtained, and reported to the PCFB  here-
 in,  of:  twelve  dollars of public matching funds for each of the first
 fifty dollars of matchable contributions; nine dollars of public  match-
 ing  funds  for each of the next one hundred dollars of public matchable
 contributions; and eight dollars for [the] each of the next one  hundred
 dollars of public matchable contributions. The maximum payment of public
 matching funds shall be limited to the amounts set forth in this section
 for the covered election.
  4.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
 amount of public funds payable  to  a  participating  candidate  on  the
 ballot in any covered election shall not exceed one-quarter of the maxi-
 mum  public  funds  payment  otherwise  applicable [and no participating
 candidate shall be eligible to receive a disbursement  of  public  funds
 prior  to two weeks after the last day to file designating petitions for
 a primary election] unless the participating candidate is opposed  by  a
 competitive  candidate.  The PCFB shall, by regulation, set forth objec-
 tive standards to determine whether a candidate is competitive  and  the
 procedures for qualifying for the payment of public funds.
  §  4.  Subdivisions  1 and 2 of section 14-207 of the election law, as
 added by section 4 of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws  of  2020,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  There  shall  be  a public campaign finance board within the state
 board of elections that shall be comprised of the following  commission-
 ers:  the  four  state  board of elections commissioners and three addi-
 tional commissioners, one jointly appointed by the  legislative  leaders
 of  one  major  political  party  in  each house of the legislature, one
 jointly appointed by the legislative leaders of the  other  major  poli-
 tical  party  in each house of the legislature, and one of whom shall be
 appointed by the governor. Each commissioner must be a  New  York  state
 resident  and  registered voter, and may not currently be, or within the
 A. 1425  5
 
 previous five years have been, an officer of a political party or  poli-
 tical  committee  as defined in the election law, or a registered lobby-
 ist. The chair of the PCFB shall be designated by the  PCFB  from  among
 the three additional commissioners. Each of the three additional commis-
 sioners shall receive a per diem of three hundred fifty dollars for work
 actually performed not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars in any one
 calendar  year. They shall be considered public officers for purposes of
 sections seventy-three-a and seventy-four of the  public  officers  law.
 The  three  commissioners  so  appointed pursuant to this recommendation
 will be appointed for a term of five years to commence  on  July  first,
 two thousand twenty and may be removed by his or her appointing authori-
 ty  solely  for substantial neglect of duty, gross misconduct in office,
 OR inability to discharge the power or duties of office,  after  written
 notice and opportunity to be heard. During the period of his or her term
 as  a commissioner appointed hereunder, each such commissioner is barred
 from making, or soliciting from  other  persons,  any  contributions  to
 candidates for election to the offices of governor, lieutenant governor,
 attorney general, comptroller, member of the assembly, or state senator.
 Any  vacancy occurring on the PCFB shall be filled within thirty days of
 its occurrence in the same manner as the member whose vacancy  is  being
 filled  was  appointed.  A  person appointed to fill a vacancy occurring
 other than by expiration of a term of office shall be appointed for  the
 unexpired  term  of  the  member he or she succeeds. Four members of the
 PCFB shall constitute a quorum, and the PCFB shall have the power to act
 by majority vote of the total number of members of the commission  with-
 out  vacancy.  All  members of the PCFB shall be appointed no later than
 the first day of July, two thousand twenty and the PCFB shall promulgate
 such regulations as are needed no later than the first day of July,  two
 thousand twenty-one.
  2.  The  PCFB  and state board of elections may utilize existing state
 board of elections staff and hire such other staff as are  necessary  to
 carry  out its duties. It may expand its staffing, as needed, to provide
 additional candidate liaisons to assist candidates in complying with the
 terms of this public campaign finance system as provided for  in  [these
 recommendations]  THIS  TITLE, as well as auditors, trainers, attorneys,
 technical staff and other such staff as the PCFB determines is necessary
 to administer this system. Annually, on or before  the  first  of  every
 year,  the  PCFB  shall  submit  to the governor and the division of the
 budget a request for appropriations for the next state  fiscal  year  to
 fully  support the administration of the public campaign finance program
 established in this title.
  § 5. Paragraph (a) of subdivision  2  and  subdivision  3  of  section
 14-208 of the election law, as added by section 4 of part ZZZ of chapter
 58 of the laws of 2020, are amended to read as follows:
  (a)  If  the PCFB determines that any portion of the payment made to a
 candidate's authorized committee from the fund  was  in  excess  of  the
 aggregate amount of payments that such candidate was eligible to receive
 pursuant  to this title, it shall notify such committee and such commit-
 tee shall pay to the PCFB an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  excess
 payments.  Such  committee  shall first utilize [the surplus] ANY EXCESS
 PAYMENTS OF THE PUBLIC MATCHING FUNDS for repayment  of  such  sums  and
 then  such  other  funds  as it may have. Provided, however, that if the
 erroneous payment was the result of an error by the PCFB, then the erro-
 neous payment will be deducted from any future payment, if any,  and  if
 no  future  payment  is  to  be  made then neither the candidate nor the
 committee shall be liable to repay the excess amount to  the  PCFB.  The
 A. 1425  6

 candidate  and  the  candidate's  authorized  committee  are jointly and
 severally liable for any repayments to the PCFB.
  3.  Rules  and  regulations. (a) The PCFB shall promulgate regulations
 for the certification of the amount of funds payable by the  comptroller
 from  the fund established pursuant to section ninety-two-t of the state
 finance law, to a participating candidate that has qualified to  receive
 such  payment.  These  regulations  shall  include  the promulgation and
 distribution of forms on which contributions and expenditures are to  be
 reported,  the  periods during which such reports must be filed, and the
 verification required. The PCFB shall institute  procedures  which  will
 make  possible  payment  by  the  fund  within [four business days after
 receipt of  the  required  forms  and  verifications]  THE  TIME  LIMITS
 PROVIDED IN SECTION 14-205 OF THIS TITLE.
  (b)  All rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this [recommen-
 dation] TITLE shall be promulgated pursuant to the state  administrative
 procedure  act.  The  PCFB's determinations pursuant to such regulations
 and [these recommendations] THIS TITLE shall be deemed final.
  § 6. Subdivision 1 of section 14-209 of the election law, as added  by
 section  4  of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. Civil penalties. Violations  of  any  provisions  regarding  public
 campaign financing stated in this title or regulation promulgated pursu-
 ant  to  this title shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not
 in excess of fifteen thousand dollars and such other lesser fines as the
 PCFB may promulgate in regulation.  SUCH REGULATIONS  SHALL  INCLUDE  A
 SCHEDULE OF FINES FOR ALLEGED FAILURES TO FILE, LATE REPORTS AND NOTICED
 DEFICIENCIES,  INCLUDING  FINES  THAT  THE  PCFB  MAY ASSESS DIRECTLY ON
 VIOLATORS. Candidates  may  contest  alleged  [failures  to  file,  late
 reports  and  reports  with noticed deficiencies and have an opportunity
 to] INFRACTIONS AND MAY be heard by the PCFB IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBDIVI-
 SION TWO OF THIS  SECTION.  [The  PCFB  shall  promulgate  a  regulation
 setting  forth  a schedule of fines for such infractions including those
 that it may assess directly on violators.] The  PCFB  shall  investigate
 referrals and complaints. After investigation, it may recommend dismiss-
 al,  settlement,  civil action, or referral to law enforcement. The PCFB
 may assess penalties and it is authorized to commence a civil action  in
 court to enforce all penalties and recover money due.
  § 7. Section 14-212 of the election law, as added by section 4 of part
 ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  § 14-212. Severability.  1. IF ANY CLAUSE, SENTENCE, PARAGRAPH, SUBDI-
 VISION, SECTION OR PART OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY ANY COURT
 OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE INVALID, SUCH JUDGMENT SHALL NOT AFFECT,
 IMPAIR OR INVALIDATE THE REMAINDER THEREOF, BUT SHALL BE CONFINED IN ITS
 OPERATION TO THE PARTICULAR CLAUSE,  SENTENCE,  PARAGRAPH,  SUBDIVISION,
 SECTION OR PART THEREOF DIRECTLY FOUND INVALID IN THE JUDGMENT RENDERED.
 IT  IS  HEREBY  DECLARED  TO  BE THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS
 ARTICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENACTED EVEN IF SUCH INVALID PROVISIONS HAD  NOT
 BEEN INCLUDED HEREIN.
  2.  If  any  clause,  sentence,  or  other portion of paragraph (c) of
 subdivision two of section 14-203 of this title be adjudged by any court
 of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, then  subparagraphs  (iii)  and
