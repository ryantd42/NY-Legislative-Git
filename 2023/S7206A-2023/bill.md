  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 S. 7206--A  9
 
 probation officers assumed to elect one  of  the  PO  25-Year  Plans  is
 summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  233
  - Average Age:  52.6
  - Average Service:  25.4
  - Average Salary:  88,200
 
  IMPACT  ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed legislation
 would provide the following benefits to Probation Officers  who  partic-
 ipate in the PO 25-Year Plans:
  o  Service  retirement  benefit  equal  to 55% of Final Average Salary
 (FAS) for the first 25 years of Allowable Service, plus 1.7% of FAS  for
 each  additional  year  of  Allowable Service exceeding 25 years up to a
 maximum of 30 years.
  o Vested benefit equal to 2.2%  of  FAS  for  each  year  of  Credited
 Service.
  The  FAS  is  based  on  a three-year average for Tier 4 members and a
 five-year average for Tier 6 members.
  Members of the PO 25-Year Plans would be required  to  pay  Additional
 Member  Contributions  (AMC)  equal  to  6.75%  of  compensation for all
 service as a Plan participant on and after the starting date of the Plan
 until the later of the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the
 Plans or 30 years of Credited Service.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement system. In addition:
  o The rates of retirement for the PO 25-Year Plans were assigned based
 on members' eligibility to elect or opt out of the plan. The PO  25-Year
 Plan  will  be  optional  for current probation officers. Future members
 would be mandated into the PO 25-Year Plan.
  o New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll  for  probation  officers increases by 3% each year. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement. Future members would be mandated into  the  PO  25-Year
 Plan.
  To  determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed legis-
 lation, a subgroup of NYCERS Probation Officers was developed  based  on
 who is assumed to benefit actuarially by comparing the net present value
 of  future  employer  costs of each member's benefit under their current
 plan and under the applicable PO 25-Year Plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
