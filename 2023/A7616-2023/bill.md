 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. SANTABARBARA -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Tier IV status in the New  York  state
  and local employees' retirement system for Marc Del Prado
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  the  law  to  the
 contrary,  Marc  Del  Prado,  an  employee of the New York state justice
 center for the protection of people with special needs and a  member  of
 the  New  York  state  and  local  employees' retirement system, who was
 employed as a lifeguard with the Mohonasen Central School District  from
 August  2, 2004 until September 29, 2009, as well as a coach for periods
 between November 7, 2011 and  November  7,  2013  who  for  reasons  not
 ascribable  to  his  own  negligence,  failed to become a member of such
 retirement system during such  employment  with  the  Mohonasen  Central
 School  District  in  2004,  shall be deemed to have joined the New York
 state and local employees' retirement system on the date August 2,  2004
 and shall be granted Tier IV status in such retirement system, if, with-
 in  one  year of the effective date of this act, he shall file a written
 request with the state comptroller.
  § 2. No contributions made to the New York state and local  employees'
 retirement system by Marc Del Prado shall be returned or refunded to him
 pursuant to this act.
  §  3. All past service costs of implementing the provision of this act
 shall be borne by the state of New York.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would grant retroactive Tier 4 status in the New York  State
 and Local Employees' Retirement System to Marc Del Prado, a current Tier
 6  member  employed  by  the  New  York  State  Justice  Center  for the
 Protection of People with Special  Needs,  by  changing  their  date  of

 membership to August 2, 2004. There will be no refund of member contrib-
 utions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $4,400 in the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of Marc Del Prado change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $63,700 which will be
 borne by the State of New York as a one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
