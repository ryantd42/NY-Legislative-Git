 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the administrative code of the  city  of  New  York,  in
  relation to promotions of lieutenants
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 14-114 of the administrative code of  the  city  of
 New York is amended by adding a new subdivision d to read as follows:
  D. WHEN A LIEUTENANT SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT FOR A
 PERIOD OF FIFTEEN YEARS, HE OR SHE SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN RESPECT
 TO THE POLICE PENSION FUND AS A LIEUTENANT DETAILED TO ACT AS LIEUTENANT
 COMMANDER DETECTIVE SQUAD OR LIEUTENANT SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Administrative
 Code of the City of New York Section 14-114 to allow for a Lieutenant of
 the New York City Police Department (NYPD), who has  been  a  Lieutenant
 for  at  least  15  years, to have the same rights in respect to the New
 York City Police Pension Fund (POLICE) as a Lieutenant detailed  to  act
 as  a Lieutenant Commander Detective Squad or Lieutenant Special Assign-
 ment.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: The proposed legislation would permit  Lieutenants
 who have served in the rank of Lieutenant for at least 15 years, to have
 their pension calculations based on a higher-grade salary.
  A  Lieutenant,  assuming a service retirement benefit with 20 years of
 service (15 of which was in the title of a Lieutenant), who would  bene-
 fit  under  this  proposed  legislation,  if  enacted,  would receive an
 increase in their annual pension benefit,  due  to  the  assumed  higher
 salary grade and overtime, of approximately $8,500 per year.

  Based on this increase and an estimate of the number of POLICE members
 that are expected to be impacted by this change, it is estimated that if
 this  proposed  legislation  is  enacted,  the annual increase in POLICE
 pension benefits paid will be approximately $227,000 per year.
  With  respect  to  an individual member, the impact on benefits due to
 this proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on  the  member's
 age, years of service, retirement cause, and Tier.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the actuarial assumptions
 and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation
 would increase the Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB)  by  approxi-
 mately $2.9 million every year.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: Enactment of this
 proposed legislation would increase employer contributions,  where  such
 amount  would  depend on the number of members affected as well as other
 characteristics including the age, years of service, and salary  history
 of  the  member. Future years' costs would depend on the number of reti-
 rees who benefit under the legislation amongst other factors.
  The estimate of the increase  in  annual  employer  contributions  for
 Fiscal  Years  2025  through 2029, assuming a homogeneous population and
 consistent retirement pattern, is shown in the table below.
  Fiscal  Increase in
  Year  Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  2025  $ 0.3
  2026  $ 0.7
  2027  $ 1.0
  2028  $ 1.4
  2029  $ 1.7
 
  Since the number of Lieutenants who will retire with 15 or more  years
 in  rank  cannot  be  known in advance with credibility, the increase in
 PVFB due to this legislation has been treated as an actuarial  loss  and
 was  amortized  over a closed 15-year period (14 payments under the One-
 Year Lag Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: These estimates are based on data provided  by  the  NYPD
 Lieutenants Benevolent Association which was not audited but was checked
 for reasonableness. Below is a summary of the data provided:
  *  Salary (excluding overtime)
  o  Lieutenant - $135,511
  o  Lieutenant Commander of Detective Squad and Lieutenant
  Special Assignment -  $149,067
  *  Lieutenants  who  retired  with 15+ years in rank - 38 retired from
 January 1, 2021 through January 1, 2023.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of POLICE.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2023  actuarial
 valuation  of POLICE used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2025.
  The salaries for Lieutenants provided  for  this  analysis  have  been
 adjusted  by  6.61%  for assumed salary increases prior to June 30, 2022
 consistent with contract settlements and assumptions of pattern bargain-
 ing.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 A. 7740  3
 
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
