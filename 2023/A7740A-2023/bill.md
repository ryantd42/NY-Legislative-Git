  Projected contributions are based on historical experience for Tier 2
  members. Future retirement
  experience may differ as Tier 3 members begin to retire.
 
  The entire increase in employer contributions will be allocated to New
 York City.
 
  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
 
  The enactment of this proposed legislation is expected to increase the
 Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $3.5 million in
 the first year and every year thereafter. Each year's PVFB increase will
 depend  on  the  actual  experience  of  benefiting retirees and will be
 recognized in the year benefits are first payable.
 
  AMORTIZATION OF UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITY
 
  Recognized as Ongoing Gain/Loss  POLICE
 
  Number of Payments:  14
  Fiscal Year of Last Payment:  N/A
  First-year Amortization Payment:  $0.4 M
 
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based on data provided
 by the Police Pension Fund which was not audited  but  was  checked  for
 reasonableness.
  Historical  experience was used to estimate the number of retirees who
 could potentially benefit from this proposed legislation and  is  summa-
 rized below.
  *  Lieutenants  who  retired after serving in such rank for 15 years -
 127 retired over the past five years.
 A. 7740--A  3
 
  The average age of all lieutenants who  retired  over  the  past  five
 years is 50.2 for males and 49.1 for females, where approximately 88% of
 retirees were male.
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS:  The  proposed  legislation would permit
 police lieutenants, who have served in such rank for at least 15  years,
 to  have  their pension calculations based on the salary for the rank of
 lieutenant commander of detective squad or  lieutenant  special  assign-
 ment.
  With  respect  to  an individual member, the impact on benefits due to
 this proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on  the  member's
 age, years of service, retirement cause, and Tier.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the  impacted
 retirement systems. In addition:
  *  Future  retirement  patterns were assumed to remain consistent with
 prior experience.  The number of lieutenants who retire after serving in
 such rank for 15 years was assumed to be 30 per year.
  * For police lieutenants who retire  and  benefit  from  the  proposed
 legislation  in  the  first year, annual pension benefits are assumed to
 increase by $9,000 for Tier 2 members and $8,700  for  Tier  3  members.
 Each  year  thereafter,  annual  pension  benefits  for new retirees are
 assumed to increase by an additional 3% per year.
  * For police lieutenants who benefit from  the  proposed  legislation,
 the  assumed  number  of  retirements  for  each gender, and the assumed
 retirement ages for each gender are assumed to remain the same.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
