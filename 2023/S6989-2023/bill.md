 the description of the property subject to the lien, the nature  of  the
 proposed  sale,  a  demand  for payment within a specified time not less
 than [thirty] SIXTY days from mailing of the notice  and  a  conspicuous
 statement  that unless the claimant pays within that time the goods will
 be advertised for sale and sold at public or private sale in  a  commer-
 cially  reasonable manner. The notice shall further include the time and
 place of any public or private sale and it shall state that  any  person
 claiming  an  interest  in  the  goods is entitled to bring a proceeding
 hereunder within ten days of the service of the notice  if  he  disputes
 the  validity  of  the  lien, or the amount claimed. The notice shall be
 personally delivered to the occupant, or sent by registered or certified
 mail to the occupant's last known address, or sent by verified mail  and
 electronic  mail  to  the occupant's last known address. Any notice made
 pursuant to this section and sent by verified mail shall be sent to  the
 last  known  address provided by the occupant, pursuant to the occupancy
 agreement, PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT IF THE OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT STATES THAT
 THE OCCUPANT HAS CHOSEN TO BE CONTACTED VIA TELEPHONE AS  SET  FORTH  IN
 SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS  SECTION,  SUCH NOTICE SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE
 UNLESS THE OWNER MAKES REASONABLE ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE  OCCUPANT  VIA
 TELEPHONE  TO  NOTIFY  THE  OCCUPANT  OF THE MAILING OF SUCH NOTICE. Any
 notice made pursuant to this section and sent by electronic  mail  shall
 only  be effective if: (i) the occupancy agreement states that the occu-
 pant has consented to receive late or lien notices by  electronic  mail;
 and  (ii)  the  occupant  has  provided  the  occupant's electronic mail
 address in at least two locations within the occupancy agreement.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
