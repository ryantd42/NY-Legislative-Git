 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education law, in relation to the attendance of
  minors upon full  day  instruction  and  the  conditions  under  which
  districts, including the city school district of the city of New York,
  are  entitled  to  an  apportionment  of  state aid and the closure of
  schools due in response to the novel coronavirus, COVID-19
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  7  of  section 3604 of the education law, as
 amended by chapter 107 of the laws  of  2020,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  7.  No district shall be entitled to any portion of such school moneys
 on such apportionment unless the report of  the  trustees  or  board  of
 education  for  the  preceding  school  year  shall show that the public
 schools were actually in session in the district and taught by a  quali-
 fied  teacher or by successive qualified teachers or by qualified teach-
 ers for not less than one hundred eighty days. The moneys payable  to  a
 school  district  pursuant  to section thirty-six hundred nine-a of this
 part in the current year shall be reduced by one  one-hundred  eightieth
 of  the  district's  total foundation aid for the base year for each day
 less than one hundred eighty days that the schools of the district  were
 actually  in  session,  except  that the commissioner may disregard such
 reduction in the apportionment of public money: (i) for any day or  days
 on  which  session  had been previously scheduled but the superintendent
 was required to close the school or schools due to a  properly  executed
 declaration  of  a state or local state of emergency pursuant to article
 two-B of the executive law; or (ii) for up to five days  if  he  or  she
 finds  that  the  schools  of  the  district were not in session for one
 hundred eighty days because of extraordinarily  adverse  weather  condi-
 tions,  impairment of heating facilities, insufficiency of water supply,

 shortage of fuel, lack of electricity, natural gas leakage, unacceptable
 levels of chemical substances, a credible threat to  student  safety  as
 reasonably  determined by a lead school official or the destruction of a
 school building either in whole or in part, and if, further, the commis-
 sioner  finds that such district cannot make up such days of instruction
 by using for the secondary grades  all  scheduled  vacation  days  which
 occur  prior to the first scheduled regents examination day in June, and
 for the elementary grades all scheduled vacation days which occur  prior
 to  the last scheduled regents examination day in June; or (iii) for any
 day or days in the two thousand nineteen -- two thousand  twenty  school
 year  OR  THE  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO--TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE SCHOOL
 YEAR on which session had been previously scheduled but  the  chancellor
 of  the  city school district of the city of New York or the superinten-
 dent of a district closed the school or schools due to  a  determination
 by  the chancellor or superintendent that it was in the best interest of
 public health or safety of the school district to close  the  school  or
 schools in response to the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. For the purposes
 of  this subdivision, "scheduled vacation days" shall mean days on which
 the schools of the district are not in session and for which no prohibi-
 tion exists in subdivision eight of this  section  for  them  to  be  in
 session.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
