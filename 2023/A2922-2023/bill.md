  § 91. Referendum on petition. Any such resolution or act of  the  town

 provided by the  election  law  for  the  authentication  of  nominating
 petitions.  The several sheets so signed and authenticated when fastened
 together and offered for filing shall be deemed to constitute one  peti-
 tion.  If, within five days after the filing of such petition, a written
 objection thereto be filed with the town clerk, and a verified  petition
 setting  forth  the objections be presented by the person so filing such
 objections to the supreme court or any justice thereof of  the  judicial
 district  in  which  such  town is located, such court or justice within
 twenty days shall determine any question  arising  thereunder  and  make

 determined in the manner prescribed by section 16-116  of  the  election
 law.
