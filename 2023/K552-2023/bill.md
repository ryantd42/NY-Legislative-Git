  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Onion Appreciation Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  agricultural  industry  of  the  State of New York is
highly benefited by  the  active  promotion  of  farming  endeavors  and
agricultural products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023, as Onion  Appreciation
Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  nutritional  value  of  onions have been held in high
esteem throughout recorded history, having been  used  in  nearly  every
cuisine around the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Perceived to be one of the oldest known vegetables, onions
are among the first cultivated crops, are easy to grow,  do  well  in  a
wide  range  of  soils and climates, are less perishable than many other
vegetables, and have grown wild in many regions  throughout  the  world;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Food  historians  estimate man has been cultivating onions
for approximately 5,000  years;  it  is  also  estimated  our  ancestors
feasted  on  wild onions for thousands of years before the inventions of
farming and writing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Onions have numerous  medicinal  purposes,  some  of  which
include  the  treatment  of  coughs,  colds,  wounds,  ulcers,  and
hypertension; and
 
  WHEREAS, Modern research supports  a  surprising  array  of  ancient
allium-related  health  claims;  according  to researchers in the United
States and India, onions also kill the germs that cause tooth decay; and
 
  WHEREAS, An absolute asset to society, onions contain  at  least  25
identified active disease combating compounds that, like garlic, possess
antibacterial,  antifungal,  and  immune  enhancing properties which may
explain their efficacy in warding off colds as well as  relieving  upset
stomachs;  they  also  appear  to  lower blood pressure and cholesterol,
inhibit growth of cancer  cells,  reduce  stroke  risk,  and  assist  in
preventing heart disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, All of our Nation's farmers, particularly the onion farmers
of  the  State  of  New  York,  deserve  the  recognition,  support, and
appreciation of all the  citizens  of  this  great  Empire  State;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023,  as  Onion
Appreciation Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
