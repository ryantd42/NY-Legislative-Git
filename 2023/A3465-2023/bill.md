 THOUSAND AND SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND OR  BETWEEN  SIXTY-SEVEN  THOUSAND  AND
 SEVENTY  THOUSAND  AS RECORDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN CENSUS for pupils
 in grades ten through twelve in attendance in career education  programs
 as  such  programs  are  defined  by  the  commissioner, subject for the
 purposes of this paragraph to the approval of the director of the  budg-
 et,  an  amount  for  each  such pupil to be computed by multiplying the
 career education aid ratio by three thousand nine hundred dollars.  Such
 aid  will  be  payable  for  weighted  pupils attending career education
 programs operated by the school district and, FOR CITY SCHOOL  DISTRICTS
 OF  THOSE CITIES HAVING POPULATIONS IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
 THOUSAND AND ANY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH WAS NOT A  COMPONENT  OF  A
 BOARD  OF COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES IN THE BASE YEAR for weighted
 pupils for whom such school district contracts with  boards  of  cooper-
 ative  educational services to attend career education programs operated
 by a board of cooperative educational services. Weighted pupils for  the
 purposes  of  this  paragraph  shall  mean  the sum of the attendance of
 students in grades ten through twelve in career education  sequences  in
 trade,  industrial,  technical, agricultural or health programs plus the
 product of sixteen hundredths multiplied by the attendance  of  students
 in  grades  ten through twelve in career education sequences in business
 and marketing as defined by the commissioner in regulations. The  career
 education  aid ratio shall be computed by subtracting from one the prod-
 uct obtained by multiplying fifty-nine percent by  the  combined  wealth
 ratio.  This  aid ratio shall be expressed as a decimal carried to three
 places without rounding, but not less than thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be required to use such amount to support career education  programs  in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion  reduced  in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current or a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support of career education programs were continued at a level equal  to
 or  greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in the
 preceding school year.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  the
 calculation  of aid for career education payable in the 2023-2024 school
 year and years thereafter.
