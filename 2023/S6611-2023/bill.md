  Section 1.  Legislative intent and findings. Whereas  recent  judicial
 opinions  have  created  confusion  regarding the status of correctional
 facilities and law enforcement agencies as subjects of the  jurisdiction
 of  the  New  York  human  rights  law, the legislature hereby finds and
 declares, for the purposes of the human rights law and the  division  of
 human  rights,  the  services  provided  by law enforcement officers are
 public accommodations, correctional facilities  and  local  correctional
 facilities  are  housing  accommodations,  and law enforcement agencies,
 correctional facilities and local correctional facilities are subject to
 the jurisdiction of the human rights law.
  § 2. Subdivision 10 of section 292 of the executive law, as  added  by
 chapter 340 of the laws of 1955, is amended to read as follows:
  10. The term "housing accommodation" includes any building, structure,
 or portion thereof which is used or occupied or is intended, arranged or
 designed  to  be  used  or  occupied, as the home, residence or sleeping
 place of one or more human beings, INCLUDING ANY  TYPE  OF  CORRECTIONAL
 FACILITY OR LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.
  §  3.  Section  292  of  the  executive law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 42 to read as follows:
  42. THE TERMS "CORRECTIONAL FACILITY" AND "LOCAL CORRECTIONAL  FACILI-
 TY" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN SECTION TWO
 OF THE CORRECTION LAW.
