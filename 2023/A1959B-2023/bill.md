 THE APPLICABILITY OR GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL OF  THE  FOLLOWING

 PRINTED FORM OR MAY BE HANDWRITTEN IN INDELIBLE INK.
  2. AN EMPLOYER SHALL NOTIFY AN EMPLOYEE WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THE EMPLOY-
 ER PLACING IN THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL RECORD  ANY  INFORMATION  TO  THE
 EXTENT  THAT  THE INFORMATION IS, HAS BEEN USED OR MAY BE USED, TO NEGA-
 TIVELY AFFECT THE EMPLOYEE'S QUALIFICATION  FOR  EMPLOYMENT,  PROMOTION,
 TRANSFER,  ADDITIONAL  COMPENSATION OR THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE EMPLOYEE
 WILL BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AN EMPLOYER RECEIVING A  WRITTEN
 REQUEST  FROM  AN  EMPLOYEE  TO  ACCESS SUCH EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL RECORD
 SHALL PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEE WITH A COPY OF SUCH PERSONNEL  RECORD  WITHIN
 FIVE  BUSINESS  DAYS OF SUBMISSION OF A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR SUCH COPY TO
 THE EMPLOYER. AN EMPLOYER SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE  TO

 PERSONNEL RECORD, REMOVAL OR CORRECTION OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE MUTU-
 ALLY AGREED UPON BY THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE. IF  AN  AGREEMENT  IS
 NOT  REACHED, THE EMPLOYEE MAY SUBMIT A WRITTEN STATEMENT EXPLAINING THE
 EMPLOYEE'S POSITION WHICH SHALL BE CONTAINED AND BECOME A PART  OF  SUCH
 EMPLOYEE'S  PERSONNEL  RECORD. THE STATEMENT SHALL BE INCLUDED WHEN SAID
 INFORMATION IS TRANSMITTED TO A THIRD PARTY  AS  LONG  AS  THE  ORIGINAL
 INFORMATION  IS  RETAINED AS PART OF THE FILE. IF AN EMPLOYER PLACES ANY
 INFORMATION IN A PERSONNEL RECORD WHICH SUCH  EMPLOYER  KNEW  OR  SHOULD
 HAVE  KNOWN  TO  BE  FALSE,  THE  EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE REMEDY THROUGH THE
 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, OTHER PERSONNEL PROCEDURES OR  JUDICIAL
 PROCESS  TO  HAVE  SUCH  INFORMATION  EXPUNGED. AN EMPLOYEE MAY BRING AN
 ACTION IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO  HAVE  FALSE  INFORMATION
 REMOVED FROM HIS OR HER PERSONNEL RECORD. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL  NOT  PROHIBIT THE REMOVAL OF INFORMATION CONTAINED IN A PERSONNEL
 RECORD UPON MUTUAL AGREEMENT  OF  THE  EMPLOYER  AND  EMPLOYEE  FOR  ANY
 REASON.

 EE WITH SUCH EMPLOYER. IN ANY CAUSE OF ACTION  BROUGHT  BY  AN  EMPLOYEE
 AGAINST  SUCH EMPLOYER IN ANY ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL PROCEEDING SUCH
 EMPLOYER SHALL RETAIN ANY PERSONNEL RECORD REQUIRED  TO  BE  KEPT  UNDER
 THIS  SECTION  WHICH IS RELEVANT TO SUCH ACTION UNTIL THE FINAL DISPOSI-
 TION THEREOF.
