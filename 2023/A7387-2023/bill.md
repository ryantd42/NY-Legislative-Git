 Introduced by M. of A. CONRAD -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend chapter 560 of the laws of 1998 amending the not-for-
  profit corporation law and other laws,  relating  to  combinations  of
  cemetery  corporations and funeral entities, and the sale of monuments
  and memorials, in relation to the application  of  provisions  of  the
  not-for-profit  corporation law and other laws to certain crematoriums
  located in the town of Tonawanda; and to repeal certain provisions  of
  such chapter relating thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The legislature finds and declares that the public  health,
 safety  and  welfare  of  the  residents of the state of New York in and
 around the town of Tonawanda is a matter of substantial  state  concern.
 The  legislature  also  finds  and  declares  that the state has a vital
 interest in the oversight of places of final disposition as well as  the
 protection  of  its citizens directly affected by such places. The resi-
 dents of the state in the town  of  Tonawanda  have  been  subjected  to
 heightened levels of air pollution due to aging and failing equipment at
 certain  crematoriums.  A crematorium located close to residential areas
 with a consistently poor record of complying with clean air laws, creat-
 ing a hazardous environment for the  citizens  of  the  state  is  to  a
 substantial  degree a matter of state concern. Therefore, the provisions
 hereinafter prescribed are enacted and their  necessity  in  the  public
 interest is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
  §  2.  Subdivision  1 of section 14 of chapter 560 of the laws of 1998
 amending the not-for-profit corporation law and other laws, relating  to
 combinations of cemetery corporations and funeral entities, and the sale
 of  monuments  and  memorials,  as amended by chapter 513 of the laws of
 2021, is amended to read as follows:
