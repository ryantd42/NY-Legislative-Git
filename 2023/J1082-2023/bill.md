  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Jewish American Heritage Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Jewish  American history spans more than 350 years, dating
back to the colonial era and early European settlements in New York, and
is woven through every part of American history through to  the  present
day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  is home to the largest Jewish population in the
United States, and New York's Jewish communities continue to grow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jews  played  an  integral  role  in  supporting  American
independence  and  the religious freedom guaranteed in the establishment
of the new nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beginning in the  mid-1800s,  a  wave  of  European  Jewish
immigrants,  fleeing  persecution and economic hardship in search of new
opportunity, arrived in the United States; this wave of immigration  led
to  the  expansion  of  Jewish  communities  across  the  nation and the
founding of  B'nai  B'rith,  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  and  the
National Council of Jewish Women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  late 1800s and early 1900s, Jewish immigration to
the United States increased  in  response  to  rising  anti-Semitism  in
Europe,  and particularly in response the pogroms in the Russian Empire;
more than two million Eastern European Jews  immigrated  to  the  United
States during this time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Restrictive  immigration  policies  beginning in the 1920s
stemmed the flow of new immigrants to the  United  States;  many  Jewish
Americans opposed these policies, but they remained in place, leading to
the  United  States' tragic refusal to accept refugees from Nazi Germany
and leaving many of them unable to escape the Holocaust; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jewish Americans and  Jewish  immigrants  to  America  have
contributed  to  every aspect of American culture and history, including
education, science, business, philanthropy, politics, civil rights,  and
the  arts;  among  them  are  key figures in American and world history,
including Jonas Salk, Albert Einstein, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg; and
 
  WHEREAS, In light of  continuing  and  reemerging  anti-Semitism  in
America, expressed openly and violently, it is crucial that the history,
heritage,  and  culture  of Jewish Americans be fully known, understood,
and valued; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jewish  American  Heritage  Month  is  an  opportunity  to
celebrate  the  vibrancy  and  importance  of New York's Jewish American
citizens, whose accomplishments and contributions strengthen and  enrich
culture,  governance,  the  economy,  education,  and  all  aspects  of
community life in the State; and
 
  WHEREAS, During Jewish American  Heritage  Month,  New  Yorkers  are
encouraged  to  commemorate  and  celebrate the essential contributions,
sacrifices, and accomplishments that  Jewish  Americans  have  made  and
continue to make in the Commonwealth; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Jewish
American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
