  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 6 of article 3 of the constitution, in
  relation to salary increases for members of the legislature

  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 6 of  article
 3 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  6.  (A) Each member of the legislature shall receive for his or her
 services a like annual salary, to be fixed by law. He or she shall  also
 be  reimbursed  for his or her actual traveling expenses in going to and
 returning from the place in which the legislature meets, not  more  than
 once  each  week while the legislature is in session. Senators, when the
 senate alone is convened in extraordinary session, or  when  serving  as
 members  of the court for the trial of impeachments, and such members of
 the assembly, not exceeding nine in number, as shall be appointed manag-
 ers of an impeachment, shall receive an additional per  diem  allowance,
 to  be  fixed  by law. Any member, while serving as an officer of his or
 her house or in any other special capacity therein or directly connected
 therewith not hereinbefore in this section specified, may also  be  paid
 and  receive,  in  addition, any allowance which may be fixed by law for
 the particular and additional services appertaining to  or  entailed  by
 such  office  or  special capacity. Neither the salary of any member nor
 any other allowance so fixed may be increased or diminished during,  and
 with  respect  to, the term for which he or she shall have been elected,
 nor shall he or she be paid or receive any other extra compensation. The
 provisions of this section and  laws  enacted  in  compliance  therewith
 shall  govern  and be exclusively controlling, according to their terms.
 Members shall continue to receive such salary and  additional  allowance
 as  heretofore  fixed and provided in this section, until changed by law
 pursuant to this section.
  (B) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO  THE  CONTRARY,  ANY
 AMENDMENT  TO  THE  LEGISLATIVE  LAW, OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW THAT

 WOULD RESULT IN THE INCREASE OF SALARY FOR MEMBERS OF  THE  LEGISLATURE,
 SHALL  FIRST  HAVE  BEEN  SUBMITTED  TO  THE  PEOPLE AT THE NEXT GENERAL
 ELECTION AND SHALL HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF  ALL  VOTES  CAST
 FOR  AND  AGAINST  IT  AT  SUCH  GENERAL  ELECTION. UPON APPROVAL BY THE
 PEOPLE, THE AMENDMENT TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE  MEMBER'S  SALARIES  SHALL
 TAKE  EFFECT  IMMEDIATELY.  THE  BALLOTS  TO BE FURNISHED FOR THE USE OF
 VOTERS UPON SUBMISSION SHALL BE IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY  THE  ELECTION
 LAW, AND SHALL SET FORTH THE CURRENT SALARY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGIS-
 LATURE, THE PROPOSED INCREASED PER ANNUM SALARY AND SHALL EXPLICITLY ASK
 "SHALL THE INCREASE IN SALARY BE APPROVED?".
  §  2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment be
 referred to the first regular legislative session  convening  after  the
 next  succeeding  general  election  of members of the assembly, and, in
 conformity with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution,  be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
