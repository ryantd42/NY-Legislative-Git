 Introduced  by Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the state finance law, the economic development law  and
  the  environmental conservation law, in relation to the state procure-
  ment process and to healthy and green procurement

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York
 state healthy and green procurement act".
  § 2. Legislative findings  and  declaration.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds and declares that:
  (a)  As  New York moves into the twenty-first century the state should
 serve as a role model for practices that  will  create  and  maintain  a
 healthy  environment  and  vibrant  economy.  The  manufacture,  use and
 disposal of commodities and technologies, the construction of  buildings
 and the provision of services utilizing toxic chemicals may have adverse
 impacts  on  public health and the environment. Persistent, bioaccumula-
 tive toxic chemicals, such as mercury, lead, dioxin and poly  brominated
 diphenyl  ethers,  are toxic in small amounts, remain in the environment
 for long periods of time, and build to dangerous levels in humans,  fish
 and  other  animals;  and  this  group of pollutants known as persistent
 bioaccumulative toxic chemicals (PBT) pose risks to  public  health  and
 the environment through their ability to cause cancer, birth defects and
 endocrine  disruption.  Such  chemicals  have polluted hundreds of water
 bodies, fish and waterfowl in the state. These  adverse  impacts  impose
 costs  on  the  state and, ultimately, society as a whole in the form of
 injury, disease and death; health care expenses; disposal, liability and
 cleanup costs; the waste of resources and raw materials; and an impaired
 natural environment.  PBT and cancer-causing chemicals may be found in a
 wide range of consumer products purchased by state  agencies,  including
 lighting  supplies,  computers  and  other  office  equipment, vehicles,

 medical equipment, building  supplies  and  printing  inks.  Encouraging
 innovation,  and  creating  and  choosing  the  safest, most sustainable
 commodities, services and technologies will  help  to  ensure  a  higher
 quality of life for present and future generations. It will put New York
 businesses  in an advantageous position to compete in the global market-
 place.
  (b) New York looks forward to the  time  when  the  state's  power  is
 generated  from  renewable  and  clean sources, when our homes, schools,
 businesses  and  government  facilities  are  energy  efficient  and
 constructed, refurbished and maintained using healthy and green products
 and  practices,  when pollution prevention is embraced by government and
 businesses as a way to save money and  protect  public  health  and  the
 environment, when government and citizens use energy efficient and clean
 vehicles,  when pests are controlled with nontoxic or least toxic alter-
 natives, when our production of waste is significantly reduced  and  the
 rest is recycled, and when our homes, schools, workplaces, food, air and
 water are free from toxic contaminants.
  (c)  Protecting  public  health and the environment is consistent with
 the traditional considerations associated with state  procurement  prac-
 tice,  including lowest price, best value, quality, cost and efficiency.
 Determining quality, value and efficiency should include  the  consider-
 ation  of  public  health  and  environmental  impacts. Considering such
 impacts early in the  procurement  process  and  adopting  an  ethic  of
 pollution  prevention  will not only reduce pollution and waste, it will
 reduce costs throughout a commodity, service or technology's life cycle.
  (d) Through the volume of government procurement, government can  play
 a  significant role in spurring private sector development of high value
 commodities and services.  This,  in  turn,  will  create  business  and
 employment  opportunities  in  New  York  state,  foster competition and
 harness the energy of the market to produce products and  services  that
 perform better and cost less. As supply increases, prices will decrease,
 and  high performance, healthy and green commodities, services and tech-
 nologies will become more affordable for all consumers.
  § 3. Subdivision 5 of section 160 of the state finance law,  as  added
 by chapter 83 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  5.  "Costs"  as  used  in  this  article shall be quantifiable and may
 include, without limitation, the price of  the  given  good  or  service
 being  purchased;  the administrative, training, storage, maintenance or
 other overhead associated with a given good or  service;  the  value  of
 warranties, delivery schedules, financing costs and foregone opportunity
 costs  associated  with  a  given good or service; and the life span and
 associated  life  cycle  costs  of  the  given  good  or  service  being
 purchased.  Life  cycle  costs may include, but shall not be limited to,
 costs or savings associated with RAW MATERIALS, PRODUCTION,  MANUFACTUR-
 ING,  construction,  PACKAGING,  DISTRIBUTION,  USE, energy use, mainte-
 nance, operation, and salvage or disposal, AND, IF SUCH  INFORMATION  IS
 READILY  AVAILABLE,  ANY  INDIRECT ASSOCIATED PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRON-
 MENTAL COSTS.
  § 4. Paragraph a of subdivision 1 of section 161 of the state  finance
 law,  as  amended by chapter 452 of the laws of 2012, is amended to read
 as follows:

 ty-one] TWENTY-FIVE members, including the commissioner, the state comp-
