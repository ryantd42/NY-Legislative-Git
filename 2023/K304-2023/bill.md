  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 17-21, 2023, as Work Zone  Awareness  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to increase awareness  of  the  safety
and protection of our Work Zone workers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  17-21,  2023,  as  Work  Zone
Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Work Zone Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Work Zone Awareness Week (NWZAW)  is  intended  to
bring  national  attention  to  motorist  and worker safety and mobility
issues in work zones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  annual  spring  campaign,  held  at  the  start  of
construction season, encourages safe driving through highway work zones,
and encourages drivers to use extra caution in work zones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1999, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has
diligently worked with the American Association  of  State  Highway  and
Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  and  the  American  Traffic  Safety
Services Association (ATSSA) to coordinate and sponsor the event; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's theme, "Work Zones are a Sign  to  Slow  Down",
features a poster with a vehicle driving along a winding road surrounded
by  work  zone  technologies  that make work zones safer for workers and
motorists; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 17-21, 2023, as Work
Zone Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
