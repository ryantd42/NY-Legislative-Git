BY: Senator PARKER
 
  RECOGNIZING  January  12,  2023,  as  National
  Pharmacist Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  recognize  the  important
contributions of individuals who affect the health of  the  citizens  of
this great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize January 12, 2023, as National Pharmacist Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital day focuses on the importance of pharmacists, as
well  as  honors  how  much they impact the health and well-being of all
Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 754 AD, the first pharmacies were established in Baghdad
during the Islamic Golden Age; and
 
  WHEREAS, On September 28, 1928, Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin  which  changed  the  course  of  modern  medicine
significantly, because due to penicillin infections that were previously
untreatable and life threatening were now easily treated; and
 
  WHEREAS, America's largest drug store, CVS, made its debut on May 8,
1963, employing 24,000 pharmacists; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Pharmacist Day honors more than 300,000 employees:
there  were approximately 316,500 pharmacists in the United States as of
2016, and the profession which continues to grow is up  from  less  than
224,000 just 15 years prior; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  profession  is  vital  to  the  economy:  people need
pharmacists  to  keep  them  healthy,  which  keeps  businesses  moving;
American  employers  pay  more  than  $260  billion  each  year  for
health-related work loss; and
 
  WHEREAS,In  addition,  pharmacists  do  much  more  than  dispense
medication:  they  can  give health advice and tips, such as how to take
multiple medications, and they know about drug therapy effectiveness and
can inform individuals about medical devices used at home; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children can get up  to  12  colds  a  year,  while  adults
average  two to four; pharmacists work throughout the year to keep these
children and adults healthy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pharmacists  throughout  the  United  States  have  proven
themselves to be a great asset to medicine and to the health and welfare
of all American citizens; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize January 12, 2023,  as  National  Pharmacist  Day;  and  be  it
further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the United Pharmacy Association.
