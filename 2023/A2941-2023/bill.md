 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to requiring an
  updated photo for the renewal of a driver's license
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the vehi-
 cle and traffic law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws  of  2019,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  A  license  issued  pursuant  to subdivision five of this section
 shall be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless  such
 license  is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be renewed
 by submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by  law,
 proofs  of  prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision prescribed by
 the commissioner, the applicant's social security  number  or,  in  lieu
 thereof,  with  respect  to an application for a non-commercial driver's
 license or learner's permit which does not meet  federal  standards  for
 identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant that they have not
 been  issued  a  social security number, and [if required by the commis-
 sioner,] a photo image of the applicant in such numbers and form as  the
 commissioner shall prescribe. In addition, an applicant for renewal of a
 license  containing a hazardous material endorsement shall pass an exam-
 ination to retain such endorsement. The commissioner shall, with respect
 to the renewal of a hazardous materials  endorsement,  comply  with  the
 requirements  imposed  upon  states  by  sections 383.141 and 1572.13 of
 title 49 of the code of federal regulations. A renewal of  such  license
 shall  be  issued by the commissioner upon approval of such application,
 except that no such license shall be issued if  its  issuance  would  be
 inconsistent with the provisions of section five hundred sixteen of this
 title, and except that the commissioner may refuse to renew such license
 if the applicant is the holder of a currently valid or renewable license
