 AN ACT relating to  a  temporary  in  rem  foreclosure  moratorium;  and
  providing for the repeal of such provisions upon the expiration there-
  of

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the United
 States Supreme Court  Case  of  Tyler  v.  Hennepin  County,  Minnesota,
 decided  on  May  25, 2023, has created legal uncertainty with regard to
 how municipalities must conduct their in  rem  foreclosures  and  return
 funds  to the appropriate parties, when necessary. As such, the legisla-
 ture seeks to find a solution that will provide legal certainty in  this
 process  and ensure the rights of property owners and municipalities are
 adequately protected.
  § 2. 1. No tax district, as defined in subdivision 6 of  section  1102
 of  the  real property tax law, shall commence an in rem tax foreclosure
 proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction against any parcel  or
 parcels  of  real  property  located within the geographic boundaries of
 such tax district until the expiration of  this  moratorium  under  this
 act.
  2.  No  enforcing officer, as defined in subdivision 3 of section 1102
 of the real property tax law, shall convey title to  any  tax-delinquent
 parcel  of  real  property  owned  by a tax district, which has been the
 subject of an in rem tax foreclosure proceeding,  to  the  treasurer  or
 other official of the tax district, in any in rem tax foreclosure action
 which  was filed and adjudicated prior to the effective date of this act
 and prior to its expiration date.
  § 3. This act shall not apply to:
  1. properties owned by a tax district which were acquired at any  time
 after  May 25, 2023 and prior to July 1, 2023, pursuant to article 11 of

 the real property tax law, or where the tax  district  filed  the  final
 foreclosure  judgement order with the court within such time period.  In
 the event that any tax district has acquired  title  to  any  delinquent
 parcel  of real property prior to July 1, 2023 pursuant to an in rem tax
 foreclosure proceeding under article 11 of the real  property  tax  law,
 the  tax district may auction said parcel or parcels contingent upon the
 foreclosing tax district holding any and all surplus funds in  a  segre-
 gated trust account to be maintained by the chief fiscal officer of such
 tax  district  until  such time that this moratorium is repealed on June
 30, 2024; or
  2. a tax district that has  a  mechanism  by  which  the  municipality
 offers  the return of surplus funds to the delinquent tax property owner
 and such municipality: (a) on January 1, 1993, was authorized to enforce
 the collection of delinquent taxes pursuant to a  county  charter,  city
 charter, administrative code or special law; or (b) adopted a local law,
 no  later  than  July  1, 1994 providing that the collection of taxes in
 such county, city or town shall continue to be enforced pursuant to such
 charter, code or special law, as such charter, code or special  law  may
 from  time  to  time  be amended; and (c) filed a copy of such local law
 with the commissioner of taxation and finance no later  than  August  1,
 1994.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed on and after June 30, 2024.
