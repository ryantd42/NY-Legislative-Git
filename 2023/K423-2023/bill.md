  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 9, 2023, as  Teacher  Appreciation  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to highlight the men and women who lend
their passion and skills to educating our children; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 9, 2023, as Teacher Appreciation
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
National Teacher Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  October  5,  1994,  more  than 100 different countries
created the  first  World  Teacher's  Day;  for  decades,  the  National
Parent-Teacher  Association has designated the Tuesday in the first full
week of May as Teacher Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, This day focuses on the teachers who work  to  make  public
schools  great  places  for  students  to succeed in life, as well as to
honor teachers and recognize the lasting contributions they make in  the
lives of their students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  America's  public-school system, there are 3.2 million
full-time-equivalent teachers as of 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our teachers are more than purveyors of  knowledge  in  the
classroom,  they  also serve our students as role models and mentors and
positively impact the lives of students well beyond the classroom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Few  other  professionals  touch  as  many  people  as  do
teachers;  the  last two years, the Teacher Appreciation Day celebration
took on new meaning as educators stepped up  in  unprecedented  ways  to
meet  their  students'  academic and emotional needs during the COVID-19
pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of  this  great  Empire  State  recognize  our
teachers  educate  and  nurture all students to be responsible citizens,
critical thinkers and life-long learners to successfully compete in  the
global marketplace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize the
educators of New York State who work to open the minds of their students
to new ideas, knowledge and dreams; who keep American democracy alive by
laying the foundation for good citizenship; who fill many roles such  as
listeners,  explorers,  role  models,  motivators  and  mentors; and who
continue to influence their students long after the school days are only
memories; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 9, 2023, as Teacher
Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
