 AN ACT creating a legislative task force on outdoor environmental educa-
  tion and recreation that will benefit residents of New York  state  by
  stewardship  and  conservation  of the environment, an appreciation of
  the importance of the  wise  use  of  natural  resources  as  well  as

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. (a) The legislature hereby finds that
 in the last two decades, childhood has moved indoors. The average Ameri-
 can boy or girl spends just four to seven minutes each day  in  unstruc-
 tured  outdoor  play,  and more than seven hours each day in front of an
 electronic screen. The decline in the  appreciation  and  prevalence  of
 outdoor  recreation opportunities profoundly impacts the wellness of our
 state's youth. The  correlation  between  increasing  childhood  obesity
 rates and the decline in outdoor recreation is undeniable.
  (b)  The  legislature further finds that visual and physical access to
 basic types of open space is vital for everyone, and particularly  valu-
 able to children growing up in "urban hardscapes", or areas where access
 to nature is limited.
  (c)  The  legislature  further  finds that the development of policies
 that foster stewardship of the environment, the importance of  the  wise
 use  of natural resources and recognition of the health benefits of time
 spent in nature are essential to the residents of New  York  state.  The
 legislature concludes that this can best be accomplished by the creation
 of a task force on outdoor environmental education and recreation.
  §  2.  Objectives.  A  legislative task force on outdoor environmental
 education and recreation is hereby established to:
  (a) Promote the development of a framework that will ensure  that  New
 York  state has an aggressive outdoor environmental education and recre-

 ation plan for children that focuses on creating, developing and retain-
 ing opportunities for outdoor play and learning;
  (b)  Identify  and  support  programs  which offer safe access to open
 spaces and summer camp to children from urban areas;
  (c) Promote the development of policy recommendations to  ensure  that
 New  York's  public  and private sectors focus on creating opportunities
 for underserved and at-risk children to participate in outdoor play  and
 educational experiences;
  (d)  Promote  the development of strategies to ensure that K-12 educa-
 tional institutions develop policies and programs that promote  environ-
 mental  education  to  encourage  outdoor  play thereby improving public
 health and take advantage of the physical, mental and spiritual benefits
 of moving outdoors in nature;
  (e) Promote the development of strategies to assist  community  based,
 nonprofit  organizations  in furthering programs that provide for summer
 camp and out of school time  opportunities  for  outdoor  recreation  or
 education;
  (f)  Evaluate  laws, rules, and procedures to ensure that they facili-
 tate, or at least do not hinder, the growth of outdoor play or  environ-
 mental education.
