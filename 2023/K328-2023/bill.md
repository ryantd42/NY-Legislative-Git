  COMMENDING  Megan  and  Clayton  Kappauf  upon the
  occasion of being named the  2023  Teachers  of  the
  Year by New York Agriculture in the Classroom
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge the
significant  accomplishments  in  the  distinguished  careers  of  those
outstanding educational leaders, whose dedication and achievements  have
been instrumental in developing character and academic excellence in the
young people of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York State's commitment to education is unparalleled;
its history and stature are secured by the superlative  caliber  of  its
educational professionals and the students they inspire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend Megan and
Clayton Kappauf upon the occasion of being named the  2023  Teachers  of
the Year by New York Agriculture in the Classroom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, New York Agriculture in the Classroom recognizes
an  exceptional  teacher, or teachers, who embody a passion for teaching
through a lens of agriculture in their curriculum; and
 
  WHEREAS, Megan and Clayton Kappauf will  be  representing  New  York
Agriculture  in  the  Classroom  as  model  educators  who  incorporate
agriculture as a context for  learning  in  their  pre-kindergarten  and
STEAM classrooms in Oxford, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Educators  at  Oxford  Primary  School,  the Kappaufs have
created a unique  classroom  environment  where  students  are  actively
engaged  in authentic and hands-on learning through integrating food and
agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a steadfast and unwavering commitment  to  captivating
their  students,  Megan  and  Clayton Kappauf have three aeroponic tower
gardens which serve as a tool for a  real-world  approach  to  reinforce
core  academic  content  in  math, science, English, social studies, and
art; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the school year, Clayton's third grade students help
Megan's kindergarten  students  germinate  the  seeds  for  their  tower
garden,  and  the  third  grade  students monitor and maintain the tower
gardens; by late fall the tower gardens begin to produce crops ready for
harvest, including a bounty of basil; and
 
  WHEREAS, Using the students' curiosity about basil  as  a  teachable
moment,  the  class  learned how to make their own mozzarella cheese and
were able to make a student-made snack of caprese salad; and
 
  WHEREAS, The tower gardens were a gateway to  several  collaborative
and  cross-curricular  projects;  as plants began to flower the need for
pollination arose; students learned about the role the bees and  insects
play  in  pollination  and then learned how to pollinate their plants on
the tower garden; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  motivated  by  the ability to grow their own
food, under the able leadership of Megan and Clayton  Kappauf,  students
designed and built their own greenhouse; they also grew flowers to cheer
up  their campus, as well as peas and lettuce that could be eaten during
the summer reading and math program; and
 
  WHEREAS, The future success of our State  and  Nation  is  dependent
upon  individuals  such as Megan and Clayton Kappauf, who dedicate their
lives as educators, nurturing our most precious resource, our youth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Educators  like  Megan  and  Clayton  Kappauf  provide  a
tremendous  service  to  the  future  of our State and Nation, inspiring
generations of young people in their educational journeys  and  ensuring
their success in their future years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Significant  contributors  to education in New York State,
Megan and Clayton Kappauf clearly have an enduring impact on  the  youth
of  Oxford  Primary  School,  as  well as on the community-at-large, and
accordingly  merit  recognition  and  applause  for  their  impressive
dedication to others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  their  careers  thus  far,  Megan  and Clayton
Kappauf have brought an uncompromising standard of excellence  to  their
work  and  a warm sense of caring and concern to every young person they
educate; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the practice of this Legislative Body to commend  the
efforts  of those individuals who work to support our proud tradition of
public education by providing their skills and talents to  our  schools;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Megan and Clayton Kappauf upon the occasion of being  named  the
2023  Teachers of the Year by New York Agriculture in the Classroom, and
to wish them continued success in all their future endeavors; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Megan and Clayton Kappauf.
