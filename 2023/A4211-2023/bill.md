  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The penal law is amended by adding a new section 205.40  to
 read as follows:
 § 205.40 FAILURE TO RETREAT.
  A  PERSON  IS  GUILTY  OF  FAILURE TO RETREAT WHEN HE OR SHE IS WITHIN
 TWENTY-FIVE FEET OF A POLICE OFFICER OR PEACE  OFFICER  ENGAGED  IN  THE
 PERFORMANCE OF HIS OR HER DUTIES AND THE POLICE OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER
 ORDERS  SUCH  PERSON  TO  HALT  OR RETREAT AND THE PERSON FAILS TO DO SO
 IMMEDIATELY.
  AN INDIVIDUAL SHALL NOT BE GUILTY OF THIS OFFENSE IF  SUCH  INDIVIDUAL
 (A) SUFFERS FROM A PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR PHYSICAL INJURY AND HALTING OR
 RETREATING WOULD EXACERBATE SUCH DISABILITY OR INJURY, OR (B) A PHYSICAL
 BARRIER  MAKES  IT  PHYSICALLY  IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO HALT OR
 RETREAT.
  UNDER THIS SECTION, POLICE OFFICER AND PEACE OFFICER  ARE  AS  DEFINED
 UNDER SECTION 1.20 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW.
  FAILURE TO RETREAT IS A CLASS D FELONY.
  §  2. Paragraphs (t) and (u) of subdivision 4 of section 510.10 of the
 criminal procedure law, paragraph (t) as amended and  paragraph  (u)  as
 added  by section 2 of subpart B of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of

  (t) any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to  an  identifi-
 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a

 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, or any charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  firearm  as
 defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, provided, however, that
 the prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the  defendant
 committed  the  instant crime and any underlying crime. For the purposes
 of this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a  quali-
 fying  offense  as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes of this
 paragraph, "harm to an identifiable person or  property"  shall  include
 but  not  be  limited  to theft of or damage to property. However, based
 upon a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if  the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in  furtherance  of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal shall be
 released on his or her own recognizance or under  appropriate  non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
  (u)  criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined in
 subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale of

 agraph (xxii) is added to read as follows:
  (xx)  any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifi-
 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b  of the penal law where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause  to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and any
 underlying crime. For the purposes of  this  subparagraph,  any  of  the
 underlying  crimes  need  not be a qualifying offense as defined in this
 subdivision. For the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to  an  identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
 damage to property. However, based upon a review of the facts alleged in
 the  accusatory  instrument,  if the court determines that such theft is
 negligible and does not appear to be in furtherance  of  other  criminal
 activity, the principal shall be released on his or her own recognizance
 or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi)  criminal  possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined
 in subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale

 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, where such
