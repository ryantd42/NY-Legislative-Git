  Section  1.  Subdivision  4-b  of  section 400.00 of the penal law, as

 this  section  within  six  months of the date of presentment of such an
 application to the appropriate authority. Such delay  may  only  be  for
 good cause and with respect to the applicant. In acting upon an applica-

 cation and issue the license applied for.
