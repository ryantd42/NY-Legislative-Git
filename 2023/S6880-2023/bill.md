 tenure  based  upon  performance, notwithstanding that his or her annual
 professional performance review had not been completed and he or she had
 not received an annual professional performance rating for the two thou-
 sand nineteen--two thousand twenty, two  thousand  twenty--two  thousand
 twenty-one  or  the  two  thousand  twenty-one--two  thousand twenty-two

 discretion,  qualified for appointment on tenure based upon performance,
 notwithstanding that his or her annual professional  performance  review
 had  not been completed and he or she had not received an annual profes-
 sional performance review rating  for  the  two  thousand  nineteen--two

 teacher or principal shall not be eligible for tenure but the  board  of
 education in its discretion, may extend the teacher's probationary peri-
 od  for  an  additional year; provided, however, that if such teacher or
 principal successfully appealed such ineffective rating, such teacher or
 principal shall immediately be eligible for tenure if the rating result-

 S. 6880  4

 education  may  then  appoint on tenure any or all of the persons recom-
 mended by the superintendent of schools. At the expiration of the proba-
 tionary period, the classroom teacher or building principal shall remain
 in  probationary  status  until the end of the school year in which such
 teacher or principal has received such ratings of  effective  or  highly
 effective  for  at least three of the four preceding school years exclu-
 sive of any breaks in service and subject to the  terms  hereof,  during
 which  time  a board of education shall consider whether to grant tenure
 for those classroom teachers or building principals who  otherwise  have
 been  found  competent,  efficient  and satisfactory. Provided, however,
 that the board of education may grant tenure contingent upon a classroom
 teacher's or building principal's receipt of a  minimum  rating  in  the
 final  year  of the probationary period, pursuant to the requirements of
 this section, and if such contingency is not met after all appeals  have
 been  exhausted, the grant of tenure shall be void and unenforceable and
 the teacher's or principal's probationary  period  may  be  extended  in
 accordance with this subdivision. Such persons who have been recommended
 for  tenure  and  all  others  employed  in  the teaching service of the
 schools of such school district who have served  the  full  probationary
 period as extended pursuant to this subdivision shall hold their respec-
 tive positions during good behavior and efficient and competent service,
 and  shall not be removable except for cause after a hearing as provided
 by section three thousand twenty-a or section three thousand twenty-b of
 this chapter]. Failure to maintain certification  as  required  by  this
 chapter  and  the regulations of the commissioner shall constitute cause
 for removal.

 session teacher of swimming in day schools who has served in that capac-
 ity  for  a period of two years and has been appointed to teach the same
 subject in day schools on an  annual  salary,  the  probationary  period
 shall  be  limited to one year; provided, however, that in the case of a
 teacher who has been appointed on  tenure  in  another  school  district
 within  the  state,  the  school district where currently employed, or a
 board of cooperative educational services, and  who  was  not  dismissed
 from  such  district or board as a result of charges brought pursuant to
 subdivision one of section three thousand  twenty-a  [or  section  three
 thousand  twenty-b]  of  this chapter, the probationary period shall not
 exceed two years; provided, however, that in cities with a population of

 not received an annual professional performance rating for the two thou-
 sand  twenty--two  thousand  twenty-one  or two thousand twenty-one--two
 thousand twenty-two school year; provided further that,  notwithstanding
 any  other  provision  of  this  section to the contrary, when a teacher
 receives an effective and/or highly effective rating in each year of his
 or her probationary service except he or  she  receives  an  ineffective
 rating in the final year of his or her probationary period, such teacher
 or principal shall not be eligible for tenure but the board of education
 in  its  discretion, may extend the teacher's probationary period for an
 additional year; provided, however, that if such  teacher  or  principal
 successfully appealed such ineffective rating, such teacher or principal
 shall  immediately  be  eligible for tenure if the rating resulting from
 the appeal established that such individual has been effective or highly
 effective in at least three of the preceding  four  years  and  was  not
 ineffective  in  the  final  year. At the expiration of the probationary
 period, the classroom teacher or  building  principal  shall  remain  in
 probationary  status  until  the  end  of  the school year in which such
 teacher or principal has received such ratings of  effective  or  highly
 effective  for at least three of the four preceding school years, exclu-
 sive of any breaks in service and subject to the  terms  hereof,  during
 which  time  a board of education shall consider whether to grant tenure
 for those classroom teachers or building principals who  otherwise  have
 been  found  competent,  efficient  and satisfactory. Provided, however,
 that the board of education may grant tenure contingent upon a classroom
 teacher's or building principal's receipt of a  minimum  rating  in  the
 S. 6880  10

 final  year  of the probationary period, pursuant to the requirements of
 this section, and if such contingency is not met after all appeals  have
 been  exhausted, the grant of tenure shall be void and unenforceable and
 the  teacher's  or  principal's  probationary  period may be extended in
 accordance with this subdivision]. Such persons  who  have  been  recom-
 mended for tenure and all others employed in the teaching service of the
 schools  of  such  school district who have served the full probationary
 period as extended pursuant to this subdivision shall hold their respec-
 tive positions during good behavior and efficient and competent service,
 and shall not be removable except for cause after a hearing as  provided
 by  section three thousand twenty-a [or section three thousand twenty-b]
 of this chapter. Failure to maintain certification as required  by  this
 chapter  and  the regulations of the commissioner shall constitute cause
 for removal.

 provided,  however, that in the case of a teacher who has been appointed
 on tenure in another  school  district  within  the  state,  the  school
 district where currently employed, or a board of cooperative educational
 services,  and  who  was  not dismissed from such district or board as a

 section three thousand twelve-d of this  article  in  the  two  thousand
 seventeen--two  thousand eighteen or two thousand eighteen--two thousand
 nineteen school year in such other school district, board of cooperative

 superintendent of schools, by a majority vote of the board of  education
 or the trustees of a common school district.

 any  school year for which there is no required service and/or for which
 no compensation is provided shall in any event  constitute  a  break  or
 suspension  of probationary period or continuity of tenure rights of any

 section  three thousand twenty-b] of this article, the principal, admin-
 istrator, supervisor, or other member of the supervising staff shall  be
 appointed  for  a probationary period of three years. [Provided further,
 however, that in the case of a classroom teacher who has been  appointed
 for  a  probationary period during the two thousand twenty--two thousand
 twenty-one, the two thousand twenty-one--two thousand twenty-two or  the
 two  thousand  twenty-two--two thousand twenty-three school year and who
 has been appointed on tenure in a  school  district  within  the  state,
 state school for the blind or deaf, the board of cooperative educational
 services  where  currently  employed,  or  another  board of cooperative
 educational services, and who was  not  dismissed  from  such  district,
 board  or  state  school  for  the  blind or deaf as a result of charges

 annual  professional performance review rating pursuant to section three
 thousand twelve-c or section three thousand twelve-d of this article  of
 either  effective or highly effective in the two thousand seventeen--two
 thousand eighteen or two thousand eighteen--two thousand nineteen school
 year in such other school district, state school for the blind  or  deaf
 or  board  of cooperative educational services.] Services of a person so
 appointed to any such positions to which this paragraph applies  may  be
 discontinued at any time during the probationary period, upon the recom-
 mendation  of  the  district  superintendent,  by a majority vote of the
 board of cooperative educational services.
  2. (a) On or before the expiration  of  the  probationary  term  of  a
 person  appointed  for  such  term  prior  to  July  first, two thousand
 fifteen, the district superintendent of schools  shall  make  a  written
 report to the board of cooperative educational services recommending for
 appointment  on  tenure persons who have been found competent, efficient
 and satisfactory. Such persons shall  hold  their  respective  positions
 during  good  behavior and competent and efficient service and shall not
 be removed except for any of the following causes, after a  hearing,  as
 provided  by  section three thousand twenty-a [or section three thousand
 twenty-b] of this article: (i)  Insubordination,  immoral  character  or
 conduct  unbecoming  a  teacher;  (ii)  Inefficiency,  incompetency,  or
 neglect of duty; (iii) Failure to maintain certification as required  by
 this chapter and by the regulations of the commissioner. Each person who
 is  not to be so recommended for appointment on tenure shall be so noti-
 fied in writing by the district superintendent not later than sixty days
 immediately preceding the expiration of his or her probationary period.
  (b) On or before the expiration of the probationary term of  a  person
 appointed  for  such  term on or after July first, two thousand fifteen,
 the district superintendent of schools shall make a  written  report  to
 the  board of cooperative educational services recommending for appoint-
 ment on tenure persons who have  been  found  competent,  efficient  and
 satisfactory  [and, in the case of a classroom teacher or building prin-
 cipal, who  have  received  composite  annual  professional  performance
 review  ratings  pursuant  to section three thousand twelve-c or section
 three thousand twelve-d of this article, of either effective  or  highly
 effective  in  at  least three of the four preceding years, exclusive of
 any breaks in service; provided that, in the case of a classroom teacher
 or building principal appointed during the two  thousand  seventeen--two
 thousand eighteen or two thousand twenty--two thousand twenty-one school
 year  who have received composite annual professional performance review
 ratings pursuant to section three thousand  twelve-c  or  section  three
 thousand  twelve-d  of this article of either effective or highly effec-
 tive in at least one of the  four  preceding  years,  exclusive  of  any
 breaks  in  service,  and  did  not receive an ineffective rating in the
 final year of his or her probationary  period  or  in  the  most  recent
 school  year  where  a  rating  was received, and would have been in the
 district superintendent of schools' discretion qualified for appointment
 on tenure based upon performance, notwithstanding that his or her annual
 professional performance review had not been completed and he or she had
 not received an annual professional performance rating for the two thou-
 sand nineteen--two thousand twenty, two  thousand  twenty--two  thousand
 twenty-one  or  the  two  thousand  twenty-one--two  thousand twenty-two
 school year; provided that, in the case of a classroom teacher or build-
 ing principal appointed during the two thousand  eighteen--two  thousand
 nineteen  or two thousand nineteen--two thousand twenty school year, who
 S. 6880  19

 has  not  received  composite  annual  professional  performance  review
 ratings  pursuant  to  section  three thousand twelve-c or section three
 thousand twelve-d of  this  article  for  three  consecutive  years,  no
 ratings  shall be required for the district superintendent of schools to
 recommend for appointment on tenure such teacher or  building  principal
 if the teacher or principal would have been, in the district superinten-
 dent  of  schools' discretion, qualified for appointment on tenure based
 upon performance, notwithstanding that his or  her  annual  professional
 performance review had not been completed and he or she had not received
 an  annual  professional  performance review rating for the two thousand
 nineteen--two thousand twenty, two thousand twenty--two  thousand  twen-
 ty-one  and  two  thousand  twenty-one--two  thousand  twenty-two school
 years; provided that in the case of  a  classroom  teacher  or  building
 principal  appointed  during  the  two thousand twenty-one--two thousand
 twenty-two school year who have received composite  annual  professional
 performance  review  ratings pursuant to section three thousand twelve-c
 or section three thousand twelve-d of this article of  either  effective
 or  highly effective in at least two of the four preceding years, exclu-
 sive of any breaks in service, and did not receive an ineffective rating
 in the final year of his or her probationary period, or during the  most
 recent  school  year where a rating was received, and would have been in
 the  district  superintendent  of  schools'  discretion  qualified  for
 appointment  on  tenure based upon performance, notwithstanding that his
 or her annual professional performance review had not been completed and
 he or she had not received an annual professional performance rating for
 the two thousand twenty--two thousand twenty-one or two  thousand  twen-
 ty-one--two  thousand  twenty-two  school  year;  provided further that,
 notwithstanding any other provision of this  section  to  the  contrary,
 when  a  teacher  or principal receives an effective or highly effective
 rating in each year of his or her probationary service except he or  she
 receives  an  ineffective  rating in the final year of his or her proba-
 tionary period, such teacher shall not be eligible for  tenure  but  the
 board  of  education  in its discretion, may extend the teacher's proba-
 tionary period for an additional year; provided, however  that  if  such
 teacher or principal successfully appealed such ineffective rating, such
 teacher  or  principal  shall  immediately be eligible for tenure if the
 rating resulting from the appeal established that  such  individual  has
 been  effective  or  highly effective in at least three of the preceding
 four years and was not ineffective in the final year. At the  expiration
 of  the probationary period, the classroom teacher or building principal
 shall remain in probationary status until the end of the school year  in
 which  such  teacher or principal has received such ratings of effective
 or highly effective for at least three  of  the  four  preceding  school
 years,  exclusive of any breaks in service, during which time a board of
 cooperative educational services shall consider whether to grant  tenure
 for  those  classroom teachers or building principals who otherwise have
 been found competent, efficient  and  satisfactory.  Provided,  however,
 that  the  board  of  cooperative  educational services may grant tenure
 contingent upon a classroom teacher's or building principal's receipt of
 a minimum rating in the final year of the probationary period,  pursuant
 to  the requirements of this section, and if such contingency is not met
 after all appeals have been exhausted, the grant of tenure shall be void
 and unenforceable and the teacher's or principal's  probationary  period
 may be extended in accordance with this subdivision]. Such persons shall
 hold  their  respective positions during good behavior and competent and
 efficient service and shall not be removed except for any of the follow-
 S. 6880  20
 
 ing causes, after a hearing, as provided by section three thousand twen-
 ty-a [or section three thousand twenty-b] of this article: (i)  Insubor-
 dination,  immoral  character  or  conduct  unbecoming  a  teacher; (ii)
 Inefficiency,  incompetency,  or neglect of duty; (iii) Failure to main-
 tain certification as required by this chapter and by the regulations of
 the commissioner. Each person who  is  not  to  be  so  recommended  for
 appointment  on  tenure  shall be so notified in writing by the district
 superintendent not later than sixty days immediately preceding the expi-
 ration of his or her probationary period.

 the laws of 1994, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 103 of the laws of
 2010,  subdivision  3  and  paragraph  a  of subdivision 4 as amended by

 subdivision 4 as added by section 1 of part J of chapter 93 of the  laws

  § 3020. Discipline of  teachers. 1. No person enjoying the benefits of
 tenure shall be disciplined or  removed  during  a  term  of  employment
 except for just cause and in accordance with the procedures specified in
 section  three  thousand  twenty-a of this article or in accordance with
 alternate disciplinary procedures contained in a  collective  bargaining
 agreement  covering  his  or her terms and conditions of employment that
 was effective on or before September first, nineteen hundred ninety-four
 and has been unaltered by renegotiation, or in accordance with  alterna-
 tive disciplinary procedures contained in a collective bargaining agree-
 ment covering his or her terms and conditions of employment that becomes
 effective  on  or  after  September first, nineteen hundred ninety-four;
 provided, however,  that  any  such  alternate  disciplinary  procedures
 contained in a collective bargaining agreement that becomes effective on
 or after September first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, must provide for
 the  written election by the employee of either the procedures specified
 in such section [three thousand twenty-a] or the  alternative  discipli-
 nary  procedures  contained  in  the collective bargaining agreement and
 must result in a disposition  of  the  disciplinary  charge  within  the
 amount of time allowed therefor under such section [three thousand twen-
 ty-a;  and  provided  further that any alternate disciplinary procedures
 contained in a collective bargaining agreement that becomes effective on
 or after July first, two thousand ten shall  provide  for  an  expedited
 hearing  process  before  a  single  hearing  officer in accordance with
 subparagraph (i-a) of paragraph c of subdivision three of section  three
 thousand  twenty-a of this article in cases in which charges of incompe-
 tence are brought based solely upon an allegation of a pattern of  inef-
 fective  teaching  or  performance  as defined in section three thousand
 twelve-c of this article and shall provide that such a pattern of  inef-
 fective  teaching  or  performance  shall  constitute  very  significant
 evidence of incompetence  which  may  form  the  basis  for  just  cause
 removal].
  2.  No person enjoying the benefits of tenure shall be suspended for a
 fixed time without pay or dismissed due to a violation of article  thir-
 teen-E of the public health law.
  3.  Notwithstanding  any inconsistent provision of law, the procedures
 set forth in section three thousand twenty-a of this article and  subdi-
 vision seven of section twenty-five hundred ninety-j of this chapter may
 be modified or replaced by agreements negotiated between the city school
 district  of  the city of New York and any employee organization repres-
 enting employees or titles that are or were covered by any memorandum of
 agreement executed by such city  school  district  and  the  council  of
 S. 6880  21
 
 supervisors  and  administrators  of  the  city  of New York on or after
 December first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Where such procedures  are
 so  modified  or  replaced:  (i)  compliance  with  such modification or
 replacement  procedures shall satisfy any provision in this chapter that
 requires  compliance  with  section  three  thousand  twenty-a  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  (ii)  any  employee  against  whom charges have been preferred
 prior to the effective date of such modification  or  replacement  shall
 continue to be subject to the provisions of such section as in effect on
 the  date  such charges were preferred, (iii) the provisions of subdivi-
 sions one and two of this section shall not apply to agreements  negoti-
 ated pursuant to this subdivision, and (iv) in accordance with paragraph
 (e)  of  subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred nine-a of the civil
 service law, such modification or replacement procedures contained in an
 agreement negotiated pursuant to  this  subdivision  shall  continue  as
 terms  of  such  agreement after its expiration until a new agreement is
 negotiated[;  provided  that  any  alternate  disciplinary  procedures
 contained in a collective bargaining agreement that becomes effective on
 or  after  July  first,  two thousand ten shall provide for an expedited
 hearing process before a  single  hearing  officer  in  accordance  with
 subparagraph  (i-a) of paragraph c of subdivision three of section three
 thousand twenty-a of this article in cases in which charges of  incompe-
 tence  are  brought  against  a  building principal based solely upon an
 allegation of a  pattern  of  ineffective  teaching  or  performance  as
 defined  in  section  three  thousand twelve-c of this article and shall
 provide that such a pattern of ineffective teaching or performance shall
 constitute very significant evidence of incompetence which may form  the
 basis  for  just  cause  removal  of the building principal and provided
 further that  any  alternate  disciplinary  procedures  contained  in  a
 collective  bargaining agreement that becomes effective on or after July
 first, two thousand fifteen shall provide that all hearings pursuant  to
 sections  three  thousand  twenty-a  or  three thousand twenty-b of this
 article shall be conducted before a single hearing officer and that  two
 consecutive ineffective ratings pursuant to annual professional perform-
 ance  reviews  conducted  in  accordance  with the provisions of section
 three thousand twelve-c or three thousand twelve-d of this article shall
 constitute prima facie evidence of incompetence that can only  be  over-
 come  by clear and convincing evidence that the employee is not incompe-
 tent in light of all surrounding circumstances, and if not  successfully
 overcome, the finding, absent extraordinary circumstances, shall be just
 cause for removal, and that three consecutive ineffective ratings pursu-
 ant  to  annual professional performance reviews conducted in accordance
 with the provisions of section three thousand twelve-c or three thousand
 twelve-d of this article shall constitute prima facie evidence of incom-
 petence that can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence  that
 the  calculation of one or more of the principal's underlying components
 on the annual professional performance reviews pursuant to section three
 thousand twelve-c or three thousand twelve-d of this article was fraudu-
 lent, and if not successfully overcome,  the  finding,  absent  extraor-
 dinary  circumstances,  shall be just cause for removal. For purposes of
 this subdivision, fraud shall include mistaken identity].  Notwithstand-
 ing any inconsistent provision of law, the commissioner shall review any
 appeals authorized by such modification or replacement procedures within
 fifteen  days  from  receipt by such commissioner of the record of prior
 proceedings in the matter subject to  appeal.  Such  review  shall  have
 preference  over  all  other  appeals or proceedings pending before such
 commissioner.

 ter  may  be  modified  by agreements negotiated between the city school
 district  of  the city of New York and any employee organization repres-
 enting employees or titles that are or were covered by any memorandum of
 agreement executed by such city school district and  the  united  feder-
 ation  of teachers on or after June tenth, two thousand two.  Where such
 procedures are so modified: (i) compliance with such modified procedures
 shall satisfy any provision of this  chapter  that  requires  compliance
 with  section three thousand twenty-a of this article; (ii) any employee
 against whom charges have been preferred prior to the effective date  of
 such modification shall continue to be subject to the provisions of such
 section  as in effect on the date such charges were preferred; (iii) the
 provisions of subdivisions one and two of this section shall  not  apply
 to  agreements  negotiated  pursuant to this subdivision, except that no
 person enjoying the benefits of tenure shall be disciplined  or  removed
 during  a  term of employment except for just cause; and (iv) in accord-
 ance with paragraph (e) of subdivision one of section two hundred nine-a
 of the civil service law,  such  modified  procedures  contained  in  an
 agreement  negotiated  pursuant  to  this  subdivision shall continue as
 terms of such agreement after its expiration until a  new  agreement  is
 negotiated[; and provided further that any alternate disciplinary proce-
 dures contained in a collective bargaining agreement that becomes effec-
 tive on or after July first, two thousand ten shall provide for an expe-
 dited hearing process before a single hearing officer in accordance with
 subparagraph  (i-a) of paragraph c of subdivision three of section three
 thousand twenty-a of this article in cases in which charges of  incompe-
 tence  are brought based solely upon an allegation of a pattern of inef-
 fective teaching or performance as defined  in  section  three  thousand
 twelve-c  of this article and shall provide that such a pattern of inef-
 fective  teaching  or  performance  shall  constitute  very  significant
 evidence  of  incompetence  which  may  form  the  basis  for just cause
 removal, and provided further that any alternate disciplinary procedures
 contained in a collective bargaining agreement that becomes effective on
 or after July first, two thousand fifteen shall provide that  all  hear-
 ings  pursuant  to  sections  three  thousand twenty-a or three thousand
 twenty-b of this article shall be  conducted  before  a  single  hearing
 officer  and that two consecutive ineffective ratings pursuant to annual
 professional  performance  reviews  conducted  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions of section three thousand twelve-c or three thousand twelve-d
 of  this  article  shall constitute prima facie evidence of incompetence
 that can only be overcome by clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the
 employee  is  not incompetent in light of all surrounding circumstances,
 and if not successfully  overcome,  the  finding,  absent  extraordinary
 circumstances,  shall  be just cause for removal, and that three consec-
 utive ineffective ratings pursuant to  annual  professional  performance
 reviews  conducted  in  accordance  with the provisions of section three
 thousand twelve-c or three  thousand  twelve-d  of  this  article  shall
 constitute  prima  facie evidence of incompetence that can only be over-
 come by clear and convincing evidence that the  calculation  of  one  or
 more  of  the teacher's underlying components on the annual professional
 performance reviews pursuant to section three thousand twelve-c or three
 thousand twelve-d of this article was fraudulent, and if not successful-
 ly overcome, the finding, absent extraordinary circumstances,  shall  be
 S. 6880  23

 just  cause  for  removal.  For  purposes of this paragraph, fraud shall
 include mistaken identity].
  b.  Any  modifications  to  the  procedures set forth in section three
 thousand twenty-a of this article and subdivision seven of section twen-
 ty-five hundred ninety-j of this chapter shall not change the manner  in
 which  the  fees and expenses of such proceedings pursuant to the afore-
 said sections are paid.
