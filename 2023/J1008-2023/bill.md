  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern, and fully in accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 25, 2023, as Africa
Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with  International  Africa
Day on May 25, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Celebrated annually, Africa Day is the commemoration of the
creation  of  the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.), formerly known
as African Freedom Day and African Liberation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's theme for Africa Day is  "Year  of  Nutrition";
and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 25, 1963, the leaders of 30 of Africa's 32 sovereign
republics  signed  a  founding  charter  to establish the O.A.U.; it was
established  to  assist  numerous  African  countries  in  achieving
transformation, freedom, and independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, The African Economic Community was founded by the O.A.U. in
1991, and the African Union was established by the O.A.U. in 2002; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the  second  largest  continent in the world, Africans
speak roughly 2,000 different languages with  their  own  dialects;  May
25th  is  a day for Africans and those who love Africa to show the world
that the continent is great and thriving; and
 
  WHEREAS, The strength and resilience of  the  African  continent  is
proudly  celebrated  by  this  Legislative  Body, and this pride will be
found in even more places around the world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 25, 2023, as Africa
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
