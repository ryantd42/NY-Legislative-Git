  Community Church
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social, and
educational benefits they confer, play a vital role in  the  development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the tradition of this State and Nation to pay tribute
to  those  institutions  and  individuals  who  have  contributed to the
ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body takes pleasure in  commemorating  the
50th  Anniversary  of  the  Evangel Community Church of Chittenango, New
York, to be celebrated on Saturday, April  22,  2023,  with  a  memorial
banquet  in  Canastota,  New York, and a special worship service the day
following; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Sunday service that will  honor  the  anniversary  will
include  special  music and former pastors telling stories of their days
at Evangel Community Church; there will also be performances  of  period
songs from the 1970s through the 2020s, with former pastor Reverend Doug
Moore being the keynote speaker; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following the special Sunday service will be a luncheon at
the Evangel Cafe, where a variety of dishes will be enjoyed  and  shared
over  the  fond  recollection  of  the  auspicious  accomplishments  and
cherished memories which community members share of the Church; and
 
  WHEREAS, Evangel Assembly began as a home Bible study in  1972,  and

around Chittenango, the Church broke ground on its current site  on  May
11, 1975, Mother's Day that year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the 1980s, the Evangel Church had a congregation

Missionettes for girls, as  well  as  a  number  of  adult  Bible  study
programs; the Church's hard work continues today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Evangel  Community  Church stands on the threshold of
tomorrow, prepared to meet the challenges of the  coming  decades  while
retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  walls  of  the  Church  have never been exclusionary,
always inviting in and standing  up  for  marginalized  communities  and
those experiencing hardships; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the custom of this Legislative Body to take note of
enduring religious institutions and to bring such  institutions  to  the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Evangel Community Church, to  be
 
celebrated  on  Saturday,  April  22,  2023,  fully  confident that this
commemoration reflects the belief in  those  values  which  enhance  the
dignity and purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Evangel Community Church.
