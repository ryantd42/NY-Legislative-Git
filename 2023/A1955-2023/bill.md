 man will comply with the state office for the aging's determination that
 such designation should not be made.
  (b)  The  designated entity shall be an area agency on aging, a public

 THIS SECTION. In addition, upon designation, the entity  is  responsible
 for  providing  for  adequate  and  qualified  staff,  which may include
 trained volunteers to perform the functions of the local long-term  care
 ombudsman program.
  (2)  No  local  program staff OR DISTRICT COUNCIL STAFF, including the
 supervisor and any volunteers, shall perform or carry out the activities
 on behalf of the state long-term care ombudsman program OR THE  DISTRICT
 LONG-TERM  OMBUDSMAN COUNCIL PROGRAM unless such staff has been verified

 or remove the designation; provided, however, if the  state  office  for
 the  aging is aware or becomes aware of evidence that the designation or

 program would result in legal concerns or liability for the state office
 for the aging or the office of the state long-term care  ombudsman,  the
 state ombudsman will comply with the state office for the aging's deter-
 mination  that  such  designation should not be made or that such desig-
 nation be refused, suspended, or removed.
  (e) The state ombudsman shall develop a grievance process to offer  an
 opportunity  for  reconsideration of any decision to refuse, suspend, or
 remove the designation of a local ombudsman entity. Notwithstanding  the
 grievance  process,  the  state  ombudsman shall make the final determi-
 nation to designate or to refuse, suspend, or remove the designation  of
 a local ombudsman entity; provided, however, if the state office for the
 aging  is aware or becomes aware of any evidence that the designation of
 an entity to operate a long-term care ombudsman  program  by  the  state
 long-term  care  ombudsman or that the failure of the state ombudsman to
 refuse, suspend, or remove the designation of a local  ombudsman  entity
 would result in legal concerns or liability for the state office for the
 aging  or  the  office  of the state long-term care ombudsman, the state
 ombudsman will comply with the state office  for  the  aging's  determi-
 nation that such designation should not be made or that such designation
 be refused, suspended, or removed.
