  CONGRATULATING  the Avoca-Prattsburgh Varsity Boys
  Basketball Team upon the occasion of  capturing  the
  NYSPHSAA  Boys  Basketball  Class  D Championship on
  March 19, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, Individual and team championships are highly  sought  after
in  high  school  sports;  this  Legislative Body commends rare athletic
achievements and pays special  recognition  to  those  who  pursue  such
excellence and become examples for the youth of this great Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Athletic  competition  helps to enhance both the moral and
physical development of young athletes, preparing them for the future by
instilling in them the importance of teamwork, encouraging a standard of
healthy living, and developing a sense of fair play and competition; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to  congratulate  the
Avoca-Prattsburgh  Varsity  Boys  Basketball  Team  upon the occasion of
capturing the NYSPHSAA Boys Basketball Class D Championship, which  will
be  celebrated  at  an  Athletic  Awards Ceremony on Wednesday, June 14,
2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, To the praise and  applause  of  their  excited  fans,  the
Titans defeated Chapel Field Christian Central High School in a decisive
70-48 victory to win back-to-back championships and their fourth between
the  two school's program history on Sunday, March 19, 2023, at the Cool
Insuring Arena in Glens Falls, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Proudly donning the school's colors of black and old  gold,
family, friends, and the community at large loyally and enthusiastically
supported the Titans throughout their journey as they ended their season
with an impressive overall 25-2 record; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the merger of Avoca and Prattsburgh's boys basketball
teams in 2020, the Titans are 62-2 with three straight Section V Class D
titles;  in  1999, Avoca High School beat Prattsburgh High School in the
Section V Class D state  qualifier,  which  was  Avoca's  first  section
championship  in  20  years,  and  Prattsburgh's  D2 crown was its third
section title since 2015; and
 
  WHEREAS, In a sport  such  as  basketball,  which  demands  athletic
prowess,  speed  and  agility,  Head  Coach  Brian  Putnam and Assistant
Coaches Zac DeVoe, Steve Hopkins, and Andy Ratchford have worked hard to
hone the skills of this championship team,  teaching  these  outstanding
athletes  lessons which will prove invaluable both on and off the court;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Head Coach Brian Putnam and all of the outstanding athletes
on the Avoca-Prattsburgh  Varsity  Boys  Basketball  Team  have  clearly
utilized  dedication,  determination and teamwork in providing a lasting
contribution to the spirit of excellence which is a tradition  of  their
school; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate the members of the Avoca-Prattsburgh  High  School  Varsity
