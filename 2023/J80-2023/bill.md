  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2023, as  Thyroid  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body hereby memorializes Governor Kathy
Hochul to proclaim January 2023, as Thyroid Awareness Month in the State
of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The thyroid is a  small  gland  responsible  for  producing
hormones  that  play a crucial role in many of the body's systems - from
cells and tissues, to organs like the heart, brain, liver, and  kidneys;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dysfunction  occurs  when  the thyroid produces either too
much  or  too  little  thyroid  hormone;  either  can  disrupt  healthy
functioning of vital organs, leading to a large range of symptoms; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thyroid  Disease  is  any  dysfunction  of the thyroid and
encompasses  a  wide  array  of  disorders,  such  as  thyroid  nodules,
hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  Goiter,  Graves' disease, Hashimoto's
thyroiditis, and various thyroid cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that more than 30  million  Americans  have
thyroid  dysfunction,  yet  at least half of these cases are undiagnosed
and, consequently, untreated;  women  are  five  times  more  likely  to
develop thyroid problems than men; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in  1923,  the American Thyroid Association is an
international organization with over 1,600  members  from  43  countries
which  is  dedicated  to  the  advancement,  understanding,  prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of thyroid disorders and thyroid cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through public awareness, this Legislative  Body  seeks  to
minimize  the  devastating  effects  of  Thyroid  Disease  among all the
citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2023, as Thyroid
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
