  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 16, 2023, as Day of the African  Child  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
organizations  which  foster  ethnic  pride  and  enhance the profile of
cultural diversity which strengthens the fabric of  the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 16, 2023, as Day of
the African Child in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of International Day of the African Child; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established on June 16, 1991 by the Organization of African
Unity  (OAU),  Day of the African Child honors those who participated in
the Soweto Uprising  in  1976,  while  also  raising  awareness  of  the
continuing  need  for  improvement  of the education provided to African
children; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital day began as  a  protest  by  thousands,  mostly
students,  against  the  government's  insistence  that  the  Afrikaans
language, a language of the white minority who ruled  South  Africa,  be
used as the medium of instruction in Soweto's high schools, which served
black Africans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  Soweto,  South Africa, on June 16, 1976, approximately
10,000 black school children marched in a column more than half  a  mile
long, protesting the poor quality of their education and demanding their
right to be taught in their own language; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hundreds  of  young  students  were shot and more than 100
people were killed in  these  protests;  in  the  following  two  weeks,
approximately 1,000 were injured; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June 16th every year, governments, NGOs, international
organizations and other stakeholders gather to  discuss  the  challenges
and  opportunities facing the full realization of the rights of children
in Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the practice of this Legislative  Body  to  recognize
those important days which remind us of the rich and diverse heritage of
our great State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 16, 2023, as  Day  of
the  African  Child  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of International Day of the African Child, in  honor  of  the
significant  and  countless  contributions  of  New  Yorkers  of African
descent who have enriched our Nation and our State; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
