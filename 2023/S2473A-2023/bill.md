 § 1509. Disqualification  of  shareholders,  directors,  officers  and

 service  corporation,  including  a  design  professional service corpo-
 ration, who has  been  rendering  professional  service  to  the  public
 becomes  legally  disqualified  to practice his OR HER profession within
 S. 2473  3

 this state, he OR SHE shall sever all  employment  with,  and  financial
 interests  (other  than  interests  as  a creditor) in, such corporation
 forthwith or as otherwise provided in section 1510 of this article.  All
 provisions of law regulating the rendering of professional services by a
 person  elected or appointed to a public office shall be applicable to a
 shareholder, director, officer and employee of such corporation  in  the
 same  manner  and  to the same extent as if fully set forth herein. Such
 legal disqualification to practice his OR  HER  profession  within  this
 state shall be deemed to constitute an irrevocable offer by the disqual-
 ified shareholder to sell his OR HER shares to the corporation, pursuant
 to  the provisions of section 1510 of this article or of the certificate
 of incorporation, by-laws or agreement among  the  corporation  and  all
 shareholders, whichever is applicable. Compliance with the terms of such
 offer  shall  be specifically enforceable in the courts of this state. A
 professional service corporation's failure to  enforce  compliance  with
 this  provision  shall constitute a ground for forfeiture of its certif-
 icate of incorporation and its dissolution.

 amended by chapter 550 of the laws of 2011, is amended and a  new  para-
 graph (c) is added to read as follows:
  (a) No shareholder of a professional service corporation [or], INCLUD-
 ING  a design professional service corporation, may sell or transfer his
 OR HER shares in such corporation except to another  individual  who  is
 eligible  to  have  shares  issued  to him OR HER by such corporation or
 except in trust to another individual who would be eligible  to  receive
 shares  if  he  OR  SHE were employed by the corporation. Nothing herein
 contained shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of shares by oper-
 ation of law or by court decree.  No transferee of shares  by  operation
 of  law  or  court decree may vote the shares for any purpose whatsoever
 except with respect to corporate action under sections 909 and  1001  of
 this chapter. The restriction in the preceding sentence shall not apply,
 however,  where  such transferee would be eligible to have shares issued
 to him OR HER if he OR SHE were an employee of the corporation  and,  if
 there  are  other  shareholders,  a  majority of such other shareholders
 shall fail to redeem the shares so transferred, pursuant to section 1510
 of this article, within sixty days of receiving written notice  of  such
 transfer.  Any  sale  or  transfer,  except by operation of law or court
 decree or except for a corporation having only one shareholder,  may  be
 made only after the same shall have been approved by the board of direc-
 tors, or at a shareholders' meeting specially called for such purpose by
 such  proportion, not less than a majority, of the outstanding shares as
 may be provided in the certificate of incorporation or in the by-laws of
 such professional service corporation. At such shareholders' meeting the
 shares held by the shareholder proposing to sell or transfer his OR  HER
 shares  may  not  be voted or counted for any purpose, unless all share-
 holders consent that such shares be voted or counted. The certificate of
 incorporation or the by-laws of the professional service corporation, or
 the professional service corporation and  the  shareholders  by  private
 agreement,  may  provide,  in  lieu  of  or in addition to the foregoing
 provisions, for the alienation of shares and may require the  redemption
 or purchase of such shares by such corporation at prices and in a manner
 specifically set forth therein. The existence of the restrictions on the
 sale  or transfer of shares, as contained in this article and, if appli-
 cable, in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, stock  purchase  or
 stock  redemption agreement, shall be noted conspicuously on the face or
 back of every certificate for shares issued by  a  professional  service

 corporation.  Any  sale  or  transfer  in violation of such restrictions
 shall be void.
  (C)  A FIRM ESTABLISHED FOR THE BUSINESS PURPOSE OF INCORPORATING AS A
 PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CORPORATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH  (H)  OF  SECTION
 FIFTEEN  HUNDRED  THREE  OF  THIS  ARTICLE, SHALL PURCHASE OR REDEEM THE
 SHARES OF A NON-LICENSED PROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDER IN THE CASE OF HIS  OR
 HER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER SUCH TERMINATION.
 A  FIRM  ESTABLISHED  FOR  THE  BUSINESS  PURPOSE  OF INCORPORATING AS A
