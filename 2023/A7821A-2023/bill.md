  Section  1.  Section 1000 of the retirement and social security law is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 8-a to read as follows:

 SIXTEEN  AND  WHO  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  ENTITLED TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
 SECTION, MAY MAKE APPLICATION TO SUCH RETIREMENT SYSTEM  NO  LATER  THAN
 DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL MILI-
 TARY  RETIREMENT  ALLOWANCE  PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.  THE SUPPLE-

 SUPPLEMENTAL MILITARY RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE SHALL BE ADDED TO THE RETIRE-
 MENT  ALLOWANCE  OF SUCH PERSON EACH MONTH. THE BENEFIT PAYABLE PURSUANT

 PERSON. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE SHALL
 EXCLUDE ANY ANNUITY DERIVED FROM VOLUNTARY  CONTRIBUTIONS  MADE  BY  THE
 INDIVIDUAL,  EXCEPT  THOSE  MADE PURSUANT TO ELECTIONS UNDER SUBDIVISION

 MENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY LAW.  Said percentage is set forth in  subdivi-
 sion d of this section.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would amend Section 1000 of the Retirement and Social Secu-
 rity Law to allow retirees of the New York State  and  Local  Retirement
 Systems  to  apply  for  a supplemental pension benefit based upon prior
 military service that was not creditable to the member prior to  retire-
 ment.  The member must have retired prior to May 31, 2016. The amount of
 the supplemental benefit is equal to the single life allowance plus  any
 cost-of-living  adjustment,  not to exceed $15,000, multiplied by 3% for
 each year of military service credit granted, not to exceed three years.
 The surviving spouse and lifetime  beneficiary  of  a  deceased  retiree
 shall receive half of what the deceased member would have received.
  An  eligible  retiree  must  file  an application for the supplemental
 pension no later than December 31, 2024, but will  not  be  required  to
 make  any payment to obtain the benefit. The payment of the supplemental
 benefit will begin with the first  monthly  pension  payment  issued  at
 least 30 days after receipt of the application.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $52.9 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be  funded  entirely  by
 billing a past service cost to cover retrospective benefit increases. To
 fund  these  retrospective costs, the State of New York will be required
 to pay $59.0 million (including interest) as of March 1, 2025.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the increase in the present value of benefits would be approximately $25
 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $25 million  $12 million
  Tier 6  $0 million  $13 million
  Total  $25 million  $25 million
 
  In  the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement is funded by increasing the
 billing rates  charged  annually  to  cover  the  retrospective  benefit
 A. 7821--A  4
 
 increases. The annual contribution required of all participating employ-
 ers in NYSLPFRS is 0.1% of billable salary, or approximately $860,000 to
 the  State  of  New  York  and  approximately $3.52 million to the local
 participating  employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subse-
 quent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the
 members in the NYSLPFRS.
  The  exact  number  of  retirees that could be affected by this legis-
 lation cannot be readily determined.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 May 31, 2016.

  The Unfunded Accrued Liability increases were recognized in the  first
 year.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  number  of  members who will receive an additional
 benefit due to this  proposed  legislation  is  unknown.  The  estimates
 presented  herein  are  based on preliminary census data collected as of
 June 30, 2023 and military service purchased under  Chapter  41  of  the
 Laws of 2016. The census data for the potentially impacted population is
 summarized below.
  NYCERS  TRS  BERS  POLICE  FIRE
 Receiving Members
 - Number Count:  98,370  64,179  11,736  41,101  12,498
 - Average Age:  76.0  78.0  79.0  66.0  71.0
 
  A  NYCRS retiree would be eligible to receive the Supplemental Retire-
 ment Allowance (Eligible Recipient) if he or she:
  o Retired prior to May 31, 2016 and was therefore ineligible for Chap-
 ter 41 of the Laws of 2016 due to its May 31, 2016 effective date,
  o Would have otherwise met the current eligibility criteria of Retire-
 ment and Social Security Law Section 1000, and
  o Files an application for such benefit by December 31, 2024.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: The annual Supplemental  Retirement  Allow-
 ance  would  be  equal  to  0.25%  for each month of qualifying military
 service (not to exceed 36 months) multiplied by  the  retirement  allow-
 ance, not to exceed $15,000. The initial maximum Supplemental Retirement
 Allowance  would  not exceed $1,350 per year (i.e., $15,000 x 0.25% x 36
 months = $1,350 per year). The Supplemental Retirement  Allowance  would
 A. 7821--A  6

 be  in  lieu  of  any  other  retirement  benefit  provided for military
 service.
  The  full  Supplemental  Retirement Allowance would be payable for the
 Eligible Recipient's lifetime and half of  the  Supplemental  Retirement
 Allowance would be payable to a surviving spouse if the retiree chose an
 optional  form of payment. The initial Supplemental Retirement Allowance
 would be subject to the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) provisions, but
 only to the extent that the total  retirement  allowance  including  the
 Supplemental Retirement Allowance is less than $18,000 per year.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  o Military service for members who retired prior to May 31, 2016 would
 be consistent with active military service purchased under Chapter 41 of
 the  Law  of  2016  (i.e.,  percent of population with eligible service,
 eligible military service of 2.5 years).
  o Joint and Survivor elections would be the same percentage as current
 retirees.
  o The average COLA applicable to the Supplemental Retirement Allowance
 was assumed to be zero.
  o The Supplemental Retirement Allowance was  assumed  to  be  provided
 without cost to Eligible Recipients.
  The  number  of  retirees  who  will  benefit from this fiscal note is
 unknown.  The cost of this  proposed  legislation  could  vary  greatly
 depending on the number of retirees who benefit.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
