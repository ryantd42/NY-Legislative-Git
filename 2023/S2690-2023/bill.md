 department  of the public corporation voluntarily to subscribe to such a
 plan or plans to provide such insurance for or service to themselves and
 their families. The comptroller  or  other  disbursing  officer  of  the
 public corporation, or of any fund out of which officers or employees of
 such public corporation are paid, is authorized to deduct from the wages
 or  salary  of such contracting or subscribing officer or employee, with
 his prior consent, in writing, the sums required  to  be  paid  by  such
 officer  or employee to such non-profit membership corporation or insur-
 ance company. Such public corporation, if such contract or plan provides
 that the employer shall contribute a share of the cost of  such  medical

 thereof. Where the compensation of any officer or employee  whose  posi-
 tion is covered by medical and surgical services and hospital service or
 medical  and surgical and hospital insurance pursuant to this section is
 paid from a special or administrative fund  provided  for  by  law,  the
 contributions  required  to  be  paid by the public corporation for such
 coverage shall be paid from such special  or  administrative  fund.  The
 public  corporation shall be authorized to pay directly to such non-pro-
 fit membership corporation or to such insurance company,  the  total  of
 such appropriation and of such officer and employee deductions.
