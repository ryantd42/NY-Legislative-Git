  other  inconsistent  provision  of law, if
  necessary funding, as  determined  by  the
  director  of  the  budget, is secured in a

  organizations by  the  amount  of  savings
  resulting  from stably housing individuals
  living  with  medically  diagnosed  HIV
  infection as defined by the AIDS institute
  of  the  state  department  of health, the

  department  of health, the social services
  district shall make such payments of addi-

  mined  based  on  limiting  such  person's
  earned and/or unearned income contribution
  to 30 percent in social services districts
  with  a  population  of  five  million  or
