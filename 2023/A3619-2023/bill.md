  8. a. The duties and responsibilities of the franchise oversight board
 shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (i)  represent  the interests of the state in all real estate develop-
 ment proposed for Aqueduct  racetrack  or  real  estate  development  at
 Belmont  Park  racetrack. Any such real estate development shall only be
 undertaken pursuant to a competitive  process  approved  by  the  board,
 after consultation with the applicable local advisory boards and consid-
 eration  of  local  zoning and planning regulation, and in a manner that
 will not adversely impact any historic structure that is included in  or
 eligible for inclusion in the National or the State Register of Historic
 Places,  be  consistent  with  any plan approved for such community, and
 shall be subject to unanimous approval of the franchise oversight  board
 and  all statutory and regulatory requirements; provided, however, that,
 subject to approval of the franchise oversight board and subject to  all
 statutory  and regulatory requirements, the franchised corporation shall
 have full powers and rights to develop, redevelop,  refurbish,  renovate
 or  make  such other improvements, capital expenditures or otherwise, to
 the racetracks and the fixtures and improvements thereon consistent with
 projects  specifically  identified  in  the  franchised  corporation's
 approved track facility improvement plan.
  The franchise oversight board shall be guided by the goals of ensuring
 the continuation of high quality thoroughbred racing at the thoroughbred
 racing  facilities  located  within the state, raising revenue for or in
 aid or support of education in this state from video lottery  gaming  at
 facilities  of  the  state  racing franchise, and maximizing revenue for
 governments from pari-mutuel wagering on racing  at  facilities  of  the
 state racing franchise.
  (ii)  monitor  and  enforce  compliance with definitive documents that
 comprise the franchise agreement between the franchised corporation  and
 the  state  of New York governing the franchised corporation's operation
 of thoroughbred racing and pari-mutuel wagering at the  racetracks.  The
 franchise  agreement  shall contain objective performance standards that
 shall allow contract review in a manner consistent  with  this  chapter.
 The  franchise  oversight  board shall notify the franchised corporation
 authorized by this chapter in writing of  any  material  breach  of  the
 performance  standards or repeated non-material breaches which the fran-
 chise oversight board may determine collectively constitute  a  material
 breach  of the performance standards. Prior to taking any action against
 such franchised corporation, the franchise oversight board shall provide
 the franchised corporation with the reasonable opportunity to  cure  any
 material  breach  of  the performance standards or repeated non-material
 breaches which the franchise oversight board may determine  collectively
 constitute a material breach of the performance standards.  Upon a writ-
 ten  finding  of  a  material  breach  of  the  performance standards or
 repeated non-material breaches which the franchise oversight  board  may
 determine  collectively  constitute a material breach of the performance
 standards, the franchise oversight board may recommend  that  the  fran-
 chise agreement be terminated. The franchise oversight board shall refer
 such  recommendation  to the commission for a hearing conducted pursuant
 to section two hundred forty-five of this article for a determination of
 whether to terminate the franchise agreement with the franchised  corpo-
 ration;
  (iii)  oversee,  monitor  and  review all significant transactions and
 operations of the franchised corporation AND THE NEW YORK CITY OFF-TRACK
 BETTING CORPORATION authorized by this chapter; provided, however,  that
 nothing  in  this  section shall be deemed to reduce, diminish or impede
 A. 3619  3
 
 the authority of the commission to, pursuant  to  article  one  of  this
 chapter,  determine and enforce compliance by the franchised corporation
 OR THE NEW YORK CITY OFF-TRACK BETTING CORPORATION with terms of  racing
 laws  and  regulations. Such oversight shall include, but not be limited
 to:
  (A) review and make recommendations concerning  the  annual  operating
 budgets  of  such franchised corporation AND THE NEW YORK CITY OFF-TRACK
 BETTING CORPORATION;
  (B) review and make recommendations concerning operating revenues  and
 the establishment of a financial plan;
  (C)  review  and  make recommendations concerning accounting, internal
 control systems and security procedures;

 TRACK BETTING CORPORATION'S compliance with the laws,  rules  and  regu-
 lations applicable to its activities;
  (F)  make recommendations for establishing model governance principles
 to improve accountability and transparency; and

 YORK  CITY  OFF-TRACK  BETTING  CORPORATION'S  selection  of a vendor or
 vendors to contract with the franchised corporation  AND  THE  NEW  YORK
 CITY  OFF-TRACK  BETTING  CORPORATION  for  provision  of  totalizator
 services, and manage, subject to the franchised corporation's unilateral
 right to opt out, directly or indirectly,  integration  of  any  offered
 internet wagering platform. The franchise oversight board shall consider
 in its evaluation of any such proposed vendor the ability of such vendor
 to  reduce  the  totalizator  expenses  and  general  development  and
 production costs of any internet  wagering  platform  of  an  authorized
 off-track betting corporation and the state racing franchise holder.
  (v)  facilitate discussions and voluntary agreements between the fran-
 chised corporation and  off-track  betting  corporations  to  streamline
 operations, decrease operating costs and maximize opportunities pertain-
 ing  to costs and revenues, and encourage an exchange of views and expe-
 riences from the franchised corporation and the off-track betting corpo-
 rations to improve the  racing  product  in  New  York  and  to  realize
 efficiencies,  EXCEPT  THE  NEW  YORK CITY OFF-TRACK BETTING CORPORATION

 BALANCES HELD FOR TELEPHONE AND INTERNET WAGERING TO THE FRANCHISE OVER-

 the manner provided by law or have  been  relinquished  by  such  corpo-
 ration,  or  such corporation declines to continue conducting race meet-
 ings and pari-mutuel betting on the outcome of the same as  required  by
 such  franchises  unless such declination is the result of strikes, acts

 provided to the franchise oversight board, and  such  deviation  is  not
 mitigated  by  the franchised corporation within one hundred eighty days
 of the franchise oversight board providing notice of such  determination

 icant  risk to the liquidity of the franchised corporation, in any order

 financial adviser to evaluate the financial position of  the  franchised
 corporation and report on such to the franchise oversight board; and
  (B)  require  the  franchised  corporation to submit for the franchise
 oversight board's approval  a  corrective  action  plan  addressing  any
 concerns identified as risks by the franchise oversight board.
  (xix)  when  the franchise oversight board finds the franchised corpo-
 ration has experienced two consecutive years of material losses  due  to
 circumstances  within  the  control  of  the  franchised corporation, as
 determined by the franchise oversight board,  and  when  the  franchised
 corporation  has  failed to address concerns identified by the franchise

 sight  board, approve the use of withheld racing support payments neces-
 sary to satisfy financial instruments used to fund board-approved  capi-

 A. 3619  6

 historic  structure  that is included in or is eligible for inclusion in
 the national or state register of historic places, to the physical plant
 of the racetracks, grandstand, backstretch, parking and public areas set
 forth  in  the  New  York  Racing Association's capital expenditure plan
 ("capital plan") filed with the racing and wagering board in  two  thou-
 sand  seven. Any material modification to the capital plan as determined
 by the franchise oversight board and each future capital investment plan
 for the tracks, grandstand, backstretch, parking and public areas of the
 racetracks operated by the franchised corporation involving the expendi-
 ture of more than five million dollars in the  aggregate  shall  require
 the  prior  approval of the franchise oversight board. Within five years
 from the date of commencement of the video lottery  terminal  operations
 at Aqueduct, and every five years thereafter, the franchised corporation
 shall  submit  to  the  oversight board a capital plan for the five-year
 period commencing on January first of the  following  year.  Such  plans
 shall  contain  both the intended object of expenditure and the proposed
 sources of financing. The franchised corporation  shall  report  to  the
 franchise  oversight  board within ninety days following the end of each
 fiscal year as to the amount spent pursuant to the capital plan.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately;  provided,  however,  the
 amendments to section 212 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breed-
 ing  law  made  by  section  one of this act shall be deemed repealed as
 provided by chapter 354 of the laws of 2005, as amended.
