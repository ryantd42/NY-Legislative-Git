 system  or  septic system components, or installation of enhanced treat-
 ment technologies, including an advanced  nitrogen  removal  system,  to

  2.  (a) There is hereby created the state  septic  system  replacement
 AND  SEWER  CONNECTION  fund,  which shall be administered by the corpo-
 ration to reimburse property owners or at the written request of a prop-
 erty owner, the septic system installer OR LICENSED  PLUMBER  contracted
 by  the  property  owner,  for up to fifty percent of the eligible costs
 incurred for  eligible  septic  system  projects  OR  RESIDENTIAL  SEWER
 CONNECTION PROJECTS, provided that no property owner shall be reimbursed
 more  than  ten  thousand  dollars  and  no  septic  system installer OR

 CONNECTION COSTS,  and  costs  of  the  system,  system  components,  or
 enhanced  treatment technologies, but shall not include costs associated
 with routine maintenance such as a pump out of a septic tank.
  (c) The department of environmental conservation, in consultation with
 the department of health and participating counties, shall from the list
 of participating counties establish priority geographic  areas  and,  in
 the  absence  of  county  information,  identify  eligible septic system
 projects OR RESIDENTIAL SEWER CONNECTION PROJECTS, based  on  an  area's
 vulnerability  to contamination, including the presence of a sole source
 aquifer, or known water quality impairment, population  density,  soils,
 hydrogeology, climate, and reasonable ability for septic system projects
 to  mitigate  water  quality  impacts.  The  department of environmental
 conservation may delegate to a participating county  the  identification
 of priority geographic areas.  The department of environmental conserva-
 tion,  in  consultation  with  participating  counties in which priority
 areas have been identified, shall determine the amount of money from the
 fund to be provided to  each  participating  county  based  on  density,
 demand  for  reimbursement from the fund and the criteria used to estab-
 lish the priority geographic  areas.  The  corporation  shall  publish
 information,  application  forms,  procedures and guidelines relating to
 the program on its website and in a manner that  is  accessible  to  the
 public.
  (d)  The corporation shall provide state financial assistance payments
 from the fund, from moneys appropriated by the legislature and available

 system  replacement  AND  SEWER  CONNECTION  program  to support [septic
 system] projects within their municipal boundaries undertaken by proper-
 ty owners within their  municipal  boundaries.  Where  such  project  is
 located  in  a  priority geographic area identified by the department of
 environmental  conservation  as  threatened  or  impaired  by  nitrogen,
 including groundwater used as drinking water, such septic system project
 must reduce nitrogen levels by at least thirty percent.
  (e)  The  corporation  shall  make payments monthly to a participating
 county upon the receipt by the corporation of a certification  from  the
 A. 7538--A  3
 
 participating  county  of  the  total  costs incurred by property owners
 within its municipal boundaries for septic system  OR  SEWER  CONNECTION
 projects  within  its  municipal  boundaries  that  are  eligible  for
 reimbursement from the fund.
  3.  (a) A participating county shall notify property owners who may be
 eligible to participate in the program.  Determinations  of  eligibility
 will  be made by the participating county based on the published program
 criteria and consideration of a property's location  in  relation  to  a
 waterbody, impacts to groundwater used as drinking water, and the condi-
 tion of the property owner's current septic system as determined by:
  (i) the county health department official; or
  (ii)  other  designated  authority  having  jurisdiction,  pursuant to
 septic inspections required by a municipal separate storm  sewer  system
 permit; or
  (iii)  a  septic contractor pursuant to the applicable county sanitary
 code provided, however, in cases where a property owner  has  authorized
 in writing such contractor to receive reimbursement directly, additional
 verification shall be required.
  (b)  An  owner  of  property served by a septic system or cesspool may
 apply to a participating county on an application substantially  in  the
 form provided by the corporation.
  (c) Property owners in participating counties must have signed a prop-
 erty  owner  participation agreement with the county before the start of

 agreement  must be substantially in the form provided by the corporation
 and include, without limitation, the program's goals, guidelines, eligi-
 bility requirements and reimbursement procedures.

 submitting  to  the  participating  county  a reimbursement application,
 which must include at least:
  (i) a signed property owner participation agreement;
  (ii) a completed reimbursement application form substantially  in  the
 form provided by the corporation;
  (iii)  any applicable design approval for the septic system project OR
 SEWER CONNECTION PROJECT;
  (iv) description of all work completed;
  (v) cost documentation and invoice or invoices for eligible costs; and
  (vi) any written authorization for a septic system installer OR  PLUM-
 BER to receive reimbursement directly.
  (e)  Participating  counties  will  be responsible for reviewing their
 property owners' applications and approving, modifying  or  denying  the
 reimbursement requests as appropriate and issuing reimbursement payments
 to property owners from financial assistance payments made to the county
 from the fund.
  (f)  Participation  in  this program and the receipt of payments shall
 not prevent participating counties from providing additional  reimburse-
 ment to property owners.
  (g)  Subject  to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this subdivision,
 the county may set graduated incentive reimbursement  rates  for  septic
 system  projects  OR  SEWER  CONNECTION  PROJECTS  to maximize pollution
 reduction outcomes.
  4. On or before March first, two thousand nineteen, and annually ther-
 eafter, the corporation shall submit  to  the  governor,  the  temporary
 president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly a report regard-
 ing the program. Such report shall include, but shall not be limited to,
 the  number  and amount of grants provided, the number and amount of any
