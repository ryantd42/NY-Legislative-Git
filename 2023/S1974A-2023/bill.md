 FOR THE CLAIMANT'S PRESCRIBED MEDICATION AND THE CLAIMANT IS  UNABLE  TO
 OBTAIN THE PRESCRIBED MEDICATION FROM A PHARMACY WITH WHICH THE EMPLOYER
 OR  CARRIER  HAS  A  CONTRACT  DUE  TO  THE  FAILURE  TO  AUTHORIZE SUCH
 PRESCRIBED MEDICATION WITHIN SEVENTY-TWO HOURS OF SUCH REQUEST; OR
  (B) THE PRESCRIBED MEDICATION IS SCHEDULED FOR REAUTHORIZATION BUT THE
 EMPLOYER OR CARRIER HAS FAILED TO REAUTHORIZE SUCH PRESCRIBED MEDICATION
