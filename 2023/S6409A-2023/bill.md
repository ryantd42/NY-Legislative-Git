 follows:
  1. (a) The amount of such tax abatement for any tax year commencing on
 or  after  July  first,  two  thousand nine and ending on or before June
 thirtieth, two thousand fourteen shall be four dollars and  fifty  cents
 per  square foot of a green roof pursuant to an approved application for
 tax abatement; provided, however, that the amount of such tax  abatement
 shall  not exceed the lesser of (i) one hundred thousand dollars or (ii)
 the tax liability for the eligible building in the tax year in which the
 tax abatement is taken.
  (b) The total amount of such tax abatement commencing on or after July

 to  the tax liability in succeeding tax years, provided that such abate-
 ment must be applied within five years of the tax year in which the  tax
 abatement was initially taken.
  (c)  Notwithstanding  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  property
 located  within  specifically  designated  New  York  city  community
 districts,  selected by an agency designated by the mayor of the city of
 New York pursuant to subdivision five of this section, shall receive  an
 enhanced  tax  abatement for any green roof [with a growth medium with a
 depth of at least four inches]. The total amount of  such  enhanced  tax
 abatement  commencing  on or after July first, two thousand nineteen and
 ending on or before June thirtieth, two thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-
 SEVEN, shall be fifteen dollars per square foot of a green roof pursuant
 to  an approved application for enhanced tax abatement: provided, howev-
 er, that the amount of such enhanced tax abatement shall not exceed  two
 hundred  thousand dollars. To the extent the amount of such enhanced tax
 abatement exceeds the total tax liability in any tax year, any remaining
 amount may be applied to the tax  liability  in  succeeding  tax  years,
 provided  that  such  abatement must be applied within five years of the
 tax year in which the tax abatement was initially taken.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) or  (c)  of  this  subdivision,  the
 aggregate  amount  of  tax abatements allowed under this subdivision for
 the tax year commencing July first, two  thousand  fourteen  and  ending
 June thirtieth, two thousand fifteen shall be a maximum of seven hundred
 fifty  thousand  dollars,  and  the  aggregate  amount of tax abatements
 allowed under this subdivision for any tax year commencing on  or  after
 July first, two thousand fifteen and ending on or before June thirtieth,
 two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SEVEN shall be a maximum of [one] FOUR
 million  dollars. No tax abatements shall be allowed under this subdivi-
 sion for any tax year commencing on or after July  first,  two  thousand
 [twenty-four] TWENTY-SEVEN.
  (e)  Such  aggregate  amount  of tax abatements including enhanced tax
 abatements, shall be allocated by the department of finance  on  a  [pro
 rata]  FIRST  COME FIRST SERVE basis among applicants whose applications
 have been approved by a designated agency. If  such  allocation  is  not
 made  prior  to  the  date that the real property tax bill, statement of
 account or other similar bill or statement is prepared, then the depart-
 ment of finance shall, as necessary,  after  such  allocation  is  made,
 S. 6409--A  3
 
 submit  an amended real property tax bill, statement of account or other
 similar bill or statement to  any  applicant  whose  abatement  must  be
 adjusted  to reflect such allocation. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
 deemed  to  affect  the  obligation of any taxpayer under applicable law
 with respect to the payment of any installment of real property tax  for
 the  fiscal  year as to which such allocation is made, which was due and
 payable prior to the date such amended real property tax bills are sent,
 and the department of finance shall be authorized to determine the  date
 on which amended bills are to be sent and the installments of real prop-
 erty tax which are to be reflected therein.
