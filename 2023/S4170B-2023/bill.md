  Higher Education
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the education law, in relation to prohibiting legacy
  preference and early decision admission policies at  higher  education
  institutions in this state

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act may be known and shall  be  cited  as
 the "fair college admissions act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent. a. The legislature hereby finds that there
 are significant income gains  associated  with  postsecondary  education
 degree  attainment,  with  New  York  state  residents with a bachelor's
 degree three times less likely to live in poverty than those with a high
 school diploma.
  b. The legislature further finds that students who attend and graduate
 from a highly selective higher education institution in the state of New
 York are much more likely to earn salaries in the  top  income  quintile
 than  those  who  graduate  from less selective institutions, furthering
 economic and social inequality.
  c. The legislature further finds that  within  most  highly  selective
 higher education institutions in New York state, degree completion rates
 for  students  from  low-income and working class family backgrounds are
 comparable to students from upper-income family backgrounds.
  d. The legislature further finds that many four-year higher  education
 institutions in New York state consider whether a prospective student is
 related to alumni as part of the admissions process.
  e. The legislature further finds that providing preferential treatment
 to  students  related  to  alumni  of  a higher education institution is
 discriminatory in nature and disproportionately hurts students who  come
 from  working  class  and  low-income families, have parents who did not

 earn a bachelor's degree, are  undocumented,  are  immigrants,  and  are
 members of historically underrepresented minority groups formerly denied
 entry  into specific higher education institutions either as a matter of
 institution  policy or the effect of historic underlying law and govern-
 ment practices.
  f. The legislature further finds that 30 percent  of  bachelor  degree
 granting institutions in the state of New York currently employ an early
 decision  admissions policy that allows students to apply in the fall of
 their senior year and receive an application  decision  by  December  in
 exchange  for  committing  to  attend  that institution and foregoing an
 opportunity to compare  financial  aid  packages  offered  by  competing
 institutions of higher education.
  g.  The legislature further finds that at a number of higher education
 institutions, particularly highly selective institutions with low  admit
 rates, between 40 and 50 percent of enrolled students are admitted early
 decision, and early decision applicants are more than twice as likely to
 be admitted.
  h.  The  legislature further finds that early decision admission poli-
 cies are discriminatory in nature, as they favor  students  with  strong
 college  advising  and  the ability to commit to a college or university
 without considering a financial aid package. They  put  first-generation
 students,  students  at  under-resourced high schools, and students from
 working class and low-income backgrounds at a disadvantage because  they
 lack  awareness  of the strategic benefit of applying early decision and
 do not have the luxury of committing to an institution  without  knowing
 the post-financial aid cost of attendance.
  i.  The  legislature further finds that inequitable, unfair admissions
 policies and practices such as legacy preference and early decision  are
 a  significant  factor  behind  disparities  in college enrollment among
 students from historically underserved  racial  and  economic  subgroups
 compared  to  their  more advantaged peers at selective higher education
 institutions.
  j. The legislature hereby declares that a prohibition on legacy  pref-
 erence  and  early  decision  admissions  policies  at  degree-granting
 colleges and universities in the state shall further the goals of educa-
 tional, economic, and social equity, helping to diversify highly  selec-
 tive  institutions  while  closing achievement gaps between historically
 advantaged and disadvantaged groups, and shall commit to  achieving  the
 same with the following provisions of this act.
  §  3.  The  education  law is amended by adding a new section 239-c to
 read as follows:

 INCLUDED AMONG THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION  USES
 TO CONSIDER AN APPLICANT FOR ADMISSION.
  (B) "EARLY ACTION" SHALL MEAN AN ADMISSIONS PLAN THAT ALLOWS A STUDENT
