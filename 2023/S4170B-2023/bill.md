 AN ACT to amend the education law, in  relation  to  prohibiting  legacy
  admission policies at higher education institutions in this state
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act may be known and shall  be  cited  as
 the "fair college admissions act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent. a. The legislature hereby finds that there
 are significant income gains  associated  with  postsecondary  education
 degree  attainment,  with  New  York  state  residents with a bachelor's
 degree three times less likely to live in poverty than those with a high
 school diploma.
  b. The legislature further finds that students who attend and graduate
 from a highly selective higher education institution in the state of New
 York are much more likely to earn salaries in the  top  income  quintile
 than  those  who  graduate  from less selective institutions, furthering
 economic and social inequality.
  c. The legislature further finds that  within  most  highly  selective
 higher education institutions in New York state, degree completion rates
 for  students  from  low-income and working class family backgrounds are
 comparable to students from upper-income family backgrounds.
  d. The legislature further finds that many four-year higher  education
 institutions in New York state consider whether a prospective student is
 related to alumni as part of the admissions process.
  e. The legislature further finds that providing preferential treatment
 to  students  related  to  alumni  of  a higher education institution is
 discriminatory in nature and disproportionately hurts students who  come
 from  working  class  and  low-income families, have parents who did not
 earn a bachelor's degree, are  undocumented,  are  immigrants,  and  are
 members of historically underrepresented minority groups formerly denied

 entry  into specific higher education institutions either as a matter of
 institution policy or the effect of historic underlying law and  govern-
 ment practices.
  f.  The  legislature further finds that inequitable, unfair admissions
 policies and practices such as legacy consideration  are  a  significant
 factor  behind  disparities  in  college  enrollment among students from
 historically underserved racial and economic subgroups compared to their
 more advantaged peers at selective higher education institutions.
  g. The legislature hereby declares that a prohibition on legacy admis-
 sion policies at degree-granting colleges and universities in the  state
 shall  further  the  goals  of educational, economic, and social equity,
 helping  to  diversify  highly  selective  institutions  while  closing
 achievement  gaps  between  historically  advantaged  and  disadvantaged
 groups, and shall commit  to  achieving  the  same  with  the  following
 provisions of this act.
  §  3.  The  education  law is amended by adding a new section 239-c to
 read as follows:
  § 239-C. PROHIBITION ON LEGACY ADMISSION POLICIES. 1.  DEFINITIONS. AS
 USED IN THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEAN-
 INGS:
  (A) "CONSIDER ALUMNI/AE RELATION AS  A  FACTOR  IN  ADMISSIONS"  SHALL
 REFER  TO  WHEN  AN  ADMISSIONS  APPLICATION ASKS APPLICANTS TO INDICATE
 WHERE THEIR RELATIVES ATTENDED COLLEGE  AND  THAT  SUCH  INFORMATION  IS
 INCLUDED  AMONG THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION USES
 TO CONSIDER AN APPLICANT FOR ADMISSION.
  (B) "HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION" SHALL MEAN THE STATE UNIVERSITY  OF

  2.  PROHIBITION.  NO  HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION IN THIS STATE SHALL
 CONSIDER ALUMNI/AE RELATION AS A FACTOR IN ADMISSIONS.  SUCH PROHIBITION
 SHALL NOT APPLY, HOWEVER, TO A HIGHER EDUCATION  INSTITUTION  THAT  ASKS
 APPLICANTS  ABOUT  RELATIONS  TO  ALUMNI/AE OF SUCH INSTITUTION AFTER AN
 OFFER OF ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID HAS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR THE  PURPOSES
 OF DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.
  3.  PENALTY.  A  VIOLATION  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF THIS SECTION SHALL
