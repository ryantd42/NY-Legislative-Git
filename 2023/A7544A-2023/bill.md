  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Dawn Ward, who was employed with the village of Kensington with a  start
 date  of November 1, 1993, and who is currently a member of the New York
 state and local employees' retirement system, who through  no  fault  of
 her  own did not become a member of the New York state and local employ-
 ees' retirement system on November 1, 1993 when first  employed  by  the
 village  of Kensington, shall be deemed to have been a member of the New
 York state and local employees'  retirement  system  on  such  date  she
 commenced  her  employment and shall be granted Tier IV status, provided
 that an application is filed with the head of the  New  York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement  system within one year from the effective
 date of this act.  Upon the granting of  such  retroactive  membership,
 Dawn  Ward  shall  not  be granted a refund of any employee contribution
 made by her to the  New  York  state  and  local  employees'  retirement
 system.
  §  2.  All  past  services costs associated with the implementation of
 this act shall be borne by the village of Kensington.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would grant Tier 4 status in the New York  State  and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement  System to Dawn Ward, a current Tier 5 member, by
 changing their date of membership to November 1, 1993. There will be  no
 refund of member contributions.

 annual contributions of the Village of Great Neck, $520  in  the  annual
 contributions  of  the  Village  of  Kensington,  and $160 in the annual
 contributions of the Village of  Baxter  Estates  for  the  fiscal  year
 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of Dawn Ward change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $300 which will be borne
 by  the  Village  of  Kensington  as  a  one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
