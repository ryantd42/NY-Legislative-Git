  relation to appropriations included in the governor's budget proposal

  Section  1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 3 of article
 7 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 3. At the time of submitting  the  budget  to  the  legislature  the
 governor shall submit a bill or bills containing all the proposed appro-
 priations  and  reappropriations included in the budget and the proposed
 legislation, if any, recommended  therein.  THE  GOVERNOR  SHALL  ONLY
 INCLUDE  MONETARY ITEMS AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS AND RE-APPROPRIATIONS
 FOR THE APPLICABLE FISCAL YEAR AND ALL SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES  TO  EXISTING
 LAW,  TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT, SHALL BE SET FORTH IN SEPARATE LEGISLATION
 FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE.
  The governor may at any time within thirty days thereafter  and,  with
 the consent of the legislature, at any time before the adjournment ther-
 eof,  amend  or supplement the budget and submit amendments to any bills
 submitted by him or her or submit supplemental bills.
  The governor and the heads of departments shall have the right, and it
 shall be the duty of the heads of departments when requested  by  either
 house  of the legislature or an appropriate committee thereof, to appear
 and be heard in respect to the budget during the consideration  thereof,
 and to answer inquiries relevant thereto. The procedure for such appear-
 ances and inquiries shall be provided by law.
  §  2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment be
 referred to the first regular legislative session  convening  after  the
 next  succeeding  general  election  of members of the assembly, and, in
 conformity with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution,  be
 published for three months previous to the time of such election.
