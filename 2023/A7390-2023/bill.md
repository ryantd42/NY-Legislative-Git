 under section forty-one hundred forty-eight of this article, information

 sioner  and  the  date  of such filing. The commissioner shall develop a
 unique, confidential identifier to be used on the certificate  of  fetal

 authority to monitor the quality of care provided by any  individual  or
 entity licensed to perform an abortion in this state and to permit coor-
 dination  of  data  concerning  the  medical  history  of  the woman for
 purposes of conducting  surveillance  scientific  studies  and  research

 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (j)  of subdivision one of
 section two hundred six of this chapter.
  2.  In  each case where a physician [or], nurse practitioner, MIDWIFE,
 OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT was in attendance at or after a fetal  death,  it
 is  the duty of such [physician or nurse] practitioner to certify to the
 birth and to the cause of death on the fetal death certificate. [Where a
 nurse-midwife was in attendance at a fetal death it is the duty of  such
 nurse-midwife  to  certify to the birth but, he or she shall not certify
 to the cause of death on the fetal death certificate.]
  3. Fetal deaths occurring without the attendance of  a  [physician  or
 nurse] practitioner as provided in subdivision two of this section shall
 be  treated  as  deaths  without medical attendance, as provided in this
 article.
  4. When a fetal death occurs in a  hospital,  except  in  those  cases
 where  certificates  are  issued  by  coroners or medical examiners, the
 person in charge of such hospital or his  or  her  designated  represen-
 tative  shall  promptly  present  the certificate to the physician [or],
 nurse practitioner, MIDWIFE, OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT in attendance, or  a
 physician  [or],  nurse  practitioner,  MIDWIFE,  OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT
 acting in his or her behalf, who shall promptly certify to the facts  of
 birth  and  of  fetal death, provide the medical information required by
 the certificate, sign the medical certificate of birth  and  death,  and
 thereupon  return  such certificate to such person, so that the seventy-
 two hour registration time limit prescribed in section four thousand one
 hundred sixty of this title can be met; provided, however that  commenc-
 ing  on or after the implementation date under section forty-one hundred
 forty-eight of this article, information and signatures required by this
 subdivision shall be  obtained  and  made  in  accordance  with  section
 forty-one hundred forty-eight of this article.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
