  (f) falsely impersonating a duly registered radiologic technologist OR

 duly authorized professional disciplinary agency of another state, where
 the conduct resulting in the revocation, suspension or  other  discipli-
 nary  action  involving the license or refusal, revocation or suspension
 of an application for a license or the surrender of the  license  would,
 if committed in New York state, constitute professional misconduct under
 the  laws  of New York state. A radiologic technologist OR LIMITED-SCOPE
 RADIOGRAPHER licensed in New York state who is also licensed or  seeking
 licensure in another state must immediately report to the department any
 revocation,  suspension  or other disciplinary action involving the out-
 of-state license or refusal, revocation or suspension of an  application
 for  an  out-of-state  license  or  the  surrender  of  the out-of-state
 license.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
