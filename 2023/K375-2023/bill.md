  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Lupus Awareness Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year, the Lupus Agencies of New York State designate
May as Lupus Awareness  Month  to  show  support  for  the  105,400  New
Yorkers, 1.5 million Americans and 5 million people worldwide who suffer
from  the  often  debilitating  effects  of  Lupus, a chronic autoimmune
disease that can cause severe damage to the tissue  and  organs  in  the
body and, in some cases, death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  thousands  of  people are newly diagnosed with
Lupus, the great majority of whom are young people in the prime of their
lives, and 90% of whom are women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lupus  is  most  prevalent  among  African-Americans,
Hispanics/Latinos,  Native  Americans, and Asians; tragically, thousands
of people die from Lupus each year because a cure remains elusive; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many health  professionals  are  unaware  of  symptoms  and
health  effects  of  Lupus, causing people with Lupus to suffer for many
years before they obtain a  correct  diagnosis  and  medical  treatment,
demonstrating  the  need for increased public and professional awareness
of Lupus; and
 
  WHEREAS, Medical research efforts into Lupus and  the  discovery  of
safer,  more effective treatments for Lupus patients are under-funded in
comparison with diseases of comparable magnitude and severity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increasing  community  awareness  and  focusing  public
attention  on  Lupus  and its devastating impact on patients' lives will
provide hope for a better future for those affected; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lupus Agencies of  New  York  State  are  dedicated  to
improving the quality of life for individuals with Lupus and their loved
ones  by  providing  education,  support  and  outreach  services,  and
promoting programs of awareness, advocacy, and research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  needs  of  those
chronically  ill people who are living with Lupus and urges all citizens
to support the search for  a  cure  and  assist  those  individuals  and
families  who  deal with this devastating disease on a daily basis; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as Lupus
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the Lupus Agencies of New York State.
