 AN ACT to amend the public buildings law, in relation to  the  authority
  of the commissioner of general services to  lease public buildings

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 12 of section 3 of the public buildings law, as
 amended by section 47 of part T of chapter 57 of the laws  of  2007,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  12. Lease from time to time buildings, rooms or premises in the county
 of  Albany,  and  elsewhere as required, for providing space for depart-
 ments, commissions, boards and officers of the  state  government,  upon
 such  terms  and  conditions as he or she deems most advantageous to the
 state. Any such lease shall, however, be for a term  not  exceeding  ten
 years,  except that, the commissioner of general services may enter into
 leases for a term not exceeding fifteen years when, in the  judgment  of
 such  commissioner,  such  longer  term  is in the best interests of the
 state. Any such lease may provide for optional renewals on the  part  of
 the state, for terms of ten years or less. Each such lease shall contain
 a  clause  stating  that  the  contract of the state thereunder shall be
 deemed executory only to the extent of  moneys  available  therefor  and
 that no liability shall be incurred by the state beyond the money avail-
 able for such purpose.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,
 except section sixteen hundred seventy-six of the public authorities law
 relating  to  use  of  dormitory  authority  facilities by the aged, the
 commissioner of general services shall have sole and exclusive authority
 to lease space for state departments, agencies, commissions, boards  and
 officers  within the county of Albany. Any buildings, rooms or premises,
 now or hereafter held by the  commissioner  of  general  services  under
 lease, may be sublet, in part or in whole, provided that in the judgment

 of  such  commissioner, and the occupying department, commission, board,
 and officers of the state government, such buildings, rooms or  premises
 are  not  for  a  time  needed. EACH SUCH LEASE WITH A LIMITED LIABILITY
 COMPANY  SHALL IDENTIFY THE NAMES AND RESIDENCE ADDRESSES OF ALL NATURAL
 PERSONS WHO ARE TO BE THE MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND ANY AUTHORIZED  PERSONS,
 IF  ANY,  OF  THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, AND THE NAMES AND RESIDENCE
 ADDRESSES OR, IF NONE, THE BUSINESS ADDRESS OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS,  DIREC-
 TORS,  OFFICERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND PARTNERS OF ANY LIMITED LIABILITY
 COMPANY OR OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY THAT ARE TO BE THE MEMBERS, MANAGERS OR
 AUTHORIZED PERSONS, IF ANY, OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. THE  IDEN-
 TIFICATION  OF SUCH NAMES SHALL NOT BE DEEMED AN UNWARRANTED INVASION OF
 PERSONAL PRIVACY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SIX OF THE PUBLIC OFFICERS LAW.  IF
 ANY  SUCH  MEMBER, MANAGER OR AUTHORIZED PERSON OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY
 COMPANY IS ITSELF A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER BUSINESS  ENTITY,
 THE  NAMES  AND  ADDRESSES  OF  THE  SHAREHOLDERS,  DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
 MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND PARTNERS OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER
 BUSINESS ENTITY SHALL ALSO BE DISCLOSED UNTIL FULL DISCLOSURE  OF  ULTI-
 MATE  OWNERSHIP  BY  NATURAL  PERSONS  IS ACHIEVED. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION,  THE  TERMS  "MEMBERS,"  "MANAGERS,"  "AUTHORIZED  PERSON,"
 "LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY" AND "OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY" SHALL HAVE THE
 SAME MEANING AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN SECTION ONE  HUNDRED  TWO  OF
 THE  LIMITED  LIABILITY COMPANY LAW. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of law to the contrary, if bonds or notes are issued pursuant to section
 sixteen hundred eighty-n of the public authorities law for  the  purpose
 of acquiring a building or other facility previously financed by a lease
 or  lease-purchase  obligation  as  authorized  herein, the state agency
 which is the tenant in  occupancy  shall  be  authorized  to  remit  tax
 payments  or  payments  in  lieu  of  thereof  to the appropriate taxing
 authority in a manner consistent with the process and  term  established
 under  the original lease or lease-purchase for the subject property for
 a period coincident with the term of the lease  as  established  at  the
 commencement  of  the term thereof. The state may undertake a certiorari
 review of assessments that may be imposed from time to time.
  § 2. Subdivision 12 of section 3  of  the  public  buildings  law,  as
 amended  by  section  48 of part T of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007, is
 amended to read as follows:
  12. Lease from time to time buildings, rooms or premises in the county
 of Albany, and elsewhere as required, for providing  space  for  depart-
 ments,  commissions,  boards  and officers of the state government, upon
 such terms and conditions as he or she deems most  advantageous  to  the
 state.  Any  such  lease shall, however, be for a term not exceeding ten
 years, but may provide for optional renewals on the part of  the  state,
 for  terms  of ten years or less. Each such lease shall contain a clause
 stating that the contract of the state thereunder shall be deemed execu-
 tory only to the extent of moneys available therefor and that no liabil-
 ity shall be incurred by the state beyond the money available  for  such
 purpose. EACH SUCH LEASE WITH A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY SHALL IDENTIFY
 THE  NAMES  AND RESIDENCE ADDRESSES OF ALL NATURAL PERSONS WHO ARE TO BE
 THE MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND ANY AUTHORIZED PERSONS, IF ANY, OF THE LIMITED
 LIABILITY COMPANY, AND THE NAMES AND RESIDENCE ADDRESSES  OR,  IF  NONE,
 THE BUSINESS ADDRESS OF ALL SHARE HOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS,
 MANAGERS AND PARTNERS OF ANY LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER BUSINESS
 ENTITY  THAT  ARE  TO BE THE MEMBERS, MANAGERS OR AUTHORIZED PERSONS, IF
 ANY, OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUCH  NAMES
 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED AN UNWARRANTED INVASION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY PURSUANT
 TO  ARTICLE  SIX OF THE PUBLIC OFFICERS LAW. IF ANY SUCH MEMBER, MANAGER

 OR AUTHORIZED PERSON OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY IS ITSELF A LIMIT-
 ED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY, THE NAMES  AND  ADDRESSES
 OF THE SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND PARTNERS
 OF  THE  LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR ANOTHER BUSINESS ENTITY SHALL ALSO
 BE DISCLOSED UNTIL FULL DISCLOSURE  OF  ULTIMATE  OWNERSHIP  BY  NATURAL
 PERSONS  IS  ACHIEVED.  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE TERMS
 "MEMBERS," "MANAGERS," "AUTHORIZED PERSON," "LIMITED LIABILITY  COMPANY"
 AND  "OTHER  BUSINESS ENTITY" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS THOSE TERMS
 ARE DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWO OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY  COMPANY
 LAW.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of any other law, except section
 sixteen hundred seventy-six of the public authorities  law  relating  to
 use  of  dormitory authority facilities by the aged, the commissioner of
 general services shall have sole and exclusive authority to lease  space
 for state departments, agencies, commissions, boards and officers within
 the county of Albany. Any buildings, rooms or premises, now or hereafter
 held by the commissioner of general services under lease, may be sublet,
 in  part or in whole, provided that in the judgment of the commissioner,
 and the occupying department, commission, board,  and  officers  of  the
 state  government,  such buildings, rooms or premises are not for a time
 needed.
  § 3. The commissioner of general services  is  hereby  authorized  and
 directed  to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes
 of this act.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have become a law, provided, however that:
  a. section three of this act shall take effect immediately;
  b.  the provisions of this act shall only apply to leases entered into
 after such effective date; and
  c. the amendments to subdivision 12 of section 3 of the public  build-
 ings law made by section one of this act shall be subject to the expira-
 tion  and  reversion  of  such  subdivision pursuant to subdivision 4 of
 section 27 of chapter 95 of the laws of 2000, as amended, when upon such
 date the provisions of section two of this act shall take effect.
