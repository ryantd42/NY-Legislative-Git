  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions,  to  recognize  celebrations  which  foster
ethnic  pride  and  enhance  the  profile  of  cultural  diversity which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and

American Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Italian  American  Day is a joyous celebration of culture,
civic conviviality and other merriment,  held  annually  throughout  the
State  of New York, in commemoration of the Republic of Italy's National
Holiday, "Festa Della Repubblica Italiana," Italy's 4th  of  July;  this
festive day will be the 50th Anniversary of Italian American Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Festa  Della  Repubblica  Italiana,  a national holiday in
Italy, marks the day when Italy voted, after World War II  and  fascism,
to become a democratic republic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Italian American Day celebrates 50 years of the heritage of
Italy's  glorious  historical  past,  the wealth of its present, and the
opportunities of its future; and

the  significant  contributions  of Italian Americans so that all people
may know and appreciate Italian history and traditions, and of the  role
Italian  Americans  have  played,  and  will  continue  to  play, in our
society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 22, 2023, as Italian
American Day in the State of New York; and be it further
