  11. The attorney general, upon his or her own motion or upon  referral
 from  the  public service commission, the Long Island power authority or
 the department of state, may bring a civil  action  against  any  energy
 services  company  that  violates  any provision of this section and may
 recover  (a)  a  civil  penalty  not  to exceed one thousand dollars per
 violation; and (b) costs and reasonable attorney's  fees.  In  any  such
 proceeding the court may direct restitution.
  [10.]  12.  In addition to the right of action granted to the attorney
 general pursuant to this section, any person who  has  been  injured  by
 reason  of  any  violation of this section may bring an action in his or
 her own name to enjoin such unlawful  act  or  practice,  an  action  to
 recover  his or her actual damages or five hundred dollars, whichever is
 greater, or both  such  actions.  The  court  may,  in  its  discretion,
 increase the award of damages to an amount not to exceed three times the
 actual  damages  up  to  ten  thousand  dollars,  if the court finds the
 defendant willfully or knowingly violated this section.  The  court  may
 award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

 suspend or revoke the eligibility of an energy services company to  sell
 or  offer for sale any energy services for violation of any provision of
 law, rule, regulation  or  policy  enforceable  by  such  commission  or
 authority.
  [12.] 14. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit any author-
 ity of the public service commission or the Long Island power authority,
 which  existed before the effective date of this section, to adopt addi-
 tional guidelines, practices, policies, rules or regulations relating to
 the marketing practices of energy services companies to residential  and
 commercial  customers, whether in person (including door to door), or by
 mail, telephone or other electronic means,  that  are  not  inconsistent
 with the provisions of this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be made on or
 before such date.
