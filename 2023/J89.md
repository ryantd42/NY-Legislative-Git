  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Cancer Research Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  health and well-being of the citizens of the State of
New York are of paramount importance to this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Cancer Research Month in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
Cancer Research Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, more than 10 million cancer survivors are living
in  the United States; cancer research plays an important role in saving
lives and advancing progress against the more than 200 diseases that are
called cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Cancer Research Month recognizes the importance of
cancer  research  and  the  contributions  of  researchers,
physician-scientists, survivors, and patient advocates across the United
States who are dedicated to the conquest of cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thanks  to  spectacular  advances made by cancer research,
more than 15.5 million people in the United  States  and  millions  more
worldwide  are cancer survivors who are living with, through, and beyond
their disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite the significant progress that has been made, cancer
is a growing public health  challenge  globally;  the  immense  toll  of
cancer  is  felt  not  only  through the number of lives it affects each
year, but also through its significant economic impact; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the  local,  State  and  national  levels  to support much needed cancer
research; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Cancer
Research Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
