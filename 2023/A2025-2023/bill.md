 information is presented in a clear, understandable fashion which facil-
 itates comparisons among individual insurers  and  entities,  and  in  a

 other state. The superintendent, in consultation with  the  commissioner
 of  health, may also contract with one or more national organizations to
 assist such commissioner in the collection of data and the analysis  and
 auditing  of  the  clinical  measurers. Such organizations shall consult
 periodically with associations representing health insurers  and  health
 maintenance  organizations  as  well as with consumer representatives in

 dissemination of a consumer's shopping guide for standardized individual
 health  plans  issued  pursuant  to sections four thousand three hundred
 twenty-one and four thousand three hundred twenty-two  of  this  article
 and a separate consumer shopping guide for standardized qualifying indi-
 vidual  health  insurance  contracts  and  standardized qualifying group
