 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  correction  law, in relation to risk assessment
  instruments for sex offenders
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  3 of section 168-d of the correction law, as
 amended by chapter 11 of the  laws  of  2002,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  3.  For sex offenders released on probation or discharged upon payment
 of a fine, conditional discharge or unconditional discharge, it shall be
 the duty of the  court  applying  the  guidelines  AND  RISK  ASSESSMENT
 INSTRUMENT  established  in  subdivision  five  of  section  one hundred
 sixty-eight-l of this article to determine  the  level  of  notification
 pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this
 article and whether such sex offender shall be designated a sexual pred-
 ator, sexually violent offender, or predicate sex offender as defined in
 subdivision  seven of section one hundred sixty-eight-a of this article.
 At least  fifteen  days  prior  to  the  determination  proceeding,  the
 district  attorney  shall  provide  to  the court and the sex offender a
 written  statement  setting  forth  the  determinations  sought  by  the
 district  attorney  together  with the reasons for seeking such determi-
 nations. The court shall allow the sex offender to appear and be  heard.
 The state shall appear by the district attorney, or his or her designee,
 who  shall  bear the burden of proving the facts supporting the determi-
 nations sought by clear and convincing  evidence.  Where  there  is  a
 dispute  between  the  parties  concerning the determinations, the court
 shall adjourn the hearing as necessary to permit the sex offender or the
 district attorney to obtain materials  relevant  to  the  determinations
 from any state or local facility, hospital, institution, office, agency,

 department  or  division.  Such materials may be obtained by subpoena if
 not voluntarily provided to the requesting party. In making the determi-
 nations, the court shall review any victim's statement and any  relevant
 materials  and  evidence  submitted by the sex offender and the district
 attorney and the court may consider reliable hearsay evidence  submitted
 by  either  party  provided  that  it is relevant to the determinations.
 Facts previously proven at trial or elicited at the time of entry  of  a
 plea  of  guilty  shall  be  deemed  established by clear and convincing
 evidence and shall not be relitigated. The court shall render  an  order
 setting  forth  its  determinations and the findings of fact and conclu-
 sions of law on which the determinations are based. A copy of the  order
 shall  be  submitted  by  the court to the division. Upon application of
 either party, the court shall seal any portion  of  the  court  file  or
 record  which  contains material that is confidential under any state or
 federal statute. Either party may appeal as  of  right  from  the  order
 pursuant  to the provisions of articles fifty-five, fifty-six and fifty-
 seven of the civil practice  law  and  rules.  Where  counsel  has  been
 assigned  to  represent  the  sex  offender upon the ground that the sex
 offender is financially unable to retain counsel, that assignment  shall
 be  continued  throughout the pendency of the appeal, and the person may
 appeal as a poor person pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of  the  county
 law.
  §  2. Subdivision 2 of section 168-k of the correction law, as amended
 by chapter 684 of the laws of 2005, is amended to read as follows:
  2. The division shall advise the  board  that  the  sex  offender  has
 established  residence  in this state. The board shall determine whether
 the sex offender is required to register with the  division.  If  it  is
 determined  that  the sex offender is required to register, the division
 shall notify the sex offender of his or her duty to register under  this
 article  and  shall  require  the  sex offender to sign a form as may be
 required by the division acknowledging that the duty to register and the
 procedure for registration has been explained to the sex  offender.  The
 division  shall  obtain  on such form the address where the sex offender
 expects to reside within the state and the sex offender shall retain one
 copy of the form and send two copies to the division which shall provide
 the information to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction  where
 the  sex  offender  expects  to  reside within this state. No later than
 thirty days prior to the board making a recommendation, the sex offender
 shall be notified that his or her case is under review and  that  he  or
 she  is permitted to submit to the board any information relevant to the
 review. After reviewing  any  information  obtained,  and  applying  the
 guidelines  AND  RISK  ASSESSMENT  INSTRUMENT established in subdivision
 five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of  this  article,  the  board
 shall  within  sixty  calendar  days make a recommendation regarding the
 level of notification pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred
 sixty-eight-l of this article and whether such  sex  offender  shall  be
 designated  a  sexual  predator, sexually violent offender, or predicate
 sex offender as defined in subdivision  seven  of  section  one  hundred
 sixty-eight-a  of  this article.  This recommendation shall be confiden-
 tial and shall not be available  for  public  inspection.  It  shall  be
 submitted  by  the board to the county court or supreme court and to the
 district attorney in the county of residence of the sex offender and  to
 the  sex  offender.  It shall be the duty of the county court or supreme
 court in the county of residence  of  the  sex  offender,  applying  the
 guidelines  AND  RISK  ASSESSMENT  INSTRUMENT established in subdivision
 five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this article, to  determine
 S. 4451  3

 the  level  of  notification  pursuant to subdivision six of section one
 hundred sixty-eight-l of this article  and  whether  such  sex  offender
 shall  be  designated  a  sexual predator, sexually violent offender, or
 predicate  sex  offender  as defined in subdivision seven of section one
 hundred sixty-eight-a of this article. At least thirty days prior to the
 determination proceeding, such court shall notify the district  attorney
 and  the  sex  offender,  in  writing,  of the date of the determination
 proceeding and the court shall also provide the  district  attorney  and
 sex  offender  with a copy of the recommendation received from the board
 and any statement of the reasons for the  recommendation  received  from
 the  board.  This  notice  shall  include  the  following statement or a
 substantially similar statement:  "This  proceeding  is  being  held  to
 determine  whether you will be classified as a level 3 offender (risk of
 repeat offense is high), a level 2 offender (risk of repeat  offense  is
 moderate),  or  a  level  1 offender (risk of repeat offense is low), or
 whether you will be designated as a sexual predator, a sexually  violent
 offender  or a predicate sex offender, which will determine how long you
 must register as a sex offender and how much information can be provided
 to the public concerning your registration. If you  fail  to  appear  at
 this  proceeding,  without  sufficient  excuse, it shall be held in your
 absence. Failure to appear may result in a longer period of registration
 or a higher level of community notification because you are not  present
 to offer evidence or contest evidence offered by the district attorney."
 The  court shall also advise the sex offender that he or she has a right
 to a hearing prior to the court's determination, that he or she has  the
 right  to be represented by counsel at the hearing and that counsel will
 be appointed if he or she is financially unable  to  retain  counsel.  A
 returnable  form  shall  be  enclosed  in  the court's notice to the sex
 offender on which the sex offender may apply for assignment of  counsel.
 If  the  sex  offender  applies  for assignment of counsel and the court
 finds that the offender is financially unable  to  retain  counsel,  the
 court  shall  assign  counsel  to represent the sex offender pursuant to
 article eighteen-B of the county law. If the district attorney  seeks  a
 determination  that  differs  from  the  recommendation submitted by the
 board, at least ten days  prior  to  the  determination  proceeding  the
 district  attorney  shall  provide  to  the court and the sex offender a
 statement setting forth the determinations sought by the district attor-
 ney together with the reasons for seeking such determinations. The court
 shall allow the sex offender to appear and be  heard.  The  state  shall
 appear  by the district attorney, or his or her designee, who shall bear
 the burden of proving the facts supporting the determinations sought  by
 clear  and convincing evidence. It shall be the duty of the court apply-
 ing the guidelines AND RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT established in  subdi-
 vision  five  of  section  one  hundred sixty-eight-l of this article to
 determine the level of  notification  pursuant  to  subdivision  six  of
 section  one  hundred sixty-eight-l of this article and whether such sex
 offender shall be designated a sexual predator, sexually violent  offen-
 der,  or  predicate  sex  offender  as  defined  in subdivision seven of
 section one hundred sixty-eight-a of this  article.  Where  there  is  a
 dispute  between  the  parties  concerning the determinations, the court
 shall adjourn the hearing as necessary to permit the sex offender or the
 district attorney to obtain materials  relevant  to  the  determinations
 from the state board of examiners of sex offenders or any state or local
 facility, hospital, institution, office, agency, department or division.
 Such  materials  may be obtained by subpoena if not voluntarily provided
 to the requesting party. In making the determinations  the  court  shall
 S. 4451  4
 
 review  any  victim's  statement and any relevant materials and evidence
 submitted by the sex offender and the district attorney and  the  recom-
 mendation  and  any  material  submitted  by the board, and may consider
 reliable hearsay evidence submitted by either party, provided that it is
 relevant  to  the determinations. If available, facts proven at trial or
 elicited at the time of a plea of guilty shall be deemed established  by
 clear  and  convincing  evidence and shall not be relitigated. The court
 shall render an order setting forth its determinations and the  findings
 of  fact and conclusions of law on which the determinations are based. A
 copy of the order shall be submitted by the court to the division.  Upon
 application  of  either  party,  the court shall seal any portion of the
 court file or record which contains material that is confidential  under
 any  state  or federal statute. Either party may appeal as of right from
 the order pursuant to the provisions of articles  fifty-five,  fifty-six
 and  fifty-seven  of the civil practice law and rules. Where counsel has
 been assigned to represent the sex offender upon the ground that the sex
 offender is financially unable to retain counsel, that assignment  shall
 be  continued  throughout the pendency of the appeal, and the person may
 appeal as a poor person pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of  the  county
 law.
  §  3.  Subdivision  5  and  the  opening paragraph of subdivision 6 of
 section 168-l of the correction law, subdivision 5 as added  by  chapter
 192  of  the laws of 1995, subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivi-
 sion 5 and the opening paragraph of subdivision 6 as amended by  chapter
 11  of  the laws of 2002, are amended and a new subdivision 5-a is added
 to read as follows:
  5. The board shall develop guidelines and procedures AND USE  A  VALI-
 DATED  RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT to assess the risk of a repeat offense
 by such sex offender and the threat posed to  the  public  safety.  SUCH
 RISK  ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT SHALL BE PERIODICALLY SUBJECTED TO EMPIRICAL
 RE-VALIDATION.  Such  guidelines  shall  [be  based  upon,]  INCORPORATE
 FACTORS  FOUND TO BE PREDICTIVE OF RISK OF RE-OFFENSE, INCLUDING but not
 limited to, the following:
  (a) criminal  history  factors  indicative  of  high  risk  of  repeat
 offense, including:
  (i)  whether  the sex offender has a mental abnormality or personality
 disorder that makes him or her likely to engage  in  predatory  sexually
 violent offenses;
  (ii)  whether the sex offender's conduct was found to be characterized
 by repetitive and compulsive behavior, associated with drugs or alcohol;
  (iii) whether the sex offender served the maximum term;
  (iv) whether the sex offender committed the felony sex offense against
 a child;
  (v) the age of the sex offender at the time of the commission  of  the
 first sex offense;
  (b)  other  criminal  history  factors to be considered in determining
 risk, including:
  (i) the relationship between such sex offender and the victim;
  (ii) whether the offense involved the use of  a  weapon,  violence  or
 infliction of serious bodily injury;
  (iii) the number, date and nature of prior offenses;
  (c)  conditions  of  release  that  minimize  risk [or] OF re-offense,
 including but not limited to whether the sex offender  is  under  super-
 vision;  receiving  counseling,  therapy  or treatment; or residing in a
 home situation that provides guidance and supervision;
 S. 4451  5

  (d) physical conditions that minimize risk  of  re-offense,  including
 but not limited to advanced age or debilitating illness;
  (e)  whether  psychological or psychiatric profiles indicate a risk of
 recidivism;
  (f) the sex offender's response to treatment;
  (g) recent behavior, including behavior while confined;
  (h) recent threats or  gestures  against  persons  or  expressions  of
 intent to commit additional offenses; and
  (i) review of any victim impact statement.
  5-A.  (A)  THE BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIVI-
 SION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES SHALL MAINTAIN A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF
 SEX OFFENDER RECIDIVISM STATISTICS.
  (B) THE BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIVISION  OF
 CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SERVICES SHALL CONDUCT A PERIODIC RETROACTIVE STUDY AT
 LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS TO DETERMINE THE PREDICTIVE  VALUE  OF  THE  RISK
 ASSESSMENT  INSTRUMENT  USED  TO ASSIGN RISK OF REPEAT OFFENSE LEVELS TO
 SEX OFFENDERS PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION SIX OF THIS  SECTION.  AFTER  EACH
 SUCH STUDY THE BOARD SHALL PREPARE A DETAILED REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND
 LEGISLATURE  DETERMINING  THE  PREDICTIVE  VALUE  OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT
 INSTRUMENT AND THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF EACH  FACTOR  CONSIDERED  IN  THE
 OVERALL  RISK  ASSESSMENT  WHEN  APPLIED TO THE STATEWIDE DATABASE MAIN-
 TAINED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION. THE  REPORT  SHALL
 INCLUDE  RECOMMENDED  CHANGES  TO  THE  GUIDELINES  AND  RISK ASSESSMENT
 INSTRUMENT TO ENHANCE THEIR PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES FOR THE  PURPOSE  OF
 PERIODIC  REVALIDATION OF SUCH GUIDELINES AND RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION. THE FIRST SUCH STUDY SHALL
 BE COMPLETED WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  Applying  these  guidelines  AND  THE  VALIDATED  RISK  ASSESSMENT
 INSTRUMENT,  the  board  shall  within  sixty calendar days prior to the
 discharge, parole, release to post-release supervision or release  of  a
 sex offender make a recommendation which shall be confidential and shall
 not  be  available  for public inspection, to the sentencing court as to
 whether such sex offender warrants the designation of  sexual  predator,
 sexually  violent  offender,  or  predicate  sex  offender as defined in
 subdivision seven of section one hundred sixty-eight-a of this  article.
 In  addition, the guidelines AND SUCH INSTRUMENT shall be applied by the
 board to make a recommendation to the sentencing court  which  shall  be
 confidential and shall not be available for public inspection, providing
 for one of the following three levels of notification depending upon the
 degree of the risk of re-offense by the sex offender.
  §  4.  Subdivisions  1  and  2 of section 168-n of the correction law,
 subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 11 of the laws of 2002 and  subdivi-
 sion  2  as  amended  by chapter 453 of the laws of 1999, are amended to
 read as follows:
  1. A determination that an offender is  a  sexual  predator,  sexually
 violent  offender,  or  predicate sex offender as defined in subdivision
 seven of section one hundred sixty-eight-a of this article shall be made
 prior to the discharge, parole, release to post-release  supervision  or
 release of such offender by the sentencing court applying the guidelines
 AND  RISK  ASSESSMENT  INSTRUMENT  established  in  subdivision  five of
 section one hundred sixty-eight-l of  this  article  after  receiving  a
 recommendation  from  the  board  pursuant to section one hundred sixty-
 eight-l of this article.
  2. In addition, applying the guidelines AND RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT
 established in subdivision five of section one hundred sixty-eight-l  of
 this  article, the sentencing court shall also make a determination with
 S. 4451  6
 
 respect to the level of notification, after receiving  a  recommendation
 from  the  board  pursuant  to section one hundred sixty-eight-l of this
 article. Both determinations of the sentencing court shall be made thir-
 ty calendar days prior to discharge, parole or release.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
