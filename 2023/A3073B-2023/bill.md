 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  requiring

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 1238 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 5-d to read as follows:
  5-D. NO PERSON SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS  OF  AGE  SHALL  RIDE  UPON,
 PROPEL  OR OTHERWISE OPERATE A CLASS ONE BICYCLE WITH ELECTRIC ASSIST OR
 A CLASS TWO BICYCLE WITH ELECTRIC ASSIST UNLESS SUCH PERSON IS WEARING A
 HELMET MEETING  STANDARDS  ESTABLISHED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER.  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, WEARING A HELMET MEANS HAVING A PROPERLY
 FITTING HELMET FIXED SECURELY ON THE HEAD OF SUCH WEARER WITH THE HELMET
 STRAPS SECURELY FASTENED.
  § 2. Subdivision 6 of section 1238 of the vehicle and traffic law,  as
 amended  by  section  6 of part XX of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is
 amended to read as follows:
  6. (a) Any person who violates the  provisions  of  subdivision  five,
 five-a, five-b [or], five-c, OR FIVE-D of this section shall pay a civil
 fine not to exceed fifty dollars.
  (b) The court shall waive any fine for which a person who violates the

 proof  that  between  the  date of violation and the appearance date for
 such violation such person purchased or rented a helmet.
  (c)  The  court may waive any fine for which a person who violates the
 provisions of subdivision five, five-a, five-b, [or] five-c,  OR  FIVE-D
 of  this  section would be liable if the court finds that due to reasons
 of economic hardship such person was unable to purchase a helmet or  due
 to such economic hardship such person was unable to obtain a helmet from
 the  statewide in-line skate and bicycle helmet distribution program, as
 established in section two hundred six of the public health  law,  or  a
 local  distribution  program. Such waiver of a fine shall not apply to a
 second or subsequent violation of subdivision five-c of this section.
  § 3. This act shall take effect  on the first of April next succeeding
 the date upon which it shall have become a law.  Effective  immediately,
 the  addition,  amendment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation neces-
 sary for the implementation of  this  act  on  its  effective  date  are
