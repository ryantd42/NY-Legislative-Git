 Introduced by Sens. PARKER, SEPULVEDA -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Aging
 
 AN ACT to amend the elder law, the penal law, the criminal procedure law
  and  the  state  finance  law,  in  relation  to  crime prevention and
  control; and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon  expira-
  tion thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The elder law is amended by adding a new article 4 to  read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 4
  ELDERLY CRIME PREVENTION AND CONTROL TRUST FUND ACT
 SECTION 401. SHORT TITLE.
  402. LEGISLATIVE FINDING AND DECLARATION.
  403. DEFINITIONS.
  404. ADMINISTRATION OF TRUST FUND.
  405. APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
  406. RULES AND REGULATIONS.
  407. REPORTING.
  408. LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS.
  §  401.  SHORT  TITLE. THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS
 THE "ELDERLY CRIME PREVENTION AND CONTROL TRUST FUND ACT".
  § 402. LEGISLATIVE FINDING  AND  DECLARATION.  THIS  LEGISLATURE  DOES
 HEREBY FIND AND DECLARE THAT THE ELDERLY POPULATION OF THIS STATE, WHICH
 FOR  THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE IS DEFINED AS INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE
 OF SIXTY-TWO YEARS, IS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CRIM-
 INAL VICTIMIZATION BY VIRTUE OF PHYSICAL FRAILTY, CONCENTRATIONS IN HIGH
 RISK URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS, AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC HOUSEHOLD FACTORS ADVERTIS-
 ING SENIORS AS HIGH VISIBILITY CRIME TARGETS.  THIS  HEIGHTENED  VULNER-
 ABILITY  ACTS AS A PRECURSOR FOR A GENERALIZED AND DEBILITATING SENSE OF
 FEAR WHICH IMPACTS ON MOBILITY, CONCEPTS OF  SELF-WORTH,  AND  ISOLATION
 FROM THE LARGER SOCIETY. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS AND DECLARES THAT
 ON  THE  BASIS  OF  AVAILABLE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, THE ELDERLY POPU-
 LATION OF THIS STATE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND, THUS  REQUIRING  THAT  THE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
