  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend  the  Retirement  and  Social Security Law to
 provide Tier 1 and Tier 2 members  of  the  New  York  State  and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement  System (NYSLERS) and all members of the New York
 State and Local Police and Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS)  with  a
 presumption  that  any disability or death resulting from impairments of
 health related to Parkinson's Disease are  the  result  of  an  accident
 sustained  in  the performance of duty unless the contrary can be proven
 A. 7871  3
 
 by competent evidence. To be eligible, the member must (1) be  a  volun-
 teer  firefighter  in New York State and have been for at least 5 years,
 (2) have passed a physical examination,  and  (3)  submit  documentation
 verifying these eligibility requirements are satisfied.
  Insofar  as  it  will  affect  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System, if this bill is enacted it would lead to more  disabilities  and
 deaths being classified as "accidental". The cost of the revised benefit
 will  depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan and benefit
 type otherwise payable.
 
 Benefit without  None  Ordinary  POD  Service  Death
 enactment:  Disability  Disability
 
 Cost for revised  10 times  5.5 times  3 times  2 times  13 times
 benefit:  salary  salary  salary  salary  salary
 
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Those costs arising in the NYSLERS and NYSLPFRS will be  shared  by  the
 State  of  New  York  and  the  participating  employers of each system,
 respectively.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be found in the
 2022 Report of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.
  The  actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in the 2020,
 2021, and 2022 Annual Report to the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial  Assump-
 tions,  and  the  Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York:
 Audit and Control.

 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate,  dated  May 31, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No.  2023-56,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Education Law and the
 Retirement and Social Security Law to provide an  accidental  disability
 benefit  to  an eligible active member or an accidental death benefit to
 the beneficiary of an eligible deceased member of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement System who has been a volunteer firefighter in New
 York State for a minimum of five years and  develops  any  condition  of
 impairment of health caused by Parkinson's Disease resulting in total or
 partial  disability  or  death.  Such  impairment  of  health  due  to
 Parkinson's Disease will be considered caused by an accident, not caused
 by such member's own willful negligence, and will be considered to  have
 been incurred in the performance of duty.
  Under current law a disability benefit is generally equal to one-third
 of  final average salary. Ten years of service are required to be eligi-
 A. 7871  4
 
 ble for a disability benefit,  although  this  ten-year  requirement  is
 waived  in  the  case  of  an  accidental disability incurred during the
 performance of duty. The amount of the accidental disability benefit  is
 the same as that of the ordinary disability benefit.
  Under  current  law  the  death  benefit for an active member who dies
 prior to retirement is generally equal to three times the member's  last
 year's  salary,  payable  as a lump sum. The death benefit for an active
 member who dies prior  to  retirement  as  the  result  of  an  accident
 sustained  during the performance of duty is equal to a lifetime benefit
 equal to 50% of the regular salary earned during the member's last  year
 of service.
  The  overall  cost  of  this  bill cannot be readily determined as the
 ultimate number of volunteer firefighter disability retirements or acci-
 dental deaths caused by Parkinson's Disease cannot be determined at this
 time.
  The average cost  per  individual  member  impacted  is  estimated  as
 follows:
 
 Member Age  Disability Benefit  Accidental Death Benefit
  30  $250,000 (4.3 times salary)  $240,000 (4.2 times salary)
  40  $320,000 (4.0 times salary)  $310,000 (3.9 times salary)
  50  $350,000 (3.6 times salary)  $340,000 (3.4 times salary)
 
  The  actual cost per member would be dependent on the member and bene-
 ficiary's age, tier, years of service and salary. The  costs  above  are
 determined  based  on averages, so the actual cost for a member could be
 higher or lower.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.

 tive Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the New York
