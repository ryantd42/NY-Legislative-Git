  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend  the  Retirement  and  Social  Security  Law  to
 provide  Tier  1  and  Tier  2  members  of the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) and all members of the  New  York
 State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) with a
 A. 7871--A  3
 
 presumption that any disability or death resulting from  impairments  of
 health  related  to  Parkinson's  Disease  are the result of an accident
 sustained in the performance of duty unless the contrary can  be  proven
 by  competent  evidence. To be eligible, the member must (1) be a volun-
 teer firefighter in New York State and have been for at least  5  years,
 (2)  have  passed  a  physical examination, and (3) submit documentation
 verifying these eligibility requirements are satisfied.
  Insofar as this bill affects the NYSLERS and NYSLPFRS, if this  legis-
 lation  is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it would lead to
 more disabilities being classified as  "accidental."  The  cost  of  the
 revised  benefit  will depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary,
 plan, and any benefit type otherwise payable but would average:
 
 Benefit prior  Ordinary  Performance  Service
 to enactment:  None  Disability  of Duty  Retirement
 
 Cost for  10 times  5.5 times  3 times  2 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary  salary  salary
 
  Further, we anticipate that there could be some  administrative  costs
 to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this  legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.
 Those  costs  arising  in the NYSLERS and NYSLPFRS will be shared by the
 State of New York  and  the  participating  employers  of  each  system,
 respectively.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.
  The actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in  the  2023
 Annual  Report  to  the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial Assumptions, and the
 Codes, Rules and Regulations  of  the  State  of  New  York:  Audit  and
 Control.
  The Market Assets and GASB Disclosures are found in the March 31, 2023
 New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement System Financial Statements and
 Supplementary Information.
  I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the Quali-
 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 5, 2024, and intended for use  only  during
 the  2024  Legislative  Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-63, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend various sections of the Education  Law  and  the
 Retirement  and  Social Security Law to provide an accidental disability
 benefit to an eligible active member or an accidental death  benefit  to
 the  beneficiary  of  an  eligible deceased member of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System who has been a volunteer firefighter in  New
 York  State  for  a  minimum of five years and develops any condition of
 impairment of health caused by Parkinson's Disease  resulting  in  total
 disability  or  death.  Such  impairment  of health due to Parkinson's
 A. 7871--A  4
 
 Disease will be considered caused by an accident,  not  caused  by  such
 member's  own  willful  negligence,  and will be considered to have been
 incurred in the performance of duty.
  Under current law a disability benefit is generally equal to one-third
 of  final average salary. Ten years of service are required to be eligi-
 ble for a disability benefit,  although  this  ten-year  requirement  is
 waived  in  the  case  of  an  accidental disability incurred during the
 performance of duty. The amount of the accidental disability benefit  is
 the same as that of the ordinary disability benefit.
  Under  current  law  the  death  benefit for an active member who dies
 prior to retirement is generally equal to three times the member's  last
 year's  salary,  payable  as a lump sum. The death benefit for an active
 member who dies prior  to  retirement  as  the  result  of  an  accident
 sustained  during the performance of duty is equal to a lifetime benefit
 equal to 50% of the regular salary earned during the member's last  year
 of service.
  The  overall  cost  of  this  bill cannot be readily determined as the
 ultimate number of volunteer firefighter disability retirements or acci-
 dental deaths caused by Parkinson's Disease cannot be determined at this
 time.
  The average cost  per  individual  member  impacted  is  estimated  as
 follows:
 
 Member  Disability Benefit  Accidental Death Benefit
 Age
 
 30  $250,000 (4.3 times salary)  $240,000 (4.2 times salary)
 40  $320,000 (4.0 times salary)  $310,000 (3.9 times salary)
 50  $360,000 (3.6 times salary)  $350,000 (3.5 times salary)

  The  actual  cost  per member would depend on the member and benefici-
 ary's age, tier, years of service and salary. The costs above are deter-
 mined based on averages, so the actual cost for a member could be higher
 or lower.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can

 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements

 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation

 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024
