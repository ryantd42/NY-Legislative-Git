  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  December 2, 2023, as the Day for  the  Abolition  of
  Slavery in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim December 2, 2023,  as  the
Day  for  the  Abolition  of  Slavery  in  the  State  of  New  York, in
conjunction with the observance of International Day for  the  Abolition
of Slavery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  International  Day for the Abolition of Slavery marks
the date of the adoption, by the General Assembly, of the United Nations
Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic  in  Persons  and  of  the
Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others on December 2, 1949; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The focus of this day is on eradicating contemporary forms
of slavery, such as trafficking in  persons,  sexual  exploitation,  the
worst  forms of child labor, forced marriage, and the forced recruitment
of children for use in armed conflict; and
 
  WHEREAS, Not merely a historical relic, slavery exists all over  the
world;  according  to  the International Labour Organisation (ILO), more
than 40 million people worldwide are victims of modern slavery; although
modern slavery is not defined in law, it is used as  an  umbrella  term;
essentially,  it  refers  to  situations  of  exploitation that a person
cannot  refuse  or  leave  because  of  threats,  violence,  coercion,
deception, and/or abuse of power; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, more than 150 million children are subject to
child labor, accounting for almost one in 10 children around the  world;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  ILO has adopted a new legally binding Protocol designed to
strengthen global efforts to eliminate forced labor, which entered  into
force in November of 2016; journalists have a voice that many workers do
not;  they  can  shine  a  light  on abusive practices and the denial of
fundamental human and labor rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, An estimated 40.3 million people  are  in  modern  slavery,
including  24.9  in  forced  labor  and 15.4 million in forced marriage;
there are 5.4 victims of modern slavery for every 1,000  people  in  the
world; one in four victims of modern slavery are children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Women  and girls are disproportionately affected by forced
labor, accounting for 99  percent  of  victims  in  the  commercial  sex
industry, and 58 percent in other sectors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim December 2, 2023,  as  the
Day  for  the  Abolition  of  Slavery  in  the  State  of  New  York, in
conjunction with the observance of International Day for  the  Abolition
of Slavery; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
