 Introduced  by  Sen. ADDABBO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Racing, Gaming and  Wager-
  ing
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, in
  relation to prohibiting the  use  of  performance-enhancing  drugs  in
  horseracing

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The use of performance-enhancing  drugs
 in  horseracing  threatens the safety and welfare of horses and jockeys,
 creates unfair competition,  deceives  horse  buyers  and  the  wagering
 public.  The  use  of  performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing is not
 permitted in most jurisdictions outside the United  States.  The  United
 States stands alone in its permissive use of performance-enhancing drugs
 and  New York is no exception. In New York State the use of performance-
 enhancing drugs is illegal in every sport other  than  horseracing.  The
 purpose of this legislation is to insure that the use of performance-en-
 hancing drugs in horseraces is prohibited in the State of New York.
  §  2.  The racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law is amended by
 adding a new section 902-a to read as follows:
  § 902-A. PROHIBITIONS ON USE OF PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS. 1.  DEFI-
 NITIONS. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:

  (2)  FROM  AN  ACCREDITATION  BODY  THAT  IS  A  SIGNATORY  TO  THE
