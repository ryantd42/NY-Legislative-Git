  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,

 election form on behalf of her deceased husband with a  joint  allowance
 full  option,  if,  within one year from the effective date of this act,
 she shall submit a request therefor to the state comptroller.  In  addi-
 tion,  his  date  of  retirement shall be deemed to have been August 15,

 pre-retirement ordinary death benefit payable upon the death of a member
 in service pursuant to section 448 of the retirement and social security
 law  shall  be  waived. Any amounts paid by the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system as the result of the  death  of  Robert  C.
 Ritchie  prior  to  the  filing  of the request for a service retirement
 benefit pursuant to this section shall  be  deducted  from  the  service
 retirement benefit payable thereafter.
  §  2.  Any additional costs for this act shall be paid by the state of
 New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

 Gillinder shall be authorized to file for the service retirement benefit
 on  Robert  Ritchie's  behalf  with  a joint allowance full option. Upon
 enactment of this legislation, all rights and benefits to  the  ordinary
 death  benefits  Susan  Gillinder would otherwise be entitled to receive
 shall be waived. Any payments received from such ordinary death  benefit
 will be deducted from the benefits payable under this legislation.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $490,000  which
 will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
