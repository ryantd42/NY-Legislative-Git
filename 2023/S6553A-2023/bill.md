  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Susan Gillinder, the widow of Robert C. Ritchie, who was a member of the
 New York state and local employees' retirement system, who died after he
 filed for retirement but prior to his selected retirement date, shall be
 authorized to file a new service retirement application  and  an  option
 election  form  on behalf of her deceased husband with a joint allowance
 full option, if, within one year from the effective date  of  this  act,
 she  shall  submit a request therefor to the state comptroller. In addi-
 tion, his date of retirement shall be deemed to  have  been  August  15,
 2016.  Once  such application is received, any rights or benefits to the
 pre-retirement ordinary death benefit payable upon the death of a member
 in service pursuant to section 448 of the retirement and social security
 law shall be waived. Any amounts paid by the New York  state  and  local
 employees'  retirement  system  as  the result of the death of Robert C.
 Ritchie prior to the filing of the  request  for  a  service  retirement
 benefit  pursuant  to  this  section  shall be deducted from the service
 retirement benefit payable thereafter.
  § 2. Any additional costs for this act shall be paid by the  state  of
 New York.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  authorize  Susan  Gillinder,  the widow of deceased
 member Robert C. Ritchie, to file a new service  retirement  application
 and option election form on behalf of their deceased spouse with the New
 York State and Local Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS). The date of
 retirement  will  be August 15, 2016, one day prior to the date of death
 of Robert C. Ritchie. The option election  will  be  a  joint  allowance
 full.  Any rights and benefits to an ordinary death benefit payable upon
 the death of Robert C. Ritchie shall be waived. Any such  death  benefit
 paid  by  the  NYSLERS  prior  to the filing of a new service retirement
 application will be deducted from the benefits payable under this legis-
 lation.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  there
 will  be  an immediate past service cost of approximately $496,000 which
 will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
