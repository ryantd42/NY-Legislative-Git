 SPECIFIC  PATIENT  NEED  OR A DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, PROVIDED

 MENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR EACH DRUG OR DEVICE RECEIVED FROM ANY UNREG-
 ISTERED NONRESIDENT ESTABLISHMENT;
  (IV)  ALL  DOCUMENTATION  AND  RECORDS  ARE  RETAINED  AND ARE READILY
 RETRIEVABLE BY THE RESIDENT ESTABLISHMENT FOR A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS;
  (V) THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED BY AN  AUTHORIZED
 FDA  REGISTERED  DRUG  MANUFACTURER  AND  IS NOT A COMPOUNDED DRUG.  THE

 DRUG  OR  DEVICE  SALABLE  ON  PRESCRIPTION ONLY THAT IT RECEIVES FROM A
 MANUFACTURER, A WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR OR A PHARMACY IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH
 THE FEDERAL DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY ACT (DSCSA);
  (VI)  THE  NONRESIDENT  ESTABLISHMENT  FROM  WHICH  THE  DRUG IS BEING
 OBTAINED RECEIVES A REQUEST FOR THE  DRUG  THAT  IDENTIFIES  THE  DRUG'S
 BRAND NAME OR GENERIC NAME, QUALITY, QUANTITY, AND SIZE. SUCH DRUG SHALL
 NOT BE EXPIRED AT THE TIME OF THE EXCHANGE;
  (VII)  THE  DRUG  BEING  OBTAINED INCLUDES WITH THE DRUG A PACKAGING

 UNSEALED, WITH PACKAGE  INSERT,  THE  DRUG'S  NATIONAL  DRUG  CODE,  LOT
 NUMBER,  AND  EXPIRATION DATE CONSPICUOUSLY IDENTIFIED ON THE PACKAGING.
 IF THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER'S PACKAGING IS UNSEALED AT THE TIME OF  THE
 DELIVERY  OR  TRADE, THE DELIVERY OR TRADE MAY INCLUDE A QUANTITY OF THE
 DRUG THAT IS LESS THAN THE QUANTITY CONTAINED IN THE  ORIGINAL  MANUFAC-
 TURER'S  PACKAGING.  HOWEVER, A PHARMACY SHALL NOT TRADE OR DELIVER MORE
 THAN ONE UNSEALED OR PARTIAL QUANTITY OF THE DRUG DURING ANY CONSECUTIVE
 NINETY-DAY PERIOD;
  (VIII)  NOTWITHSTANDING THE LANGUAGE OF THIS SECTION, NOTHING SHALL BE
 INTERPRETED TO ALLOW FOR THE SALE, TRADE OR  EXCHANGE  OF  A  CONTROLLED
 SUBSTANCE  AS  DEFINED BY ARTICLE THIRTY-THREE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW;
 AND
  (IX)  THE SALE/TRANSFER PRICE OF ANY ITEM EXCHANGED UNDER THIS SECTION
 MAY NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE ITEM'S  WHOLESALE  ACQUISITION
 COST (WAC) AT THE TIME OF THE SALE.
  (C)  A  PHARMACY  THAT  RECEIVES  NOTIFICATION  FROM AN UNREGISTERED
 NONRESIDENT ESTABLISHMENT THAT A DELIVERY OR TRADE INVOLVED  A  DRUG  OR
 DEVICE  SALABLE  ON PRESCRIPTION ONLY THAT IS AN ILLEGITIMATE, RECALLED,
 OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT SHALL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE STATE BOARD OF PHAR-
 MACY, AND THE FDA.
  (D)  ANY UNREGISTERED NONRESIDENT ESTABLISHMENT INVOLVED  IN  A  SALE,
 EXCHANGE,  OR TRANSACTION UNDER THIS SECTION IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDIC-
 TION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK REGARDING SAID SALE,  EXCHANGE  OR  TRANS-
 ACTION.  SUCH ESTABLISHMENT SHALL COOPERATE WITH AGENTS OF THE STATE OF
 NEW YORK IF SAID AGENT IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OR INVESTIGATION INTO  THE
 SALE,  EXCHANGE  OR TRANSACTION, AND VIOLATIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE
 PUNISHABLE ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  AND
 THE LAWS OF THIS STATE.
  (E)  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  "SPECIFIC  PATIENT NEED" IS

 PURPOSE  OF INCREASING OR REPLENISHING STOCK IN ANTICIPATION OF A POTEN-
 TIAL NEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY ACT.

 become a law.
