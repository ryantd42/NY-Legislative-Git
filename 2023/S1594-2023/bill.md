  Education
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education law, in relation to the profession of
  nurse anesthesia
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby finds that
 certified registered nurse anesthetists are highly educated and  trained
 advanced practice nurses who hold a national professional certification,
 and whose competency in the professional practice of nurse anesthesia in
 hospitals,  free-standing  ambulatory  surgery centers, clinics, profes-
 sional offices and other facilities is well  known.  Nurse  anesthetists
 are  integral to the continued professional delivery of services in such
 health care facilities throughout the state.
  The legislature further finds  that  statutory  recognition  of  nurse
 anesthetists  will  further  enhance  patient  safety by codifying their
 professional scope of practice that is currently governed in this  state
 by regulations promulgated pursuant to the public health law in the case
 of hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.
  The  legislature also finds that while nurse anesthetists are advanced
 practice nurses, licensed as registered professional nurses under  arti-
 cle  139  of  the  education  law,  no provision of this act is meant to
 limit, diminish or in any way impinge upon the practice of  the  profes-
 sion of nursing as a registered professional nurse under such article.
  Therefore,  the legislature hereby declares that, due to the intrinsic
 nature of the administration of anesthesia services, the  integral  part
 that  certified  registered nurse anesthetists play in the safe delivery
 of such services and the need to protect and enhance patient  safety  in
 all  health care facilities, it is in the interest of the people of this
 state to recognize the national professional certification of registered
