 AN ACT to amend the multiple dwelling law, in relation to rent impairing
  violations;  and  to  amend  the real property actions and proceedings
  law, in relation to eviction proceedings

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  3  of section 302-a of the multiple dwelling
 law, as added by chapter 911 of the laws of 1965, is amended to read  as
 follows:
  3.  a. If (i) the official records of the department shall note that a
 rent impairing violation exists OR EXISTED  in  respect  to  a  multiple
 dwelling and that notice of such violation has been given by the depart-
 ment, by mail, to the owner last registered with the department and (ii)
 such  note  of the violation [is] WAS not cancelled or removed of record
 within [six] THREE  months  after  the  date  of  such  notice  of  such
 violation,  then  for the period that such violation remains uncorrected
 after the expiration of said [six] THREE months, no rent shall be recov-
 ered by any owner for any premises in such multiple dwelling used  by  a
 resident  thereof for human habitation in which the condition constitut-
 ing such rent impairing violation exists, provided, however, that if the
 violation is one that requires approval of plans by the  department  for
 the  corrective  work  and  if plans for such corrective work shall have
 been duly filed within [three months] ONE MONTH from the date of  notice
 of  such  violation  by the department to the owner last registered with
 the department, the [six-months] THREE MONTH period aforementioned shall
 not begin to run until the date that plans for the corrective  work  are
 approved  by  the department; if plans are not filed within said [three-
 months] ONE MONTH period or if so filed, they are disapproved and amend-
 ments are not duly filed within thirty days after the date of  notifica-

 tion of the disapproval by the department to the person having filed the
 plans,  the  [six-months]  THREE MONTH period shall be computed as if no
 plans whatever had been filed under this proviso. If a condition consti-
 tuting  a  rent  impairing  violation  exists  in the part of a multiple
 dwelling used in common by the  residents  or  in  the  part  under  the
 control  of the owner thereof, the violation shall be deemed to exist in
 the respective premises of each resident of the multiple dwelling.
  b. The provisions of subparagraph a shall not apply if (i) the  condi-
 tion referred to in the department's notice to the owner last registered
 with  the department did not in fact exist, notwithstanding the notation
 thereof in the records of the department; (ii) the  condition  which  is
 the subject of the violation has in fact been corrected WITHIN THE THREE
 MONTH  PERIOD REQUIRED BY SUBPARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION, though the
 note thereof in the department has not been removed or cancelled;  (iii)
 the  violation  has been caused by the resident from whom rent is sought
 to be collected or by members of his family  or  by  his  guests  or  by
 another  resident  of the multiple dwelling or the members of the family
 of such other resident or by his guests, or (iv) the resident  proceeded
 against  for  rent  has  refused  entry  to the owner for the purpose of
 correcting the condition giving rise to the violation.
  c. To raise a defense under subparagraph a in any  action  to  recover
 rent or in any special proceeding for the recovery of possession because
 of  non-payment of rent, the resident must affirmatively plead and prove
 the material facts under subparagraph a[, and must also deposit with the
 clerk of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending  at  the
 time  of filing of the resident's answer the amount of rent sought to be
 recovered in  the  action  or  upon  which  the  proceeding  to  recover
 possession  is  based,  to be held by the clerk of the court until final
 disposition of the action or proceeding at which time the rent deposited
 shall be paid to the owner, if the owner prevails, or be returned to the
 resident if the resident prevails. Such deposit of  rent  shall  vitiate
 any  right  on  the  part  of the owner to terminate the lease or rental
 agreement of the resident because of nonpayment of rent].
  d. If a resident voluntarily pays rent or an installment of rent  when
 he OR SHE would be privileged to withhold the same under subparagraph a,
 he  OR  SHE shall [not thereafter] have [any] A claim or cause of action
 to recover back the rent or installment of rent so paid.  A  voluntary
 payment within the meaning hereof shall mean payment other than one made
 pursuant to a judgment in an action or special proceeding.
  e.  [If  upon  the  trial of any action to recover rent or any special
 proceeding for the recovery of possession because of non-payment of rent
 it shall appear that the  resident  has  raised  a  defense  under  this
 section  in  bad faith, or has caused the violation or has refused entry
 to the owner for the purpose of correcting the condition giving rise  to
 the  violation,  the court, in its discretion, may impose upon the resi-
 dent the reasonable costs of the owner, including counsel fees, in main-
 taining the action or proceeding not to exceed one hundred dollars.] THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL NOTIFY THE RESIDENT AND OWNER  WHEN  A  RENT  IMPAIRING
 VIOLATION  HAS  BEEN  PLACED  IN THEIR APARTMENT. THE NOTIFICATION SHALL
 INCLUDE A LIST OF THE RENT IMPAIRING VIOLATIONS PLACED AND  AN  EXPLANA-
 TION OF THE RESIDENT'S RIGHT TO RAISE THE RENT IMPAIRING VIOLATIONS AS A
 DEFENSE  IN  ANY ACTION TO RECOVER RENT OR IN ANY SPECIAL PROCEEDING FOR
 THE RECOVERY OF POSSESSION BECAUSE OF NON-PAYMENT OF RENT.
