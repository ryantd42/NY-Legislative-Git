  law,  the  executive  law  and the legislative law, in relation to the

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent. The legislature finds that procedures
 and practice that promote transparency and accountability in the  execu-
 tive  and  legislative  branches serve the public interest and encourage
 public faith in government. Government  policies  which  allow  for  the
 destruction  of  emails  and  other  electronic governmental records and
 exempt the legislature from the Freedom of Information  Law  (FOIL)  run
 counter to these principles of transparency and accountability.
  Computers  and other electronic devices create many of the new records
 we use today, most commonly via email. These records, although electron-
 ic in format, are the same as records produced in other  formats.  Elec-
 tronic  records  show  how  one  conducts business, makes decisions, and
 carries out the people's  work.  They  are  evidence  of  decisions  and
 actions.  Fundamental  records  management  principles should apply to
 electronic records, as they apply to any record formats.
  The executive branch has adopted a policy allowing automatic  deletion
 of  emails  after 90 days, which has the potential to severely limit the
 public availability of vital information  regarding  the  operations  of
 agencies.  The  consequences  of such a policy are illustrated in a 2015

 judicial proceeding where the former Deputy  Secretary  for  Gaming  and
 Racing  indicated  he  was "aghast" to find that emails dating from 2013
 relevant to the case had been deleted.  The  deletion  of  these  emails
 undermines  the ability of the plaintiff in the case to seek redress. An
 administration spokesman defended deletion of the emails on  the  ground
 they had not been the subject of a FOIL request.
  This  legislation  would  ensure  that under the guidance of the State
 Archives, agencies and legislative bodies must take a proactive approach
 to the preservation of electronic records.  It  would  establish  strict
 standards for permanent preservation of the records of policymakers, and
 prohibit deletion of emails from government officials for at least seven
 years.  It  is modeled on federal policies adopted after extensive study
 of appropriate practices for  handling  electronic  records.  The  state
 already  uses email management software that would enable implementation
 of such a policy at minimal cost.
  Moreover, the exemption of the legislature from presumption of  access
 in  the  Freedom  of  Information  Law  also undermines transparency and
 accountability. The public should have  access  to  the  same  types  of
 information  from  the  legislature  that it can already access from the
 Executive Branch and local government agencies through the FOIL process.
 Recent scandals involving individual legislators only highlight the need
 for increasing the availability  of  information  regarding  legislative
 records.  This  act  would establish the same standards for treating the
 Executive and Legislative branches  under  FOIL.  This  act  would  also
 extend  to the legislature the various exemptions from disclosure in the
 FOIL law, including  records  that  would  compromise  personal  privacy
 rights  or  that  are  related  to internal deliberations of the body or
 agency.
