 reason  of  having  been detained on or in the immediate vicinity of the

 ownership of any merchandise, or (b) a motion picture  theater  for  the
 purposes  of  investigation or questioning as to the unauthorized opera-
 tion of a recording device in a motion picture theater, it  shall  be  a
 defense  to  such  action  that  the person was detained in a reasonable
