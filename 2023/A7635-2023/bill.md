 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 2805-t of the public  health  law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 155 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  § 2805-t. Clinical staffing committees and disclosure of nursing qual-
 ity  indicators. 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares:
  (a) Research demonstrates that nurses play a critical role in  improv-
 ing patient safety and quality of care;
  (b)  Appropriate  staffing  of [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY
 personnel, including  registered  nurses  available  for  patient  care,
 assists  in  reducing  errors,  complications  and  adverse patient care
 events, improves staff safety and satisfaction, and  reduces  incidences
 of workplace injuries;
  (c)  Health  care  professional, technical, and support staff comprise
 vital components of the patient care  team,  bringing  their  particular
 skills and services to ensuring quality patient care;
  (d)  Ensuring  sufficient  staffing  of [general hospital] HEALTH CARE
 FACILITY personnel, including registered nurses,  is  an  urgent  public
 policy  priority  in  order  to  protect  patients  and  support greater
 retention of registered nurses and safer working conditions; and
  (e) It is the public policy of the  state  to  promote  evidence-based
 nurse  staffing  standards and increase transparency of health care data
 and decision making based on the data.
  2. Clinical staffing committee. (a)  Each  general  hospital  licensed
 pursuant  to  this  article,  AND EACH FACILITY OPERATED BY THE STATE, A
 POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OR A PUBLIC  CORPORATION  AS  DEFINED  BY  SECTION

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 SECTION FIVE HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW AND WHICH REQUIRES  THREE
 OR  MORE REGISTERED NURSES, LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSES OR ANCILLARY STAFF
 TO PROVIDE PATIENT SERVICES AT ANY ONE TIME, SHALL CONSTITUTE A  "HEALTH
 CARE  FACILITY"  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THIS SECTION AND SUCH HEALTH CARE
 FACILITIES shall establish and maintain a clinical  staffing  committee,
 either  by  creating  a  new committee or assigning the functions of the
 clinical staffing committee to an  existing  committee,  no  later  than
 January  first, two thousand twenty-two. AN EMPLOYER OPERATING MORE THAN
 ONE FACILITY WITH FEWER THAN THREE REGISTERED NURSES, LICENSED PRACTICAL
 NURSES, OR ANCILLARY STAFF MEMBERS WHO ARE PROVIDING PATIENT SERVICES AT
 ANY ONE TIME SHALL ESTABLISH A REGIONAL STAFFING COMMITTEE IN  A  MANNER
 THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  (b)  Where  a  collective bargaining agreement provides for a staffing
 committee, the required functions of  the  clinical  staffing  committee
 established  pursuant  to  this  section shall be incorporated into that
 committee. Any staffing or  non-staffing  committees  established  by  a
 collective  bargaining  agreement, shall continue to function in accord-
 ance with the terms of the agreement, and the clinical staffing  commit-
 tee  established  by  this section shall not limit or otherwise supplant
 the collective bargaining agreement.
  (c) At least one-half of the members of the clinical staffing  commit-
 tee shall be registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and ancillary
 members  of  the frontline team currently providing or supporting direct
 patient care and up to one-half of the members shall be selected by  the
 [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY administration and shall include
 but  not  be  limited  to the chief financial officer, the chief nursing
 officer, and patient care unit directors or managers or their designees.
 The selection of the registered nurses, licensed practical  nurses,  and
 ancillary  frontline team members of the committee shall be according to
 their respective collective bargaining agreements if  there  is  one  in
 effect at the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY for their bargain-
 ing unit. If there is no applicable collective bargaining agreement, the
 members  of  the  clinical staffing committee who are registered nurses,
 licensed  practical  nurses,  and  ancillary  members  providing  direct
 patient  care shall be selected by their peers. Ancillary members of the
 frontline team on the committee shall include but  are  not  limited  to
 patient  care  technicians,  certified nursing assistants, other non-li-
 censed staff assisting with nursing or clerical tasks, and unit clerks.
  3. Employee participation.  Participation  in  the  clinical  staffing
 committee by a [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY employee shall be
 on  scheduled  work time and compensated at the appropriate rate of pay.
 Clinical staffing committee members shall be fully relieved of all other
 work duties during meetings of the committee and  shall  not  have  work
 duties  added or displaced to other times as a result of their committee
 responsibilities.
  4. Primary responsibilities. Primary responsibilities of the  clinical
 staffing committee shall include the following functions:
  (a)  Development and oversight of implementation of an annual clinical
 staffing plan. The clinical staffing plan shall include specific  staff-
 ing  for each patient care unit and work shift and shall be based on the
 needs of patients. Staffing plans shall include specific  guidelines  or
 ratios,  matrices, or grids indicating how many patients are assigned to
 each registered nurse and the number of nurses and ancillary staff to be
 A. 7635  3
 
 present on each unit and shift and shall be used as the  primary  compo-
 nent of the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY staffing budget.
  (b)  Factors  to  be considered and incorporated in the development of
 the plan shall include, but are not limited to:
  (i) Census, including total numbers of patients on the  unit  on  each
 shift  and  activity  such as patient discharges, admissions, and trans-
 fers;
  (ii) Measures of acuity and intensity of all patients  and  nature  of
 the care to be delivered on each unit and shift;
  (iii) Skill mix;
  (iv)  The  availability,  level  of  experience, and specialty certif-
 ication or training of nursing personnel providing patient care, includ-
 ing charge nurses, on each unit and shift;
  (v) The need for specialized or intensive equipment;
  (vi) The architecture and geography of the patient care unit,  includ-
 ing  but  not  limited  to  placement of patient rooms, treatment areas,

  (vii) Mechanisms and procedures  to  provide  for  one-to-one  patient
 observation,  when needed, for patients on psychiatric or other units as
 appropriate;
  (viii) Other special characteristics of the unit or community  patient
 population,  including age, cultural and linguistic diversity and needs,

 jurisdictions,  national  nursing  professional  associations, specialty
 nursing organizations, and other health professional organizations;
  (xi) Availability of other personnel supporting  nursing  services  on

 es,  and ancillary staff to take meal and rest breaks, planned time off,
 and unplanned absences that are reasonably foreseeable  as  required  by
 law  or  the  terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, if
 any, between the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY and a represen-
 tative of the nursing or ancillary staff;
  (xiv) The nursing quality indicators required under subdivision seven-
 teen of this section;
  (xv) [General hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY finances  and  resources;
 and
  (xvi)  Provisions for limited short-term adjustments made by appropri-
 ate [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY personnel overseeing patient
 care operations to the staffing levels required by the  plan,  necessary
 to  account  for  unexpected  changes in circumstances that are to be of
 limited duration.
  (c) Semiannual review of the staffing plan against patient  needs  and
 known  evidence-based staffing information, including the nursing sensi-
 tive quality indicators collected by the [general hospital] HEALTH  CARE
 FACILITY.
  (d) Review, assessment, and response to complaints regarding potential
 violations  of  the adopted staffing plan, staffing variations, or other
 concerns regarding the implementation of the staffing  plan  and  within

 A. 7635  4
 
  5.  Compliance provisions. (a) The clinical staffing plan shall comply
 with all federal and state laws and regulations and shall  not  diminish
 other  standards  contained  in state or federal law and regulations, or
 the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, if any.
  (b)  The  clinical staffing plan shall comply with applicable laws and
 regulations, including, but not limited to:
  (i) Regulations made by the department on burn  unit  staffing,  liver
 transplant staffing, and operating room circulating nurse staffing;
  (ii) Staffing regulations to be promulgated by the commissioner relat-
 ing  to staffing in intensive care and critical care units no later than
 January first, two thousand twenty-two. Such regulations shall  consider
 the  factors  set  forth  in  paragraph  (b) of subdivision four of this
 section, standards in place in neighboring states, and a minimum  stand-
 ard of twelve hours of registered nurse care per patient per day;
  (iii) Such other staffing standards or regulations as are currently in
 effect  or  may hereafter be established by the department or enacted by
 the legislature; and
  (iv) The provisions of section one hundred sixty-seven  of  the  labor
 law and any related regulations.
  (c)  The  clinical staffing plan shall comply with and incorporate any
 minimum staffing  levels  provided  for  in  any  applicable  collective
 bargaining  agreement,  including  but  not  limited to nurse-to-patient
 ratios, caregiver-to-patient ratios, staffing grids, staffing  matrices,
 or other staffing provisions.
  6.  Process  for adoption of clinical staffing plans. (a) The clinical
 staffing committee shall produce the [general  hospital's]  HEALTH  CARE
 FACILITY'S annual clinical staffing plan by July first of each year.
  (b)  Clinical staffing plans shall be developed and adopted by consen-
 sus of the clinical staffing committee. For the purposes of  determining
 whether  there  is  a consensus, the management members of the committee
 shall have one vote and the employee members of the committee shall have
 one vote, regardless of the actual number of members of  the  committee.
 Each  side may determine its own method of casting its vote to adopt all
 or part of the clinical staffing plan.
  (c) The [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY shall adopt any  clin-
 ical  staffing plan that is wholly or partially recommended by a consen-
 sus of the clinical staffing committee. If there is no consensus on  the
 recommended staffing plan or any of its parts, the chief executive offi-
 cer  of  the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY shall use the offi-
 cer's discretion to adopt a plan or partial plan for which there  is  no
 consensus.  In  this  case,  the chief executive officer shall provide a
 written explanation of the elements of the clinical staffing  plan  that
 the  committee  was  unable  to  agree  on,  including the final written
 proposals from the two parties and their rationales. In no event  may  a
 chief executive officer fail to include in the adopted plan any staffing
 related  terms  and  conditions  of  the  plan  that has previously been
 adopted  through  any  applicable  collective  bargaining  agreement.
 PROVIDED,  FURTHER, HOWEVER, WHEN A STAFFING PLAN IS ADOPTED IN WHOLE OR
 IN PART BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DUE TO A LACK OF CONSENSUS BY THE
 CLINICAL STAFFING COMMITTEE, SUCH PLAN OR PORTION THEREOF  SHALL  BE  IN
 EFFECT  FOR  ONE  HUNDRED  AND EIGHTY DAYS AFTER WHICH TIME SUCH PLAN OR
 PORTION THEREOF SHALL BE REFERRED BACK TO THE CLINICAL STAFFING  COMMIT-
 TEE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
 OFFICER  IN  THE  SAME  MANNER  AS  PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS
 SECTION.  IF THE CLINICAL STAFFING COMMITTEE FAILS TO REACH CONSENSUS ON
 A CLINICAL STAFFING PLAN IN  WHOLE  OR  IN  PART  AFTER  TWO  SUCCESSIVE
 A. 7635  5
 
 ATTEMPTS OR WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER INITIAL ADOPTION OF A STAFFING PLAN BY
 THE  CHIEF  EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
 CLINICAL STAFFING  COMMITTEE  REPRESENTING  NURSES,  LICENSED  PRACTICAL
 NURSES  AND ANCILLARY STAFF MEMBERS SHALL BE ADOPTED IN WHOLE OR IN PART
 FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER WHICH TIME SUCH CLINICAL STAFFING PLAN
 OR PART THEREOF SHALL BE REFERRED BACK TO THE CLINICAL STAFFING  COMMIT-
 TEE  FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE SAME MANNER AS
 PROVIDE FOR IN SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION.
  (d) Each [general hospital]  HEALTH  CARE  FACILITY  shall  adopt  and
 submit  its first [hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY clinical staffing plan
 under this section to the department no later than July first, two thou-
 sand twenty-two and annually  thereafter.  The  plan  submitted  to  the
 department shall, where applicable, include the written explanation from
 the  chief  executive officer and written proposals from the two parties
 regarding elements that the committee did not agree on  as  required  in
 paragraph  (c) of this subdivision. The submitted clinical staffing plan
 shall include data, from at least the previous year,  on  the  frequency
 and  duration of variations from the adopted clinical staffing plan, the
 number of complaints relating to the clinical staffing  plan  and  their
 disposition,  as well as descriptions of unresolved complaints submitted
 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision  seven  of  this  section.  The
 department  shall  post  the  plan  as  part of each individual [general
 hospital's] HEALTH CARE FACILITY'S health profile on the website of  the
 department, IF APPLICABLE, no later than July thirty-first of each year.
 If  the  adopted  clinical  staffing  plan  is subsequently amended, the
 amended plan shall be submitted to the department within thirty days  of
 adoption.  Adopted  staffing  plans  shall  be  amended to include newly
 created units and existing units that undergo clinical  or  programmatic
 changes  that fundamentally alter their character or nature. The depart-
 ment shall post amended staffing plans upon receipt.
  7. Implementation of clinical staffing plans.  (a)  Beginning  January
 first, two thousand twenty-three, and annually thereafter, each [general
 hospital]  HEALTH  CARE  FACILITY  shall implement the clinical staffing
 plan adopted by July first of the prior calendar year,  and  any  subse-
 quent  amendments,  and  assign  personnel  to each patient care unit in
 accordance with the plan.
  (b) A registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, ancillary member  of
 the  frontline  team, or collective bargaining representative may report
 to the clinical staffing committee any variations  where  the  personnel
 assignment  in a patient care unit is not in accordance with the adopted
 staffing plan and may make a complaint to the  committee  based  on  the
 variations.
  (c)  The  clinical staffing committee shall develop a process to exam-
 ine, respond to, and track data submitted under paragraph  (b)  of  this
 subdivision.  The  clinical  staffing  committee  may  by  consensus, as
 described in paragraph (b) of subdivision six of this section, determine
 a complaint resolved or dismissed. The clinical staffing committee shall
 also establish agreed upon rules and criteria to provide  for  confiden-
 tiality  of  complaints that are in the process of being examined or are
 found to be unsubstantiated. This subdivision does not infringe upon  or
 limit  the rights of any collective bargaining representative of employ-
 ees, or of any employee or group of  employees  pursuant  to  applicable
 law,  including without limitation any applicable state or federal labor
 laws.
  8. Posting of staffing information.  Each  [general  hospital]  HEALTH
 CARE FACILITY shall post, in a publicly conspicuous area on each patient
 A. 7635  6
 
 care unit, the clinical staffing plan for that unit and the actual daily
 staffing  for  that  shift on that unit as well as the relevant clinical
 staffing.
  9.  Retaliation  and  intimidation  prohibited.  A  [general hospital]
 HEALTH CARE FACILITY shall not retaliate against or engage in  any  form
 of intimidation of:
  (a)  An  employee  for  performing  any  duties or responsibilities in
 connection with the clinical staffing committee; or
  (b) An employee, patient, or other individual who notifies  the  clin-
 ical  staffing committee or the [hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY adminis-
 tration of the individual's staffing concerns.
  10. Special considerations. Nothing in this  section  is  intended  to
 create unreasonable burdens on critical access hospitals under 42 U.S.C.
 Sec.  1395i-4  and  sole  community  hospitals  under  42  U.S.C.  Sec.
 1395ww(d)(5) related to the operation of their clinical staffing commit-
 tees. Critical access and sole community hospitals may develop  flexible
 approaches  to  accomplish  the  requirements of this section.  Clinical
 staffing plans from such entities  submitted  to  the  department  shall
 contain  a  description  of  any  ways  in  which the general hospital's
 approach to creating the plan differed from the process outlined in this
 section. This subdivision does not relieve such entities from compliance
 with other provisions of this section related to the adoption, implemen-
 tation and adherence to an adopted clinical staffing plan, reporting and
 disclosure, or other requirements of this section.
  11. Investigations. (a) The  department  shall  investigate  potential
 violations  of  this  section  following  receipt  of  a  complaint with
 supporting evidence, of failure to:
  (i) Form or establish a clinical staffing committee;
  (ii) Comply with the requirements of this section in creating a  clin-
 ical staffing plan;
  (iii)  Adopt  all or part of a clinical staffing plan that is approved
 by consensus of the clinical staffing committee  and  submitted  to  the
 department;
  (iv) Conduct a semiannual review of a clinical staffing plan; or
  (v)  Submit  to  the  department a clinical staffing plan on an annual
 basis and any updates.
  (b) The department  shall  initiate  an  investigation  of  unresolved
 complaints,  that  have  first  been  submitted to the clinical staffing
 committee, regarding compliance with the clinical staffing plan, person-
 nel assignments in a patient care unit or staffing levels, or any  other
 requirement  of the adopted clinical staffing plan, excluding complaints
 determined  by  the  clinical  staffing  committee  to  be  resolved  or
 dismissed  as determined by consensus of the clinical staffing committee
 as described in paragraph (b) of subdivision six of this section.
  (c) The department shall initiate an  investigation  after  making  an
 assessment  that  there  is  a  pattern of failure to resolve complaints
 submitted to the clinical staffing committee or a pattern of failure  to
 reach  consensus  on  the adoption of all or part of a clinical staffing
 plan. In the case of a pattern of failure to resolve  complaints  or  to
 reach  consensus  on  the adoption of all or part of a clinical staffing
 plan, the department shall determine if the pattern was due  to  one  of
 the parties routinely refusing to resolve complaints or reach consensus.
  (d) Any department investigation of a complaint under this subdivision
 shall  consider whether unforeseeable emergency circumstances as defined
 in subdivision fourteen of this section contributed to  the  failure  of
 the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY to comply with this section.
 A. 7635  7
 
  (e)  After  an  investigation  conducted under paragraph (a) or (b) of
 this subdivision, if the department determines that  there  has  been  a
 violation,  the  department  shall require the [general hospital] HEALTH
 CARE FACILITY to submit a corrective plan of  action  within  forty-five
 days  of the presentation of findings from the department to the [hospi-
 tal] HEALTH CARE FACILITY. If the department determines  after  investi-
 gation under paragraph (c) of this subdivision that the general hospital
 representatives  on the clinical staffing committee were responsible for
 a pattern of not resolving complaints or for a pattern of  not  reaching
 consensus, the department shall require the general hospital to submit a
 corrective  action  plan  within  forty-five days of the presentation of
 findings to the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY.  If the depart-
 ment finds that the frontline  staff  representatives  on  the  clinical
 staffing  committee  were  responsible  for  a  pattern of not resolving
 complaints or for a pattern of not reaching  consensus,  the  department
 shall  not require the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY to submit
 a corrective action plan or impose  a  civil  penalty  on  the  [general
 hospital]  HEALTH  CARE  FACILITY pursuant to subdivision twelve of this
 section.
  12. Civil penalties. In the event that  a  [general  hospital]  HEALTH
 CARE  FACILITY  fails  to  submit  or  submits  but fails to implement a
 corrective action plan in response to a violation or violations found by
 the department based on a complaint filed pursuant to paragraph (a), (b)
 or (c) of subdivision eleven of this section, the department may  impose
 a  civil penalty as authorized by section twelve of this chapter for all
 violations asserted against the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY,
 until the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY submits or  implements
 a  corrective  action plan or takes other action directed by the depart-
 ment.
  13. Posting of penalties and related information. The department shall
 maintain for public inspection, including posting on the general  hospi-
 tal  profile  on the department website, records of any civil penalties,
 administrative actions, or license suspensions or revocations imposed on
 [general hospitals] HEALTH CARE FACILITIES under this section.
  14. Unforeseeable emergency circumstances. (a) For  purposes  of  this
 section, "unforeseeable emergency circumstance" means:
  (i) Any officially declared national, state, or municipal emergency;
  (ii)  When  a [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY disaster plan is
 activated; or
  (iii) Any unforeseen disaster or other catastrophic event  that  imme-
 diately affects or increases the need for health care services.
  (b)  In  determining whether a [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY
 has violated its obligations under  this  section  to  comply  with  the
 [general  hospital's]  HEALTH CARE FACILITY'S clinical staffing plan, it
 shall not be a defense that it was unable to secure sufficient staff  if
 the  lack of staffing was foreseeable and could be prudently planned for
 or involved routine nurse staffing  needs  that  arose  due  to  typical
 staffing patterns, typical levels of absenteeism, and time off typically
 approved  by  the  employer  for  vacation,  holidays,  sick  leave, and
 personal leave.
  15. Complaints. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude
 the ability to submit a complaint to  the  department  as  provided  for
 under  this  chapter.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall be construed as
 supplanting other complaint mechanisms established by a [general  hospi-
 tal]  HEALTH  CARE  FACILITY,  including  mechanisms  designed to aid in
 compliance with other federal, state or  local  laws.  Nothing  in  this
 A. 7635  8
 
 section  shall  be  construed  as  limiting or supplanting the rights of
 employees and  their  collective  bargaining  representatives  to  fully
 enforce  any  and  all rights under the terms of a collective bargaining
 agreement.  An  employer  shall  not assert or attempt to assert a claim
 that enforcement of the collective bargaining  agreement  is  barred  or
 limited by any provisions of this section.
  16. Annual report. (a) The department shall submit an annual report to
 the  speaker of the assembly, the temporary president of the senate, and
 the chairs of the health committees of the assembly and senate  and  the
 governor  on  or  before December thirty-first of each year. This report
 shall include the number of complaints submitted to the department,  the
 disposition of these complaints, the number of investigations conducted,
 and the associated costs for complaint investigations, if any.
  (b)  Prior  to  the  submission  of the report, the commissioner shall
 convene a stakeholder workgroup consisting  of  [hospital]  HEALTH  CARE
 FACILITY associations and unions representing nurses and other ancillary
 members  of  the  frontline team. The stakeholder workgroup shall review
 the report prior to its submission to the speaker of the  assembly,  the
 temporary  president of the senate, and the chairs of the health commit-
 tees of the assembly and senate.
  17. Disclosure of nursing quality indicators. (a) Every facility  with
 an  operating  certificate  pursuant to the requirements of this article
 shall make available to the public information regarding nurse  staffing
 and  patient outcomes as specified by the commissioner by rule and regu-
 lation. The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations  on  the
 disclosure of nursing quality indicators providing for the disclosure of
 information  including  at  least  the  following, as appropriate to the
 reporting facility:
  (i) The number of registered nurses  providing  direct  care  and  the
 ratio  of patients per registered nurse, full-time equivalent, providing
 direct care. This information shall be expressed in actual  numbers,  in
 terms  of  total hours of nursing care per patient, including adjustment
 for case mix and acuity, and as a percentage of patient care staff,  and
 shall  be  broken  down  in  terms of the total patient care staff, each
 unit, and each shift.
  (ii) The number of licensed practical nurses  providing  direct  care.
 This information shall be expressed in actual numbers, in terms of total
 hours  of nursing care per patient including adjustment for case mix and
 acuity, and as a percentage of patient care staff, and shall  be  broken
 down  in  terms  of  the  total  patient care staff, each unit, and each
 shift.
  (iii) The number of unlicensed personnel utilized  to  provide  direct
 patient  care, including adjustment for case mix and acuity. This infor-
 mation shall be expressed both in actual numbers and as a percentage  of
 patient  care  staff  and  shall  be  broken  down in terms of the total
 patient care staff, each unit, and each shift.
  (iv) Incidence of adverse patient care, including  incidents  such  as
 medication  errors,  patient  injury,  decubitus  ulcers,  nosocomial
 infections, and nosocomial urinary tract infections.
  (v) Methods used for determining and  adjusting  staffing  levels  and
 patient care needs and the facility's compliance with these methods.
  (vi) Data regarding complaints filed with any state or federal regula-
 tory agency, or an accrediting agency, and data regarding investigations
 and  findings as a result of those complaints, degree of compliance with
 acceptable standards, and the findings of scheduled inspection visits.
 A. 7635  9
 
  (b) Such information shall be provided  to  the  commissioner  of  any
 state  agency  responsible for licensing or accrediting the facility, or
 responsible for overseeing the delivery of services either  directly  or
 indirectly, to any employee of a [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY
 or the employee's collective bargaining agent, if any, and to any member
 of  the public who requests such information directly from the facility.
 Written statements containing such information shall  state  the  source
 and date thereof.
  (c)  The  commissioner  shall  make  regulations  to provide a uniform
 format or form for complying with the reporting requirements of subpara-
 graphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision,  allow-
 ing  patients  and the public to clearly understand and compare staffing
 patterns and actual levels of staffing across facilities.  Such  uniform
 format  or form shall allow facilities to include a description of addi-
 tional resources available to support unit  level  patient  care  and  a
 description of the [general hospital] HEALTH CARE FACILITY. The informa-
 tion  required  by subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) of
 this subdivision, reported in a manner determined by  the  commissioner,
 shall  be  filed with the department electronically on a quarterly basis
 and shall be available to the public on the  department's  website.  The
 regulations  shall  take effect no later than December thirty-first, two
 thousand twenty-two. Information required to  be  provided  pursuant  to
 subparagraphs  (i),  (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision
 shall be made available to the public no  later  than  July  first,  two
 thousand twenty-three.
  18.  Advisory commission. (a) There is hereby established an independ-
 ent advisory commission, composed of nine experts in staffing  standards
 and  quality  of patient care, including: three experts in nursing prac-
 tice, quality of nursing care or patient care  standards,  one  of  whom
 shall  be  appointed  by the governor, one of whom shall be appointed by
 the speaker of the assembly and one of whom shall be  appointed  by  the
 temporary  president  of  the  senate;  three  representatives of unions
 representing nurses, one of whom shall be appointed by the governor, one
 of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the  assembly  and  one  of
 whom  shall  be  appointed by the temporary president of the senate; and
 three members representing [general hospitals] HEALTH  CARE  FACILITIES,
 one  of  whom  shall  be appointed by the governor, one of whom shall be
 appointed by the speaker of the  assembly  and  one  of  whom  shall  be
 appointed  by  the temporary president of the senate. The members of the
 commission shall serve at  the  pleasure  of  the  appointing  official.
 Members  of  the  commission  shall  keep  confidential  any information
 received in the course of their duties and may only use such information
 in the course of carrying out their duties  on  the  commission,  except
 those  reports  required  to  be  issued  by  the  commission under this
 section, which may only include de-identified information.
  (b) The advisory commission shall convene from time to time  in  order
 to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  clinical  staffing committees
 required by this section.  Such  review  shall  evaluate  the  following
 metrics,  including but not limited to quantitative and qualitative data
 on whether staffing levels were improved and maintained, patient  satis-
 faction,  employee  satisfaction, patient quality of care metrics, work-
 place safety, and any other metrics the commission deems relevant.  The
 commission  shall also review the annual report submitted by the depart-
 ment and make recommendations to the speaker of the assembly, the tempo-
 rary president of the senate, and the chairs of the health committees of
 A. 7635  10
