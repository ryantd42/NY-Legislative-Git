 SURE.
  (B) SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION,  IF  A CONNECTED DEVICE IS EQUIPPED WITH A MEANS FOR AUTHENTICA-
 TION OUTSIDE A LOCAL AREA NETWORK, IT SHALL BE DEEMED A REASONABLE SECU-

 SHALL  NOT  BE  CONSTRUED  TO RELIEVE ANY PARTY FROM ANY DUTIES OR OBLI-
 GATIONS IMPOSED UNDER ANY OTHER LAW.
  (G) THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE  AUTHORITY  OF  A
 LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY  TO  OBTAIN CONNECTED DEVICE INFORMATION FROM A
 MANUFACTURER AS AUTHORIZED BY LAW OR PURSUANT TO AN ORDER OF A COURT  OF
 COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
