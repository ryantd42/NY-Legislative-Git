  COMMENDING  The  Campaign  Against Hunger upon the
  occasion of hosting its 12th Annual  Planter  Awards
  Gala,  and paying tribute to this year's honorees on
  May 3, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the communities of New  York  State
are  reflective  of the concerned and dedicated efforts of organizations
and individuals who devote themselves to the welfare  of  the  community
and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  The  Campaign  Against  Hunger upon the occasion of hosting its
12th Annual Planter Awards Gala, and  to  pay  tribute  to  this  year's
honorees  on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, at Giando on the Water in Brooklyn,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year's honorees are Kate MacKenzie, Executive Director
of the Mayor's Office of Food Policy; Noreen Springstead, President  and
CEO  of  Partnership  for  a  Healthier  America;  and Karen Washington,
Co-Owner of Rise & Root Farm and Co-Founder, Black Urban Growers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Campaign Against Hunger was founded  in  1998,  by  Dr.
Melony  Samuels  to  empower  its  neighbors  to  lead  healthier,  more
productive, and self-sufficient lives  by  increasing  access  to  safe,
nutritious food and related resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since its inception, The Campaign Against Hunger has grown
from its humble beginnings operating out of a small pantry in  a  church
basement to meeting some of the day's toughest challenges, such as youth
empowerment,  nutrition  education,  and  community  engagement-head-on
through its SuperPantry; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Campaign Against Hunger has also  served  neighbors  in
150  zip  codes  with  food  and  other vital programs and services, and
sought to bring food justice to New York City along the way; and
 
  WHEREAS, The SuperPantry offers its clients  hundreds  of  nutrition
education  classes, workshops, and cooking demonstrations each year, and
its urban farms and the Green Teens who maintain them have continued  to
infuse heart-healthy fruits and vegetables into food deserts and provide
gainful employment to local youth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, this remarkable organization offers a variety
of  social  services,  including  SNAP  registration,  health  insurance
enrollment, and tax filing preparation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, under the luminous leadership of Dr. Melony Samuels,
The  Campaign  Against  Hunger  continues  to evolve as food insecurity,
economic inequality, and  health  disparities  continue  to  plague  our
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  The Campaign Against Hunger is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its Board of Directors  and  staff,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  institution and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  and  individuals  who have faithfully served the needs of
their community with diligence and compassionate commitment to improving
the quality and dignity of life in the  community  are  brought  to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  The  Campaign  Against  Hunger upon the occasion of hosting its
12th Annual Planter Awards Gala, and  to  pay  tribute  to  this  year's
honorees on May 3, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Dr. Melony Samuels,  CEO/Founder,  The  Campaign  Against
Hunger, and the aforementioned honorees.
