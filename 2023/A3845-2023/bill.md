 AN  ACT to amend the uniform justice court act, in relation to the mone-
  tary jurisdiction of justice courts
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivision a of section 201 of the uniform justice court
 act, as amended by chapter 685 of the laws of 1977, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  a.  The court shall have jurisdiction as set forth in this article and
 as elsewhere provided by law, subject, in  the  case  of  a  city  court
 governed by this act, to the limitations stated in § 2300 (b) (2) (i) of
 this  act.  The  phrase  "[$3000]  $15,000", whenever it appears herein,
 shall be taken to  mean  "[$3000]  $15,000  exclusive  of  interest  and
 costs",  except  that,  in the case of a city court governed by this act
 whose monetary jurisdiction is, pursuant to § 2300 (b) (2) (i)  of  this
 act, below [$3000] $15,000, it shall be taken to mean such lesser sum as
 is applicable in the particular court, exclusive of interest and costs.
  § 2. Section 202 of the uniform justice court act, as amended by chap-
 ter 685 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
 § 202. Money actions and actions to recover chattels.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the court shall have
 jurisdiction of actions and proceedings for the  recovery  of  money  or
 chattels  where  the  amount  sought to be recovered or the value of the
 property does not exceed [$3000] $15,000.
  § 3. Section 208 of the uniform justice court act, as amended by chap-
 ter 685 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
 § 208. Counterclaims.
  The Court shall have jurisdiction of any  counterclaim  whose  subject
 matter  would  be  within its jurisdiction if sued upon separately. If a
 counterclaim for money only in excess of [$3000] $15,000 is  interposed,

 the court may entertain it to the extent of [$3000] $15,000 but it shall
 be deemed waived as to the excess above [$3000] $15,000.
  § 4. Section 211 of the uniform justice court act, as amended by chap-
 ter 685 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
 § 211. Joinder of causes of action in complaint; effect on jurisdiction.
  Where several causes of action are asserted in the complaint, and each
 of them would be within the jurisdiction of the court if sued upon sepa-
 rately,  the  court  shall have jurisdiction of the action. In such case
 judgment may be rendered by the court in excess of  [$3000]  $15,000  if
 such excess result solely because of such joinder.
  §  5.  Section  1801  of  the uniform justice court act, as amended by
 chapter 485 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
 § 1801. Small claims defined.
  The term "small claim" or "small claims" as used  in  this  act  shall
 mean  and  include  any  cause of action for money only not in excess of
 [three] FIFTEEN  thousand  dollars  exclusive  of  interest  and  costs,
 provided  that  the  defendant  either resides, or has an office for the
 transaction of business or a regular employment within the  municipality
 where  the  court  is  located,  or where claimant is or was a tenant or
 lessee of real property owned by the defendant and the claim relates  to
 such  tenancy  or  lease,  and such real property is situated within the
 municipality where the court is located. However, where a judge  of  the
 county court, pursuant to subdivision (g) of section three hundred twen-
 ty-five  of  the  civil  practice law and rules, transfers a small claim
 from the town or village court having jurisdiction over  the  matter  to
 another town or village court within the same county, the court to which
 it is transferred shall have jurisdiction to determine the claim.
  §  6.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
