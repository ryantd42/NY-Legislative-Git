 Introduced by M. of A. DiPIETRO -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Health
 
 AN  ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to a vaccine bill of
  rights to protect  New  York  citizens  against  unconstitutional  and
  medically irresponsible COVID-19 vaccine mandates; to amend the educa-
  tion  law and the public health law, in relation to medical exemptions
  from vaccination requirements; to amend the labor law, in relation  to
  limiting the civil liability of employers and employees for the spread
  or  possible  transmission  of  COVID-19  caused by an act or omission
  while acting in good faith; to amend  the  public  health  law,  in
  relation  to  prohibiting  a  mandatory immunization against the novel
  coronavirus/COVID-19; and to amend the public health law, in  relation
  to  exempting  private and parochial schools and day care centers from
  immunization requirements
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The Founders designated that a Bill
 of Rights was necessary to guard individual  liberty  against  encroach-
 ments from state and federal actors, public and private. The 14th Amend-
 ment  to the U.S. Constitution explicitly directs states not to "deprive
 any person of life, liberty, or property, without due  process  of  law;
 nor  deny  to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
 the laws". No COVID vaccine is  FDA-approved  but  some  are  authorized
 under  a temporary Emergency Use Authorization as experimental (investi-
 gational) agents. Emergency use products are specifically prohibited  by
 federal  law 21 U.S.C. §360bbb-3 from being mandated: "Authorization for
 medical products for use in emergencies ... require ...  the  option  to
 accept  or  refuse  administration  of  the  product".  The CDC Advisory
 Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) affirmed in August 2020  that
 under  an  Emergency  Use Authorization (EUA), experimental vaccines are
 not allowed to be mandatory. Decades-old universally accepted  Codes  of
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 Medical  Ethics,  including  the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of
 Helsinki absolutely prohibits any form of coercion whatsoever  to  indi-
 viduals  to  participate in a medical experiment. 40 percent of respond-
 ents  in at least one US poll reported that they would opt out of taking
 experimental COVID vaccines. It is neither feasible nor safe to  mandate
 experimental  vaccination  given  the large number of COVID-19 recovered
 patients in the general population and the FDA/Pfizer/ Moderna protocols
 which excluded COVID-19 recovered patients. It is neither  feasible  nor
 safe  to  administer  experimental  vaccines to many groups of patients,
 such as persons with post-natural infections,  waning  titers,  allergic
 reactions,  as  well  as childbearing women. Public and private measures
 are nonetheless being considered to mandate experimental vaccinations in
 order to participate in certain public activities and functions of daily
 American life, including  but  not  limited  to:  employment,  in-person
 school  attendance,  public  transportation,  and  concert performances.
 "Vaccine passports," "digital  health  IDs,"  and  other  such  required
 documentation  pose  substantial  risks  to  personal  privacy and equal
 treatment before the law for all citizens of New York  as  well  as  the
 United  States  generally.  Administration of the experimental COVID-19
 vaccines according to  guidelines  established  by  the  CDC's  Advisory
 Committee  on Immunization Practices do not provide adequate protections
 for average Americans concerned about potential health  hazards  associ-
 ated  with the inoculations. The public is entitled to receive unbiased,
 transparent,  easily  accessible  medical  information  related  to  all
 vaccines  from  their  public  health  officials. The doctors and nurses
 administering the inoculation are  required  by  law  to  give  informed
 consent  and  they  cannot  do that if they themselves are not informed.
 The emergency powers assumed by the chief executives of  certain  states
 as  well as municipal leaders violate certain unalienable rights guaran-
 teed under the U.S. Constitution and its and Bill of Rights  and  there-
 fore  deserve  redress. While these legitimate grievances are pursued by
 the courts of various states,  state  lawmakers  must  enshrine  certain
 rights  against encroachment by decrees that are not medically or scien-
 tifically indicated, such as vaccine mandates, in order  to  ensure  the
 continuity  of  these rights. A COVID-19 Vaccine Bill of Rights  against
 COVID-19 vaccine mandates provides an  example  of  adoption  for  other
 legislative  bodies across the United States to be recognized and upheld
 by the attorneys general  of  those  states.  Technical  guidance  for
 employers  released  by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
 (EEOC) in December  should  not  be  understood  to  undermine  employee
 constitutional  rights. State legislative bodies must practice oversight
 of such federal assistance  consistent  with  their  enumerated  powers.
 Out-of-state  commercial vendors, including Ticketmaster, cannot require
 venue operators and organizers to  mandate  proof  of  vaccination  from
 concertgoers  and  other paying customers before freely entering a venue
 on private or public property.  K-12  vaccinations  cannot  be  required
 without  certain  clear  and  consistent  exemptions applied, among them
 medical and conscience clauses,  or  risk  forfeiting  a  district's  or
 school  board's  authority  in the State of New York to authorize such a
 mandate, nor can a vaccine mandate for these populations be a factor  in
 state  school-aid  funding. Interstate carriers such as airlines and all
 forms of public transit calling for so-called "vaccine passports"  as  a
 condition of entry cannot be allowed to operate with state licensure and
 waivers.
  §  2.  The public health law is amended by adding a new section 2169-a
 to read as follows:
 A. 6454  3
 
  § 2169-A. VACCINE BILL OF RIGHTS. 1.  NO  PERSONS  WILL  BE  MANDATED,

 ENT OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  FOR  EXAMPLE,  PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANIES
