loving grandmother of Kellie, Dana, Meaghan and Raymond; as well as  the
adored  great-grandmother  of Luca, Stella, Theodore, Rocco and Lorenzo;
and

joys and sorrows characteristic of  and  reserved  for  those  with  the

witnessed and celebrated  the  innovations,  cultural  developments  and
awesome  achievements  of  this  country  during the last century, while
themselves contributing to the  growth  and  excellence  of  this  great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
