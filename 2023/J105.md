  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 14, 2023, as Pakistan Independence Day in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to those who
foster ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity  which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  14,  2023,  as  Pakistan
Independence Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observed  annually  on  the  14th  of  August,  Pakistan
Independence  Day  commemorates  the  day  when  Pakistan  achieved
independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the
British Raj in 1947; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pakistan  came  into existence as a result of the Pakistan
Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in
the north-western regions of British India via partition;  the  movement
was  led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad
Ali Jinnah; and
 
  WHEREAS, The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence  Act
of  1947,  under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion
of Pakistan which comprised West  Pakistan  (present-day  Pakistan)  and
East Pakistan (now Bangladesh); and
 
  WHEREAS,  In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided
with Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded  as
sacred by Muslims; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  main  Independence  Day  ceremony  takes  place  in
Islamabad, where the national flag is hoisted at  the  Presidential  and
Parliament  buildings;  it  is  followed by the national anthem and live
televised speeches by leaders; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, usual celebratory events and  festivities  for
the  day  include flag-raising ceremonies, parades, cultural events, and
the playing of patriotic songs; several award ceremonies are often  held
on  this day, and Pakistanis hoist the national flag atop their homes or
display it prominently on their vehicles and attire; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pakistan Independence Day provides an  excellent  means  by
which  all New Yorkers can learn more about the rich Pakistani heritage,
while fostering an appreciation for this ancient  culture  among  future
generations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to acknowledge various
cultures of people who add to the overall diversity of our State and, on
this occasion, we take the opportunity to  recognize  the  contributions
made  by  the Pakistani-American community and extend best wishes to all
 
of its members as they hold appropriate ceremonies to  commemorate  this
historic milestone; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  14,  2022,  as
Pakistan Independence Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
