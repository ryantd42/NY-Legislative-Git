  3.  THERE SHALL BE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF RELEASE ON RECOGNIZANCE
 FOR EVERY PRINCIPAL BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT. IF, AFTER A HEARING PURSU-
 ANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION, THE  DISTRICT
 OR  SUPREME  COURT  JUDGE FINDS BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT NO
 CONDITIONS  OF  RELEASE  WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND
 WELL-BEING OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE STATE, SAID JUDGE SHALL ORDER  THE
 DETENTION  OF  THE  PRINCIPAL PRIOR TO TRIAL. A PRINCIPAL DETAINED UNDER

 THE SUPREME COURT.
  4. (A) WHEN A PRINCIPAL IS HELD UNDER ARREST FOR AN OFFENSE LISTED  IN

 REPRESENTATION, TO  HAVE  COUNSEL  APPOINTED.  THE  PRINCIPAL  SHALL  BE
 AFFORDED  AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY, TO PRESENT WITNESSES, TO CROSS-EXA-
 MINE WITNESSES WHO APPEAR AT THE HEARING, AND  TO  PRESENT  INFORMATION.
 PRIOR  TO  THE  SUMMONS OF AN ALLEGED VICTIM, OR A MEMBER OF THE ALLEGED
 VICTIM'S FAMILY, TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS AT THE  HEARING,  THE  PRINCIPAL
 SHALL  DEMONSTRATE  TO  THE COURT A GOOD FAITH BASIS FOR THE PRINCIPAL'S
 REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS WILL  BE  MATERIAL
 AND  RELEVANT  TO  SUPPORT  A  CONCLUSION  THAT  THERE ARE CONDITIONS OF
 RELEASE THAT WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND  WELL-BEING
 OF  ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE STATE. THE RULES CONCERNING ADMISSIBILITY OF
 EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL TRIALS SHALL NOT  APPLY  TO  THE  PRESENTATION  AND
 CONSIDERATION OF INFORMATION AT THE HEARING AND THE JUDGE SHALL CONSIDER
 HEARSAY CONTAINED IN A POLICE REPORT, THE STATEMENT OF AN ALLEGED VICTIM
 OR  WITNESS,  AND  SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO ANY MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION THE
 PRINCIPAL HAS UNDERGONE PRIOR TO HEARING. THE FACTS THE  JUDGE  USES  TO
 SUPPORT  FINDINGS PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION, THAT NO
 CONDITIONS WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF
 ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE STATE, SHALL BE SUPPORTED BY CLEAR AND  CONVINC-
 ING  EVIDENCE. IN A DETENTION ORDER ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
 SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION THE JUDGE SHALL: (I)  INCLUDE  WRITTEN
 FINDINGS  OF  FACT  AND  A  WRITTEN  STATEMENT  OF  THE  REASONS FOR THE
 DETENTION; (II) DIRECT THAT THE PRINCIPAL BE  COMMITTED  TO  CUSTODY  OR

 BLE, FROM PRINCIPALS AWAITING OR  SERVING  SENTENCE  OR  BEING  HELD  IN
 CUSTODY PENDING APPEAL OR A COMMUNITY TREATMENT CENTER; AND (III) DIRECT
 THAT  THE  PRINCIPAL  BE  AFFORDED  REASONABLE  OPPORTUNITY  FOR PRIVATE
 A. 1550  5
 
 CONSULTATION WITH HIS OR HER COUNSEL.  THE  PRINCIPAL  MAY  BE  DETAINED
 PENDING  COMPLETION  OF  THE HEARING. THE HEARING MAY BE REOPENED BY THE
 JUDGE, AT ANY TIME BEFORE TRIAL, OR UPON A MOTION OF THE PEOPLE  OR  THE
 PRINCIPAL  DETAINED IF THE JUDGE FINDS THAT: (A) INFORMATION EXISTS THAT
 WAS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE HEARING OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE
 IN CIRCUMSTANCES; AND (B) THAT SUCH INFORMATION  OR  CHANGE  IN  CIRCUM-
 STANCES  HAS A MATERIAL BEARING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE ARE CONDI-
 TIONS OF RELEASE THAT WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE  COMMUNITY  SAFETY  AND
 WELL-BEING OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE STATE.
  5.  IN  HIS OR HER DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS OF
 RELEASE THAT WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND  WELL-BEING
 OF  ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE STATE, SAID JUDGE SHALL, ON THE BASIS OF ANY
 INFORMATION WHICH HE OR SHE CAN REASONABLY OBTAIN, TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
 NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE DANGER POSED TO ANY OTHER  PERSON  OR  THE
 COMMUNITY  THAT  WOULD RESULT BY THE PRINCIPAL'S RELEASE, THE NATURE AND
 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED, THE POTENTIAL PENALTY THE  PRINCI-
 PAL  FACES,  THE  PRINCIPAL'S FAMILY TIES, EMPLOYMENT RECORD, HISTORY OF
 MENTAL ILLNESS,  AND  REPUTATION,  THE  RISK  THAT  THE  PRINCIPAL  WILL

 IDATE OR ATTEMPT TO THREATEN, INJURE OR INTIMIDATE A PROSPECTIVE WITNESS
 OR JUROR, HIS OR HER RECORD OF CONVICTIONS, IF  ANY,  ANY  ILLEGAL  DRUG
 DISTRIBUTION  OR  PRESENT  DRUG DEPENDENCY, AND WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL IS
