 AN  ACT to amend the economic development law, in relation to establish-
  ing the strategic site readiness fund;  and  making  an  appropriation
  therefor

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The economic development law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 article 27 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 27
  STRATEGIC SITE READINESS FUND
 SECTION 490. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  491. ADMINISTRATION.
  492. STRATEGIC SITE READINESS FUND.
  493. REPORTING.
  §  490.  LEGISLATIVE  INTENT. IT IS HEREBY FOUND AND DECLARED THAT NEW
 YORK STATE NEEDS, AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY, TO CULTIVATE A  RESOURCE
 OF  COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL SITES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO NEW BUSI-
 NESSES, ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES THAT ARE CONSIDERING MOVING TO THE STATE,
 OR EXISTING BUSINESSES WITHIN THE STATE THAT NEED  ADDITIONAL  SITES  TO
 REMAIN OR EXPAND WITHIN THE STATE. TO EXPAND AND SUSTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH
 WITHIN THE STATE, IT IS CRITICAL TO CONSISTENTLY MAINTAIN READILY AVAIL-
 ABLE  COMMERCIAL,  INDUSTRIAL  SITES  TO ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS, OR EXPAND
 EXISTING BUSINESSES. WITHOUT A STABLE INVENTORY OF SITES THAT ARE  READY
 OR  ABLE  TO BE DEVELOPED IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR BUSINESS USE, THE DELAY
 IN CONVERTING  UNDEVELOPED  SITES  CAPABLE  OF  CONDUCTING  BUSINESS  IN
 COMPLIANCE  WITH  APPLICABLE  REGULATIONS  AND  ORDINANCES MAY CAUSE THE
 STATE TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT  THE
 ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF ITS CITIZENS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
