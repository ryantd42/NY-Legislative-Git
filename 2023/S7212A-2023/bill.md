  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section  180-a  of  the  military  law  is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (l) to read as follows:
  (1) "LEGACY CADET CORPS PROGRAM" SHALL MEAN A CADET CORPS OR ORGANIZED
 MILITIA  PROGRAM  THAT  HAS ACCESSED OR USED A REGIMENTAL ARMORY LOCATED
 WITHIN A CITY THAT HAS A POPULATION OF OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE FOR  OVER
 ONE HUNDRED YEARS DURING PERIODS WHICH ARE NOT PERIODS OF CIVIL OR MILI-
 TARY EMERGENCY.
  §  2.  Paragraph (e) of subdivision 3 of section 180-a of the military
 law, as added by chapter 482 of the laws of 2004, is amended and  a  new
 paragraph (f) is added to read as follows:
  (e)  The management agreement and lease shall not apply to shelter use
 OR TO A LEGACY CADET CORPS PROGRAM.  Shelter use shall be governed by  a
 separate  agreement  between  the  city  of New York, the lessee and the
 state of New York; such separate agreement shall be  executed  prior  to
 the  execution  of  the lease. A LEGACY CADET CORPS PROGRAM USE SHALL BE
 GOVERNED BY A SEPARATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DIVISION AND THE  STATE  OF
 NEW  YORK;  SUCH SEPARATE AGREEMENT SHALL BE EXECUTED ONCE A CADET CORPS
 PROGRAM IS DETERMINED TO BE A LEGACY CADET CORPS PROGRAM.

  (F) A CADET CORPS PROGRAM  SHALL  QUALIFY  AS  A  LEGACY  CADET  CORPS
 PROGRAM IF SUCH PROGRAM CAN SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATE TO THE URBAN DEVEL-
 OPMENT  CORPORATION  THAT THE CADET CORPS PROGRAM HAS USED OR OCCUPIED A
 REGIMENTAL ARMORY FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.  METHODS  OF  SUFFICIENTLY
 PROVING  USE  OR OCCUPANCY SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, PHOTOS,
 NOTARIZED STATEMENTS, LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THE PROGRAM, BANK STATEMENTS,
 AND UTILITY BILLS. IF A CADET CORPS PROGRAM QUALIFIES AS A LEGACY  CADET
 CORPS PROGRAM, THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION SHALL DESIGNATE THEM AS
 SUCH  AND IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH SUCH
 PROGRAM.
  § 3. Subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of  subdivision  3  of  section
 180-a  of the military law, as added by chapter 482 of the laws of 2004,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (i) On application of any of the associations  of  veterans  OR  CADET
 CORPS  PROGRAMS,  INCLUDING  A  LEGACY CADET CORPS PROGRAM, described in
 [paragraph] PARAGRAPHS A AND b of subdivision one of  such  section  one
 hundred eighty-three, the lessee or the manager pursuant to the terms of
 the  management  agreement shall provide a proper and convenient room or
 rooms or other appropriate space in the armory where such posts or chap-
 ters may hold regular and special  meetings  and  organizational  social
 events of a private nature, without the payment of any charge or expense
 therefor,  provided that such use does not interfere with the use by the
 lessee or the manager pursuant to the terms of the management agreement,
 including any use by third parties  contracted  for  under  subparagraph
 (ii) of this paragraph.
  §  4. Subdivision (b) of section 39 of section 1 of chapter 174 of the
 laws of 1968, constituting the New York state urban  development  corpo-
 ration  act,  as added by chapter 482 of the laws of 2004, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (b) The lease with a lessee or subsequent lessee  authorized  by  this
 section  shall  require  a  lessee  or  subsequent lessee to undertake a
 program of repair, restoration and refurbishment of the  armory  and  to
 manage and use the same as a facility for cultural and other civic uses.
 The  lease  shall  demise  all  portions  of the armory other than those
 reserved for a homeless shelter for women operated by the  city  of  New
 York pursuant to agreement with the state, THOSE SPACES RESERVED FOR USE
 BY  A  LEGACY  CADET  CORPS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
 DIVISION AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK, and for that reserved  for  military
 use  by the division. The portion of the premises allocated to the shel-
 ter for homeless women shall be sufficient and suitable  space  for  the
 current  and  uninterrupted  operation of the shelter by the city of New
 York. THE PORTION OF THE PREMISES ALLOCATED  TO  A  LEGACY  CADET  CORPS
 PROGRAM SHALL BE SUFFICIENT AND SUITABLE SPACE FOR THE CURRENT AND UNIN-
 TERRUPTED  OPERATION,  PROVIDED  THAT  IT IS NO LESS THAN TWELVE HUNDRED
 SQUARE FEET FOR THEIR HEADQUARTERS. The division shall cause  the  107th
 corps  support  group  or its lineal descendent to maintain military use
 within the reserved portions of the armory. The division, and  the  city
 of  New  York, respectively, shall be responsible to repair and maintain
 their reserved premises, including the costs of renovation and  uninter-
 rupted  use,  and to pay an annual common maintenance charge to a lessee
 or subsequent lessee to cover allocated costs of repair, maintenance and
 operation of the common portions of the armory. The lessee or subsequent
 lessee shall be required to apply all revenues generated  by  operations
 at  the  armory  to  pay  or  provide for costs of repairs, restoration,
 refurbishment, operating, maintenance and programming of the armory  and

 the  uses  therein and the activities of the lessee or subsequent lessee
 with respect thereto.
