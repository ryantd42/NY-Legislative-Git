 Introduced  by  Sen.  ASHBY  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to prehospital  emer-
  gency medical services for individuals in substance use recovery
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that emer-
 gency personnel are trained to look for intoxication, but not trained to
 ask a patient if they identify as a person in  substance  use  recovery.
 People  in  recovery work extremely hard to maintain recovery and should
 not be placed in a situation where their recovery  is  compromised.  The
 legislature  finds that emergency personnel need to be trained in how to
 communicate the risks of certain medications that could compromise their
 recovery and what possible alternatives are available.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  3000-f
 to read as follows:
  § 3000-F. PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES; SUBSTANCE USE RECOV-
 ERY.  1.  THE  DEPARTMENT,  THE  STATE COUNCIL, AND THE REGIONAL COUNCIL
 SHALL INCLUDE IN THEIR POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND PROTOCOLS FOR PREHOSPI-
 TAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND  TRANSPORTATION,  STANDARDS  FOR  THE
 ASSESSMENT  AND  TREATMENT  OF  PATIENTS  WHO  IDENTIFY  AS  A PERSON IN
 SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY. SUCH POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND  PROTOCOLS  SHALL
 INCLUDE  POINT-OF-ENTRY  CRITERIA AND PLANS FOR THE TRIAGE AND TRANSPORT
 OF INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS A PERSON IN SUBSTANCE  USE  RECOVERY.  AT
 MINIMUM SUCH POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND PROTOCOLS SHALL REQUIRE EMERGENCY
 MEDICAL SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO COMMUNICATE TO INDIVID-
 UALS  WHO  IDENTIFY  AS  A PERSON IN SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY THE RISKS OF
 CERTAIN MEDICATIONS THAT COULD COMPROMISE SUCH INDIVIDUALS' RECOVERY  BY
 OFFERING ALTERNATE OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT AND INFORMING THE HOSPITAL THAT
 SUCH INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIES AS A PERSON IN SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7614  2
 
  2.  BEGINNING UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE DEPARTMENT,
 THE STATE COUNCIL, AND THE REGIONAL COUNCIL SHALL  ANNUALLY  REVIEW  AND
 UPDATE,  IF  APPROPRIATE,  THEIR POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND PROTOCOLS FOR
 PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL  SERVICES  AND  TRANSPORTATION  TO  ENSURE
 INDIVIDUALS  WHO  IDENTIFY  AS  A  PERSON  IN SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY ARE
 RECEIVING ADEQUATE INFORMATION PRIOR TO TREATMENT.
  § 3. Section 3053 of the public health law, as amended by chapter  445
 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  §  3053.  Reporting.  1. Advanced life support first response services
 and ambulance services registered or certified pursuant to article thir-
 ty of this chapter shall submit detailed individual call  reports  on  a
 form to be provided by the department, or may submit data electronically
 in  a  format  approved by the department.  The state emergency medical
 services council, with the approval of the commissioner, may adopt rules
 and regulations permitting or requiring ambulance services whose  volume
 exceeds  twenty thousand calls per year to submit call report data elec-
 tronically.  Such rules shall define the data elements to be  submitted,
 and  may  include  requirements  that assure availability of data to the
 regional emergency medical advisory committee.
  2. SUCH INDIVIDUAL CALL REPORT FORM, AND SUCH FORM'S ALTERNATIVE ELEC-
 TRONIC FORMAT, SHALL INCLUDE  WHETHER  AN  INDIVIDUAL  IDENTIFIES  AS  A
 PERSON  IN  SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY AND, IF KNOWN, SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S TYPE
 OF ADDICTION DISEASE.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
