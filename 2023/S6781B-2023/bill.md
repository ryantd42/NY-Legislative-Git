 service operated pursuant to a contract with the city, any county within
 the state of New York, the state of New York or any other state or local
 government that follows the applicable procurement rules and regulations
 of  such  jurisdiction  regardless  of  the seating capacity of any such
 vehicle. The commission shall submit to the  council  the  text  of  any

  § 2. Paragraph 1 of subdivision a of section 19-504 of the administra-
 tive code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 115 of
 the city of New York for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  (1) A taxi-cab, coach, wheelchair  accessible  van,  commuter  van  or
 for-hire  vehicle  shall operate within the city of New York only if the
 owner shall first have obtained from the commission  a  taxicab,  coach,
 wheelchair  accessible van, commuter van or for-hire vehicle license for
 such vehicle and only while such license is in full  force  and  effect.
 Vehicle  licenses  shall  be  issued for a term of not less than one nor
 more than two years and shall expire  on  the  date  set  forth  on  the
 license  unless  sooner suspended or revoked by the commission. No motor
 vehicle other than a duly licensed taxicab OR COMMUTER VAN WHERE AUTHOR-
 IZED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION C OF SECTION 19-502 OF THIS  CHAPTER  shall
 be  permitted to accept hails from passengers in the street. No commuter

 service duly issued by the commission pursuant to  section  19-504.2  of
 this chapter.

 ter  van  service  and no person who owns, operates or drives a commuter

 service  to  a  passenger  unless  such service to a passenger is on the
 basis of a telephone contract or other prearrangement. Where a violation
 of this subdivision has been committed by a driver of  a  commuter  van,
 the  commuter  van  service  and the owner of such vehicle shall also be
 liable for a violation of this subdivision.
