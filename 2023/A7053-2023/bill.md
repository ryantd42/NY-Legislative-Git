 THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, PROMOTE
 DEMOCRACY, AND REDUCE RATES OF RECIDIVISM WITHIN THE STATE. THIS PROGRAM

 UPON THEIR RELEASE FROM A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

 RIGOROUS  CURRICULUM,  AND  PARTICIPANTS SHALL BE INSTRUCTED ON SUBJECTS
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, VOTING RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS,
 CURRENT AFFAIRS, AND SIMULATIONS OF VOTER  REGISTRATION,  ELECTION,  AND
 DEMOCRATIC  PROCESSES.  THE PROGRAM SHALL CONSIST OF THREE SESSIONS THAT
 ARE NINETY MINUTES EACH WHICH DO NOT NEED TO BE TAKEN CONSECUTIVELY. THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL OFFER THE REENTERING CITIZENS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT  PROGRAM
 TO  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUALS  SCHEDULED  TO  BE  RELEASED WITHIN TWELVE
 MONTHS, AND EACH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL SHALL ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM ONE
 TO TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO HIS OR  HER  EXPECTED  DATE  OF  RELEASE.  THE
