  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing  an  amendment to section 24 of article 6 of the constitution,
  in relation to  extending  the  power  of  impeachment  and  trial  of
  impeachment to former office holders for impeachable conduct committed
  while in office
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 24 of arti-
 cle 6 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  24. The assembly shall have the power of impeachment by a vote of a
 majority of all the members elected thereto.  THE POWER  OF  IMPEACHMENT
 AND  THE  TRIAL  OF  AN  IMPEACHMENT SHALL EXTEND TO THE IMPEACHMENT AND
 TRIAL OF ANY PERSON WHO FORMERLY HELD A PUBLIC OFFICE OF  HONOR,  TRUST,
 OR  PROFIT UNDER THIS STATE FOR IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT COMMITTED WHILE SUCH
 PERSON HELD SUCH OFFICE. The court for the trial of  impeachments  shall
 be  composed  of the president of the senate, the senators, or the major
 part of them, and the judges of the court of appeals, or the major  part
 of them. On the trial of an impeachment against the governor or lieuten-
 ant-governor,  neither  the lieutenant-governor nor the temporary presi-
 dent of the senate shall act as a member of the court. No judicial offi-
 cer shall exercise his or  her  office  after  articles  of  impeachment
 against  him or her shall have been preferred to the senate, until he or
 she shall have been acquitted.  Before the trial of an impeachment,  the
 members  of the court shall take an oath or affirmation truly and impar-
 tially to try the impeachment according to the evidence, and  no  person
 shall  be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
 present. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further  than
 to  removal  from office, or removal from office and disqualification to
 hold and enjoy any public office of honor, trust, or profit  under  this
 state, OR DISQUALIFICATION TO HOLD AND ENJOY ANY PUBLIC OFFICE OF HONOR,
 TRUST,  OR  PROFIT  UNDER THIS STATE WHERE THE PARTY IMPEACHED NO LONGER

 HOLDS OFFICE AT THE TIME JUDGMENT IS RENDERED; but the  party  impeached
 shall be liable to indictment and punishment according to law.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing be referred
 to  the  first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after the next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
