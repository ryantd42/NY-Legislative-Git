 ANY  ADDITIONAL  CONDITIONS  SPECIFIED  THEREIN.  NOTWITHSTANDING  SUCH
 PROVISION AS CONTAINED IN THE NOTE AND MORTGAGE, ALL OR A PORTION OF THE
 PRINCIPAL OF THE LOAN SHALL BE REDUCED TO ZERO  ONLY  IF,  PRIOR  TO  OR
 SIMULTANEOUSLY  WITH DELIVERY OF SUCH NOTE AND MORTGAGE, THE AGENCY MADE
 A WRITTEN DETERMINATION THAT SUCH REDUCTION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE
 THE CONTINUED AFFORDABILITY OR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE HOUSING  ACCOM-
 MODATIONS  ASSISTED BY SUCH LOAN. SUCH WRITTEN DETERMINATION SHALL DOCU-
 MENT THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE LOAN WAS DETERMINED  TO  BE  ELIGIBLE  FOR
 EVAPORATION.
