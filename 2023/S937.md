 Introduced  by  Sens. BAILEY, JACKSON -- read twice and ordered printed,

 AN ACT relating to creating the commission on affordable college  educa-
  tion  to  study  the participation of community colleges in the educa-
  tional opportunity program; and  providing  for  the  repeal  of  such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  hereby  acknowledges
 the  need for a college education to compete in today's market. Further-
 more, residents throughout New York state are in need of more affordable
 higher education options. Currently,  twelve  out  of  the  thirty  SUNY
 community  colleges  do  not  participate in the Educational Opportunity
 Programs (EOP), which provide vital financial and academic  support  for
 thousands  of  academic  and  economically  disadvantaged  New  Yorkers
 throughout the state.  Subsequently,  community  college  students  from
 those  twelve  two-year  colleges, who seek to transfer into a four-year
 school as Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or EOP  applicants
 risk potentially disqualifying themselves for such financial and academ-
 ic support programs.
  §  2.  A temporary state commission, to be known as the "commission on
 affordable college education", is hereby established to examine,  evalu-
 ate  and  make  recommendations  concerning the need for the twelve SUNY
 community colleges to participate in EOP. The commission shall  consider
 the  need for additional legislation to amend current eligibility crite-
 ria for transfer students.
  § 3. The commission shall consist of thirteen members, to be appointed
 as follows: three members to be appointed by the governor; three members
 to be appointed by the temporary president of the senate; three  members
 to  be  appointed  by  the  speaker  of  the assembly; two members to be
 appointed by the minority leader of the senate; and two  members  to  be

 appointed by the minority leader of the assembly. The members shall have
 demonstrated  expertise  in and experience in the field of higher educa-
 tion, HEOP, or EOP. A chairperson and vice-chairperson of  such  commis-
 sion  shall be elected by the majority of its members, all members being
 present.
  § 4. The members of the commission shall receive no  compensation  for
 their services, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses
 incurred in the performance of their duties hereunder.
  §  5.  The commission may employ and at pleasure remove such personnel
 as it may deem necessary for the  performance  of  its  functions.  Such
 commission  may  meet  and hold public and/or private hearings within or
 without the state, and shall  have  all  the  powers  of  a  legislative
 committee pursuant to the legislative law.
  §  6.  For the accomplishment of its purposes, the commission shall be
 authorized and empowered to undertake any studies, inquiries, surveys or
 analyses it may deem relevant in cooperation with or by  agreement  with
 any other public or private agency.
  § 7. The commission shall make a report of its findings, including any
 recommendations  for  legislative  action  as  it may deem necessary and
 appropriate, to the governor, the temporary president of the senate  and
 the  speaker  of the assembly no later than one year after the effective
 date of this act.
  § 8. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 become  a  law  and  shall expire and be deemed repealed two years after
 such date.
