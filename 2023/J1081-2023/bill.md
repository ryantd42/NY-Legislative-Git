BY: Senator PALUMBO
 
  COMMENDING the Ocular Melanoma Foundation upon the
  occasion of hosting its Eye Patch Days on May 19-21,
  2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
commend  and  recognize  those  esteemed  individuals  and organizations
within the medical  community  for  their  extraordinary  and  sustained
contributions  to  the progress of medicine and the improvement of life;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend the Ocular
Melanoma Foundation upon the occasion of hosting its Eye Patch  Days  on
May 19-21, 2023, in conjunction with the observance of National Melanoma
Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ocular Melanoma (OM), scientifically named uveal melanoma,
is a cancer (melanoma) of the eye involving the iris, ciliary  body,  or
choroid, collectively referred to as the uvea; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tumors  arise  from  the  pigment cells (melanocytes) that
reside within the uvea giving color to the eye;  these  melanocytes  are
distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina
that do not form melanomas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Ocular  Melanoma  Foundation (OMF) was established in
2003 by Dr. Robert C. Allen, a Harvard-trained ophthalmologist, and  his
eldest son, Grant Allen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Allen was also an OM patient, and in confronting this
relatively rare disease as both doctor and patient, he was struck by the
lack of up-to-date treatment information available  to  patients,  their
families  and  healthcare  professionals,  as  well  as  the  paucity of
research initiatives devoted to  ocular/uveal  melanoma  as  a  melanoma
wholly distinct from skin cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  a  nonprofit  charitable  corporation,  the Ocular
Melanoma Foundation remains the leading resource for eye cancer research
funding and patient/caregiver support, and is often the first stop in  a
newly diagnosed patient's treatment journey; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital  organization  is  committed  to
accelerating and enhancing scientific research, advocacy, and  awareness
of  ocular  melanoma,  as  well as to providing education and support to
patients, their families, and healthcare professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Specifically, OMF is raising funds,  engaging  academicians
and  clinicians,  and  actively  partnering  with  foundations and other
leading agencies supporting cancer research to: support  and  accelerate
scientific  research  and  discovery  and its translation into effective
treatment options for patients;  provide  resources  for  education  and
support  to OM patients, their families, and to healthcare professionals
treating OM; and act as an advocate  within  the  melanoma  and  broader
 
cancer  community  to raise the awareness of OM and the need for a cure;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  part  of  Melanoma  Awareness  Month,  OMF is proud to
support the annual Eye  Patch  Days  to  increase  awareness  of  ocular
melanoma and the need for dilated eye exams; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On these days, OMF Warriors around the globe will wear eye
patches to raise awareness for ocular melanoma; wearing an eye patch  is
a  great  way  to  start  a  conversation  with  co-workers, friends and
neighbors about OM and how important it is  to  see  an  ophthalmologist
regularly; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, it is imperative that there be greater public
awareness of this serious  health  issue,  and  more  must  be  done  to
increase  activity  at  the local, state, and national levels to support
these patients as well as their families; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Ocular Melanoma Foundation upon the occasion of hosting  its
Eye Patch Days on May 19-21, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Ocular Melanoma Foundation.
