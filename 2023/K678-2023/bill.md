  devoted member of his community
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality  of life in our community, and the world at large, and have
had a measurable positive impact on the lives  of  its  residents;  Alan
Moskin was one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  sorrow  and  deep  regret  that  this
Legislative  Body  records  the  passing  of  Alan  Moskin,  noting  the
significance of his purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alan  Moskin,  a  World War II infantry soldier who helped
liberate a Nazi death camp and spent decades  educating  people  on  the
Nazi  Holocaust and his experiences, died peacefully, befittingly during
Yom HaShoah, on April 15, 2023, in Charleston, South  Carolina,  at  the
age of 96; and

  WHEREAS,  On  May  4,  1945,  at  the age of 18, Alan Moskin entered
Gunskirchen  to  liberate  the  survivors;  he  lay  witness  to  the
unfathomable; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1985, Alan Moskin began discussing what he had witnessed
over  40 years prior and stated that when he began speaking, it was like
a catharsis, a purging of  all  the  poison,  he  passionately  preached
against inhumanity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alan  Moskin  participated  in  numerous recordings at the
Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City, for  USC  Shoah  Foundation,

where he offered generations a soldier's personal view of the Holocaust;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alan Moskin, in 2014, was inducted into the New York State
Veterans Hall of Fame and the following  year  he  was  elected  by  the
Veteran's  Coordinating  Council  in Rockland County, New York to be the
"2016 Veteran of the Year"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alan Moskin is survived by his daughter  Jacqueline  Moskin
Corcoran  (Hugh),  daughter  Lisa  Moskin; grandchildren, Rory Corcoran,
 
Conor Corcoran, Molly Corcoran, Brody Tonon, Chase Tonon, Trevor  Tonon,
Cole Tonon, and former wife Christa Moskin; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, Alan Moskin leaves behind a legacy which  will  long  endure
the  passage  of  time  and will remain as a comforting memory to all he
served and befriended; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn the death of Alan Moskin and to express its deepest condolences to
his family; and be it further
