disabilities across this great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  E. John Gavras Center of Auburn, New York, has served

celebrates its 70th Anniversary on Thursday, February 16, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Formerly known as The United  Cerebral  Palsy  Association,
the  E.  John Gavras Center was founded in 1953, out of a need for more
specialized local care  for  children  with  varying  disabilities;  the
Center  proved successful with the need for expanding services and staff
just two years since its inception; and
 
  WHEREAS, A hallmark of the E. John Gavras  Center  has  always  been
cooperation  with  community  organizations  and  responsiveness  to the
specific needs of the local citizenry; this philosophy  has  grown  over
the  past  70  years,  and  has evolved into an evaluation and treatment
facility of the highest quality in Cayuga County; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over a decade  ago,  their  services  expanded  to  include
school  age children as well as adults, creating a continuum of care for
individuals as they transition through critical life stages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The vision of the  E.  John  Gavras  Center  is  to  be  an
innovative  leader  in  the  provision  of  person-centered services and
supports, primarily for those individuals of all ages with special needs
and their families through an array of quality  programs  and  services;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  With unwavering commitment to their community, the E. John
Gavras Center listens to its clients and their families to help create a
plan for individuals to live out the life they imagine  for  themselves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  so  effectively  carrying out its mission, the E. John
Gavras Center has demonstrated the value of providing the necessary care
and  resources  to  people  with  intellectual  and  developmental
disabilities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the E. John Gavras Center upon the occasion of  celebrating  its
70th Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Danielle Wright, Executive Director and  CEO  of  the  E.
