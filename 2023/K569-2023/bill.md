  COMMEMORATING the 40th Anniversary of the Southern
  Tier Independence Center of Binghamton, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of the Legislative Body to recognize those
established  organizations within our communities that, year after year,
diligently work to improve the quality of life for its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 40th  Anniversary  of  the  Southern  Tier  Independence
Center of Binghamton, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Co-founded by Maria Dibble and Frank Pennisi, Southern Tier
Independence  Center  (STIC)  is  an  independent  living center serving
children and adults with all types  of  disabilities  and  promotes  the
independence,  integration  and inclusion of people with disabilities in
all aspects of community life including employment, recreation, housing,
education, volunteering, and civil responsibilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, STIC also  provides  support,  consultation,  training  and
services  to families, businesses, agencies and others in its community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The current  Executive  Director  and  totally  blind  from
birth,  Maria  Dibble  has  experienced  the  discrimination  and  false
assumptions that people make when meeting a person  with  a  disability,
underestimating  what  they  can  do,  or even completely dismissing it;
nevertheless, she was integrated into regular schools as a child, and is
a graduate of Binghamton University,  and  she  understands  the  issues
faced by children and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  STIC  has grown from its humble beginnings with a grant of
$100,000 and four employees to a budget of $17  million  and  about  750
employees,  all  dedicated  to  the  independence  of  people  with
disabilities, and advocating for their civil and economic rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, For her steadfast and unremitting commitment  to  STIC  and
those  with  disabilities,  Maria  Dibble  was  inducted  into  the  NYS
Disability Rights Hall of Fame in 2019 and  was  the  recipient  of  the
David Veatch Advocacy Award from the New York Association on Independent
Living (NYAIL); and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, STIC's cofounder and retired Disability Rights
and  Accessibility  Director  Frank  Pennisi,  and  its current Advocacy
Director Susan Ruff were also awarded the David  Veatch  Advocacy  Award
from  NYAIL  for  their  relentless  advocacy even on seemingly hopeless
issues; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, STIC has  supported  many  issues  and
legislation  including  the  ADA,  Consumer Directed Personal Assistance
Program, the development of the Traumatic Brain Injury and Nursing  Home
Transition  and  Diversion  Waivers,  election reform, and polling place
accessibility; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, The success of STIC is in direct correlation to the efforts
of its staff whose involvement is, and always has been, characterized by
an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the institution and
the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  40th  Anniversary  of  the  Southern Tier Independence
Center of Binghamton, New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Maria  Dibble,  Executive  Director,  Southern  Tier
Independence Center.
