 AN ACT directing the department of corrections and community supervision
  to test a program of supplying inmates with  tablets  for  educational
  and recreational means

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative finding. The bureau of  prisons  offers  secure
 email  service to all federal inmates nationwide. County jails in numer-

 educational  and  recreational  programs  including secure email reduces
 idle time, improves morale and increases inmate productivity. Therefore,
 the legislature finds that it would be beneficial for the department  of
 corrections  and  community  supervision operate a pilot program to test
 the benefit of providing secure email and other electronic  programs  to
 inmates.
  §  2.  The  department  of corrections and community supervision shall
 develop and implement a pilot program to test the benefit of  a  tablet-
 based  portfolio  of  educational  and  recreation programs, including a
 secured email program, to improve inmate communication with his  or  her
 family,  attorney,  community  members  and  organizations, and with the
 department itself. Such pilot program shall include no fewer than thirty
 non-internet based tablet devices providing a secure email communication
 program in addition  to  educational  and  recreational  programs  which
 consider  the  unique  needs  and circumstances of the inmate population
 including factors related to health,  age,  education,  religion,  voca-
 tional  training and other determining characteristics as the department
 may deem appropriate. One year after the department shall have commenced
 the pilot program the department shall issue a report  to  the  governor
 and the legislature on the impact of the pilot program on facility safe-

 ty,  inmate  behavior and performance, and other indicators of the value
 of providing such tablet-based devices in the correctional setting.
  §  3. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become a
 law.
