  CELEBRATING Holi, an ancient Hindu Spring Festival
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
events  which  foster  ethnic  pride and enhance the profile of cultural
diversity which strengthens the fabric of the communities  of  New  York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to celebrate Holi, an
ancient Hindu Spring Festival; and
 
  WHEREAS, Holi is an ancient Hindu Spring Festival, also known as the
Festival  of  Colors,  which  celebrates fertility, color, love, and the
triumph of good over evil; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Festival signifies the coming of  spring,  the  joy  of
friendship, and equality for all; and
 
  WHEREAS, The colored powders used in Holi represent love, happiness,
and  the  freedom to live vibrantly, which are all principles shared and
promoted by the Caribbean Equality Project (CEP); and
 
  WHEREAS, The origins of the festival can be found in various legends
in Hindu mythology, one of which tells the story of a demon, Holika, and
her brother, King Hiranyakashipu; on the night before Holi, bonfires are
lit to signify the burning of Holika and the victory of good over  evil;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year,  Holi begins on Tuesday, March 7th and ends on
Wednesday, March 8th; the timing of Holi depends on  the  moon,  meaning
the  date  of the event can vary, although it usually occurs in March to
mark the end of winter; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  events  which  symbolize  the  historical,  social and cultural
development of this great State and embody the spirit of the  principles
upon which this Nation was founded; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate Holi, an ancient Hindu Spring Festival.
