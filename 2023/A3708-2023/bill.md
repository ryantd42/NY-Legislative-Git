 PERSON  IN  PARENTAL  RELATION TO THE STUDENT, EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL SHALL

 SCHOOL'S WRITTEN MATERIAL DESCRIBING FOOD OFFERINGS  SHALL  INCLUDE  THE
 AVAILABILITY  OF A PLANT-BASED FOOD OPTION.  THE PLANT-BASED FOOD OPTION
 SHALL BE OFFERED AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO THE STUDENT BEYOND WHAT  WOULD

 REQUEST MADE UNDER THIS SECTION,  CONSISTENT  WITH  GUIDANCE  BY  SCHOOL
 AUTHORITIES.  THE  REQUEST  SHALL  BE EFFECTIVE FOR EVERY SCHOOL MEAL OR
 SNACK IN WHICH THE STUDENT IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO  PARTICIPATE.  THIS
 SECTION  DOES  NOT  PRECLUDE THE OFFERING OF PLANT-BASED FOOD OPTIONS TO
 STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT REQUESTED IT, AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE AN  INDIVIDUAL
 WHO  HAS REQUESTED A PLANT-BASED FOOD OPTION FROM SELECTING A NON-PLANT-
 BASED FOOD OPTION.
