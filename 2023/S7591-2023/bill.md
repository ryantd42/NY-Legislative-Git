 ication required by subdivision seven of section  ninety-two-d  of  this
 article,  the  comptroller  must notify the commissioner of taxation and
 finance that all remaining funds held in the  stock  transfer  tax  fund
 must  be  released  to the stock transfer incentive fund. From that time
 forward, all funds previously deposited in the stock transfer  tax  fund
 pursuant  to  subdivision two of this section will be deposited directly
 into the stock transfer incentive fund pursuant to all the rules,  regu-
 lations  or  instructions  that  the  commissioner  may prescribe, after
 deducting the amount the commissioner determines  to  be  necessary  for
 reasonable  costs  of  the  department  in administering, collecting and
 distributing the tax imposed by article  twelve  of  the  tax  law,  AND

 AMOUNT THE COMPTROLLER DETERMINES IS NECESSARY  TO  FUND  THE  UNIVERSAL
 BASIC INCOME PILOT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO A CHAPTER OF THE LAWS
 OF  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of
 this article, to the extent those moneys are not required by  the  stock
 transfer  incentive  fund  for  the  purpose of administering and making
 distributions in accordance with the provisions of section  two  hundred
 eighty-a  of  the  tax law, as certified by the commissioner of taxation
 and finance, the balance will be appropriated to the city  of  New  York
 for the support of local government.
  § 3. The sum of two hundred eighty-eight million ($288,000,000), or so
 much  thereof  as  may be necessary, is hereby appropriated to the state

 program, not otherwise appropriated, and fifty percent out of the moneys
 in  the  stock  transfer  tax  fund to the credit of the universal basic
 income pilot program, and made immediately available, for the purpose of
 carrying out the provisions of this act. Such moneys shall be payable on
 the audit and warrant  of  the  comptroller  on  vouchers  certified  or
 approved by the comptroller in the manner prescribed by law.

 deemed repealed five years after such date.
