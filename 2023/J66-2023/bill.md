  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 25, 2023, as DNA Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are set aside to increase awareness of significant
events which commemorate milestones of medical importance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2023, as DNA Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
DNA Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  began
celebrating  National  DNA  Day  annually  on April 25th after the 108th
Congress passed concurrent resolutions designating it as such; and
 
  WHEREAS, This special day also recognizes the successful  completion
of  the  Human Genome Project in April of 2003; this project gave us the
ability, for the first time, to read nature's complete genetic blueprint
for building a human being; and
 
  WHEREAS, The goal of National DNA Day is to offer students, teachers
and the public an opportunity to learn about and  celebrate  the  latest
advances in genomic research and explore how those advances might impact
their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, National DNA Day celebrates the discovery and understanding
of DNA and the scientific advances that understanding has made possible;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2023, as DNA Day
in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
