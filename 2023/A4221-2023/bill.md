  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The section heading and subdivisions 5 and 5-a  of  section
 401  of the vehicle and traffic law, subdivision 5 as amended by chapter
 136 of the laws of 1969, paragraph a of  subdivision  5  as  amended  by
 chapter  137  of  the  laws  of  1989, paragraph b of subdivision 5 as
 amended by chapter 826 of the laws of 1985, and paragraph c of  subdivi-
 sion 5 as amended by chapter 356 of the laws of 1990, subdivision 5-a as

 as  separately  added  by chapters 421, 460 and 773 of the laws of 2021,

  Registration of motor vehicles; fees[; renewals].
  5. [Times for] VALIDITY OF registration[, reregistration and renewal];
 proportionate  fees.  [a.  Registrations,  reregistrations  and renewals
 shall take effect and expire on dates determined  by  the  commissioner.
 However,  where  the expiration date of the registration of any vehicle,
 except a taxi or an omnibus, falls on a Saturday, Sunday or state  holi-
 day,  such registration shall be valid for the operation of such vehicle
 until midnight of the next day on which state offices shall be open  for

 business.  Provided, however, that renewal of a registration may be used
 preceding the expiration date of such registration including such  expi-
 ration  date.  Provided, further, however, that where the required proof
 of  registration  consists of an expired registration for the same vehi-
 cle, issued to the same person applying for the registration or renewal,
 and the expired registration certificate and number plates and date tags
 issued for such registration had not been surrendered to the commission-
 er on or before the expiration date of such  registration,  the  commis-
 sioner  may  in  his discretion deem such application to be a renewal of
 the expired registration and require that the fee paid for  such  regis-
 tration  be  computed  as if the registration had been made prior to the
 date of expiration of the expired registration.
  b. The fee for the renewal of a registration shall be the same as  the
 annual  registration  fee, and, where a registration or renewal is for a
 period of more or less than  one  calendar  year,  the  annual  fees  as
 provided  in  this section shall be increased or reduced proportionately
 on a daily computation basis, except that where the annual  registration
 fee  for such vehicle would amount to ten dollars or less, the fee shall
 not be so prorated.
  c.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this article,  the  commis-
 sioner  shall  issue  registrations  [and renewals of registrations] for
 motor vehicles for which a registration fee established in  paragraph  a
 of  subdivision six of this section is required to be paid and for motor
 vehicles having a maximum gross weight of not more than  eighteen  thou-
 sand pounds for which a registration fee established in paragraph one of
 schedule  B  of subdivision seven of this section is required to be paid
 [for a period of not less than two years]. THE INITIAL REGISTRATION OF A
 NEW MODEL YEAR MOTOR VEHICLE FOR WHICH A REGISTRATION FEE ESTABLISHED IN
 PARAGRAPH A OF SUBDIVISION SIX OF THIS SECTION IS REQUIRED AND FOR A NEW
 MODEL YEAR MOTOR VEHICLE HAVING A MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT OF NOT MORE  THAN
 EIGHTEEN  THOUSAND  POUNDS  FOR  WHICH A REGISTRATION FEE ESTABLISHED IN
 PARAGRAPH ONE OF SCHEDULE B OF SUBDIVISION  SEVEN  OF  THIS  SECTION  IS
 REQUIRED TO BE PAID SHALL NOT EXPIRE UNTIL THE TITLE OF SUCH MOTOR VEHI-
 CLE  IS  TRANSFERRED  TO A NEW OWNER AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE FORTY-SIX OF
 THIS CHAPTER. THE REGISTRATION OF ANY SUCH OLDER MODEL YEAR MOTOR  VEHI-
 CLES  THAT  ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED SHALL NOT EXPIRE UNTIL THE TITLE OF
 SUCH MOTOR VEHICLE IS TRANSFERRED TO A NEW OWNER AS PROVIDED IN  ARTICLE
 FORTY-SIX  OF THIS CHAPTER. UPON SUCH TRANSFER OF A CERTIFICATE OF TITLE
 THE NEW OWNER SHALL REGISTER THE MOTOR VEHICLE AND PAY THE  REGISTRATION
 FEE ESTABLISHED IN PARAGRAPH A OF SUBDIVISION SIX OR IN PARAGRAPH ONE OF
 SCHEDULE  B  OF SUBDIVISION SEVEN OF THIS SECTION. In addition, the full
 amount of any other charges, taxes or fees [which would be  required  to
 be  paid  to, or collected by, the commissioner during the entire regis-
 tration period if registrations were issued for  twelve  month  periods]
 shall  be  paid to the commissioner at the time of such registration [or
 renewal of registration. The commissioner  shall  promulgate  rules  and
 regulations  for  the  issuance  of  registration  renewals  extended as
 required in this paragraph. However, such regulations may  provide  that
 the  initial  issuance  of  extended renewals be accomplished over a two
 year  period.  The  commissioner  may  by  regulation  exempt  from  the
 provisions  of this paragraph registrations for motor vehicles issued in
 conjunction with any  long-term  registration  program  or  registration
 reciprocity  or  proration agreement which this state has established or
 to which this state is a party].
  5-a. Denial of registration [or renewal].  a. (i) If at  the  time  of
 application  for  a registration [or renewal] thereof there is a certif-

 standing, or that such motor vehicle was operated for hire by the regis-
 trant  or his or her agent without being licensed as a motor vehicle for
 hire by the appropriate local authority, in  violation  of  any  of  the
 provisions  of this chapter or of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation

 in accordance with article twenty-four of this  chapter;  or  (iii)  the
 registrant  was liable for a violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (f)

 to comply with such bus lane restrictions through the  installation  and
 operation  of bus lane photo devices, in accordance with article twenty-
 four of this chapter; or (v) the registrant was liable for  a  violation
 of  section  eleven  hundred seventy-four of this chapter when meeting a

 imposed pursuant to a local law or ordinance imposing monetary liability

 tion of school bus photo violation  monitoring  systems,  in  accordance
 with  article  twenty-nine  of  this chapter; or (vi) the registrant was
 liable for a violation of section  three  hundred  eighty-five  of  this

 imposing  monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an
 operator thereof to comply with such gross vehicle  weight  and/or  axle
 weight  restrictions  through the installation and operation of weigh in
 motion violation monitoring systems, in accordance with article  ten  of
 this  chapter;  or  (vii)  the  registrant was liable for a violation of
 subdivision (b), (d), (f) or (g) of section  eleven  hundred  eighty  of
 this  chapter imposed pursuant to a demonstration program imposing mone-
 tary liability on the owner of a vehicle  for  failure  of  an  operator

 A. 4221  4
 
 shall deny the registration [or renewal] application until the applicant
 provides  proof from the court, traffic and parking violations agency or
 administrative tribunal wherein the charges are pending that an  appear-
 ance  or answer has been made or in the case of an administrative tribu-
 nal that he or she has complied with the rules and regulations  of  said
 tribunal  following  entry  of a final decision. Where an application is
 denied pursuant to this section, the commissioner may,  in  his  or  her
 discretion,  deny  a  registration [or renewal] application to any other
 person for the same vehicle and may deny  a  registration  [or  renewal]
 application  for  any  other motor vehicle registered in the name of the
 applicant where the commissioner has determined that  such  registrant's
 intent  has been to evade the purposes of this subdivision and where the
 commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe  that  such  registration
 [or  renewal]  will  have  the  effect of defeating the purposes of this
 subdivision. Such denial shall only remain in  effect  as  long  as  the
 summonses  remain unanswered, or in the case of an administrative tribu-
 nal, the registrant fails to  comply  with  the  rules  and  regulations
 following entry of a final decision.
  (ii)  For purposes of this paragraph, the term "motor vehicle operated
 for hire" shall mean and include a taxicab, livery, coach, limousine  or
 tow truck.
  b.  If at the time of application by any person for a registration [or
 renewal thereof] there is a certification from a court or an  agency  or
 administrative  tribunal  with regulatory or adjudicatory authority over
 van services or other such common carriers of  passengers  in  any  city
 with  a  population  of over one million pursuant to subdivision five of
 section eighty of the transportation law that  there  remains  unpaid  a
 penalty  imposed  by  such  agency  or  administrative tribunal or court
 following entry of a decision or order, including a decision or order in
 a proceeding in which there has been a failure  to  appear  or  pay,  in
 response  to  a  notice  of  violation,  summons or other process issued
 charging that the vehicle was operated as a van service  or  other  such
 common carrier of passengers without the operating authority required by
 such  local  law  or  ordinance,  the commissioner or the commissioner's
 agent shall impose a vehicle identification number block  and  deny  the
 registration [or renewal] application until the applicant provides proof
 from  the  court  or agency or other administrative tribunal wherein the
 charges were adjudicated that such penalty has been paid in full or  the
 violation  has  been corrected to its satisfaction. Where an application
 is denied pursuant to this  paragraph,  the  commissioner  may,  in  the
 commissioner's  discretion, deny a registration [or renewal] application
 for any other motor vehicle registered in  the  name  of  the  applicant
 where  the commissioner has determined that such registrant's intent has
 been to evade the purposes of this paragraph and where the  commissioner
 has  reasonable  grounds  to believe that such registration [or renewal]
 will have the effect of defeating the purposes of this  paragraph.  Such
 vehicle  identification  number  block  and  denial shall only remain in
 effect until the penalty has been paid in full or the violation has been
 corrected to the satisfaction of the court, city agency  or  administra-
 tive tribunal.
  c.  The  commissioner may promulgate such regulations as are necessary
 to effectuate the provisions of this subdivision,  including  provisions
 for the recovery of the administrative costs of the program incurred for
 each  municipality.  The  commissioner may, in his discretion, refuse to
 process a certification received from a court or administrative tribunal
 in any municipality which has failed to comply with  the  provisions  of
 A. 4221  5
 
 section  five hundred fourteen of this chapter or which does not have an
 effective program for enforcing suspension and revocation orders  issued
 by the department.

 cle and traffic law to the contrary, payment of the tax with respect  to
 a  motor  vehicle  described in subdivision a of this section shall be a
 condition precedent to the registration [or  renewal  thereof]  of  such
 motor vehicle and to the issuance of any certificate of registration and
 plates  or removable date tag in accordance with the vehicle and traffic
 law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,  and  no  such
 certificate  of  registration, plates or tag shall be issued unless such
 tax has been paid. If the registration period  applicable  to  any  such
 vehicle  is  a  period  of  not  less than two years, as a result of the
 application of the provisions of paragraph  c  of  subdivision  five  of
 section  four  hundred  one  of  the  vehicle  and  traffic law, the tax
 required to be paid pursuant to this section shall  be  the  annual  tax
 specified  in section 11-802 of this chapter multiplied by the number of
 years in the registration period. The commissioner  of  motor  vehicles,
 upon payment of the tax pursuant to this section or upon the application
 of  any  person  exempt therefrom, shall furnish to each taxpayer paying
 the tax a receipt for such tax and to  each  other  taxpayer  or  exempt
 person a statement, document or other form prescribed by the commission-
 er  of motor vehicles, showing that such tax has been paid or is not due
 with respect to such motor vehicle.
  h. Notwithstanding any provision of section 11-807 of this chapter  to
 the  contrary,  at  the time a tax is required to be paid to the commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section, the  person  required
 to pay such tax shall file a return with the commissioner of motor vehi-
 cles  in  such  form  and  containing  such information as he or she may
 prescribe. The taxpayer's application for registration [or  the  renewal
 thereof]  shall  constitute  the  return required under this subdivision
 unless the commissioner of motor vehicles  shall  otherwise  provide  by
 rule.  A  return  filed  pursuant  to this subdivision with respect to a
 motor vehicle for a tax year or years shall be in  lieu  of  any  return
 A. 4221  10
 
 otherwise  required to be filed with respect thereto pursuant to section
 11-807 of this chapter.
  §  9.  Paragraphs  a  and b of subdivision 1 of section 11-2202 of the
 administrative code of the city of New  York  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  a.  Upon  each  individual resident for each such motor vehicle regis-
 tered or for which registration is [renewed, or] required to  be  regis-
 tered [or renewed] by him or her; and
  b. Upon each other resident of each such motor vehicle regularly kept,
 stored,  garaged or maintained in the city and registered or required to
 be registered [or renewed] by such other resident; and
  § 10. Section 11-2204 of the administrative code of the  city  of  New
 York is amended to read as follows:
  § 11-2204 Payment of tax and evidence of tax payment. Every owner of a
 motor  vehicle subject to tax hereunder shall pay the tax thereon to the
 commissioner of motor vehicles of the state of New York on or before the
 date upon which he or she registers [or renews his or  her  registration
 thereof]  or  is  required to register [or renew his or her registration
 thereof] pursuant to section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic
 law.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of section four hundred of the  vehicle
 and  traffic  law  to  the  contrary, the payment of such tax shall be a
 condition precedent to the registration [or  renewal  thereof]  of  such
 motor vehicle and to the issuance of any certificate of registration and
 plates  or  removable tag specified in subdivision three of section four
 hundred one and in sections four hundred three and four hundred four  of
 the  vehicle  and  traffic law, and no such certificate of registration,
 plates or tag shall be issued unless such tax has been paid. The commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles shall not issue a registration certificate  for
 any  motor vehicle for which the registrant's address is within any such
 city, except upon proof, in a form approved by the commissioner of motor
 vehicles, that such tax has been paid, or is not due,  with  respect  to
 such motor vehicle. The commissioner of motor vehicles, upon the payment
 of  such  tax  or  upon  the application of any person exempt therefrom,
 shall furnish to each taxpayer paying the tax a receipt for such tax and
 to each such taxpayer or exempt person a statement,  document  or  other
 form approved by the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to the last
 sentence,  showing  that  such  tax  has  been  paid or is not due, with
 respect to such motor vehicle.
  § 11. Subdivision j of section 19-506 of the  administrative  code  of
 the  city  of  New York, as added by local law number 115 of the city of
 New York for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  j. Where the commission or administrative tribunal  thereof  finds  an
 owner  liable  for  operating  a  vehicle  as  a commuter van without an
 authorization to operate a commuter van service or  without  a  commuter
 van  license,  the  commission shall notify the [New York state] commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles pursuant to subparagraph four of paragraph a of
 subdivision five of section eighty of the [New York  state]  transporta-
 tion  law  of  such finding. Upon such notification, the commissioner of
 motor vehicles, pursuant to  such  subparagraph  four,  shall  thereupon
 suspend  the registration of such vehicle and shall deny any application
 for the registration of such vehicle [or any application for the renewal
 thereof] pursuant to subdivision five-a of section four hundred  one  of
 the  vehicle  and traffic law until such time as the commission may give
 notice that the violation has been corrected to its satisfaction.  Oper-
 ation of any motor vehicle for which the registration has been suspended
 A. 4221  11
 
 as herein provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.  The  commis-
 sion shall also notify the department of finance where it finds an owner
 liable  for  operating  a  vehicle as a commuter van without an authori-
 zation  to  operate  a  commuter  van  service or without a commuter van
 license.
  § 12. Subsection (g) of section 9110 of the insurance law, as added by

  § 13. Subdivision (g) of section 1201 of the tax law,  as  amended  by
 chapter  402 of the laws of 1971, paragraphs 1 and 2 as amended by chap-
 ter 576 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  (g) A tax not to exceed fifteen dollars per annum per  vehicle  to  be
 paid  by  the  owner  thereof: (1) for every motor vehicle registered or
 required to be registered pursuant to subdivision six  of  section  four
 hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law if such vehicle is owned by
  (i)  one  or  more natural persons, other than a firm, co-partnership,
 limited liability company, trustee or trustees conducting a business  or
 association, who, or one of whom: (A) at the time when he makes applica-
 tion  for the registration[, re-registration or renewal thereof] of such
 motor vehicle is domiciled in the city, unless he maintains no permanent
 place of abode in the city, maintains a permanent place of  abode  else-
 where,  and  during  the period of one year next preceding the date upon
 which such application is made, spent in the  aggregate  not  more  than
 thirty  days in the city, or (B) at the time when he makes such applica-
 tion, is not domiciled in the city, but maintains a permanent  place  of
 abode  in the city and, during the period of one year next preceding the
 date upon which such application is made, spent in  the  aggregate  more
 than one hundred and eighty-three days in the city, unless such individ-
 ual is in the armed forces of the United States; or
  (ii)  a person, firm, co-partnership, limited liability company, trus-
 tee or trustees conducting a business or association, or  a  corporation
 who or which at the time when such owner makes application for registra-
 tion[,  re-registration or renewal thereof] of such motor vehicle, regu-
 larly keeps, stores, garages or maintains  such  motor  vehicle  in  the
 city; and
  (2)  for  every  motor  vehicle  owned by a person, firm, partnership,
 limited liability company, association or  corporation  engaged  in  the
 business  of  renting  or leasing motor vehicles to be operated upon the
 public highways for carrying passengers registered  or  required  to  be
 registered  pursuant to any provision of section four hundred one of the
 vehicle and traffic law, which vehicle at the time when such owner makes
 application for registration[, re-registration or  renewal  thereof]  is
 regularly kept, stored, garaged or maintained in the city including such
 vehicles  which  have  been  rented  or  leased  by the owner and are in
 possession of lessees when such application for registration[, re-regis-
 tration or renewal] is made.
  (3) The payment of such tax shall be a condition  [precendent]  PRECE-
 DENT  to  the  registration[, re-registration or renewal therof] of such
 motor vehicle and to the issuance of any certificate of registration and
 plates or removable date tag specified in subdivision three  of  section
 four  hundred  one  and  in sections four hundred three and four hundred
 four of the vehicle and traffic law, and no such certificate  of  regis-
 tration,  plates  or  tag shall be issued unless such tax has been paid.
 The commissioner of  motor  vehicles  shall  not  issue  a  registration
 A. 4221  12
 
 certificate  for any motor vehicle for which the registrant's address is
 within any such city, except upon proof,  in  a  form  approved  by  the
 commissioner  of motor vehicles, that such tax, if imposed by such city,
 has been paid, or is not due, with respect to such motor vehicle.
  §  14. Subparagraph 4 of paragraph a of subdivision 5 of section 80 of
 the transportation law, as amended by chapter 487 of the laws  of  1993,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (4)  Such  local law or ordinance shall provide that where such agency
 or administrative tribunal finds an owner liable for operating a vehicle
 as a van service or other such  common  carrier  without  the  operating
 authority required by such local law or ordinance, such agency or admin-
 istrative tribunal may notify the commissioner of motor vehicles of such
 finding and the commissioner shall thereupon suspend the registration of
 such vehicle and shall deny any application for the registration of such
 vehicle  [or any application for the renewal thereof] pursuant to subdi-
 vision five-a of section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law
 until such time as such  agency  or  administrative  tribunal  may  give
 notice  that  the  violation has been corrected to its satisfaction. The
 procedure on any such suspension shall be the same as in the case  of  a
 suspension  under  the  vehicle  and traffic law. Operation of any motor
 vehicle for which the registration has been suspended as herein provided
 shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.
  § 15. Paragraph a and subparagraph (i) of paragraph b of subdivision 9
 of section 140 of the transportation law,  paragraph  a  as  amended  by
 section  3  of  part III of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, and subpara-
 graph (i) of paragraph b as amended by chapter 9 of the  laws  of  2020,
 are amended to read as follows:
  a.  If,  after  notice  and  opportunity to be heard, the commissioner
 shall find that any person is operating in violation of  the  provisions
 of  this  section, the commissioner may penalize such person pursuant to
 subdivision three of section one hundred forty-five of this article. The
 commissioner may also notify the commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  that
 such  person  is  operating in violation of this section and the commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles shall thereupon suspend the registration of all
 motor vehicles owned or operated by such person, with the  exception  of
 private  passenger  automobiles, until such time as the commissioner may
 give notice that the violation has been satisfactorily adjusted, and the
 commissioner of motor vehicles may direct any police officer  to  secure
 possession of the number plates of such motor vehicles and to return the
 same  to the commissioner of motor vehicles. Failure of the holder or of
 any person possessing such number plates to deliver such  number  plates
 to any police officer who requests the same pursuant to this subdivision
 shall constitute a misdemeanor. The commissioner of motor vehicles shall
 have  the  authority  to deny a registration [or renewal] application to
 any other person for the same vehicle and may deny  a  registration  [or
 renewal]  application for any other motor vehicle registered in the name
 of the applicant where it has been  determined  that  such  registrant's
 intent  has been to evade the purposes of this subdivision and where the
 commissioner of motor vehicles has reasonable grounds  to  believe  that
 such  registration  [or  renewal]  will have the effect of defeating the
 purposes of this subdivision. The procedure on any such suspension shall
 be the same as in the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic
 law. Operation of any motor vehicle while  under  suspension  as  herein
 provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. A person who operates a
 motor vehicle while such vehicle is under suspension as provided in this
 subdivision in a manner that causes the death of another person, knowing
 A. 4221  13
 
 that  the operation of such vehicle is in violation of this subdivision,
 shall be guilty of a class E felony.
  (i)  Whenever  an  altered  motor  vehicle  commonly  referred to as a
 "stretch limousine" has failed an inspection and been placed out-of-ser-
 vice, the commissioner may direct a police officer or his or  her  agent
 to  immediately  secure  possession of the number plates of such vehicle
 and return the same to the commissioner of motor vehicles.  The  commis-
 sioner  shall  notify the commissioner of motor vehicles to that effect,
 and the commissioner of  motor  vehicles  shall  thereupon  suspend  the
 registration  of  such vehicle until such time as the commissioner gives
 notice that the out-of-service defect has been satisfactorily  adjusted.
 Provided, however, that the commissioner shall give notice and an oppor-
 tunity  to  be heard within not more than thirty days of the suspension.
 Failure of the holder or of any person possessing such plates to deliver
 to the commissioner or his or her agent who requests the  same  pursuant
 to  this  paragraph  shall  be  a misdemeanor. The commissioner of motor
 vehicles shall have the authority to deny a  registration  [or  renewal]
 application  to  any other person for the same vehicle where it has been
 determined that such registrant's intent has been to evade the  purposes
 of  this  paragraph  and  where  the  commissioner of motor vehicles has
 reasonable grounds to believe that such registration [or  renewal]  will
 have  the effect of defeating the purposes of this paragraph. The proce-
 dure on any such suspension shall be the  same  as  in  the  case  of  a
 suspension  under  the vehicle and traffic law.  Operation of such motor
 vehicle while under suspension as provided  in  this  subdivision  shall
 constitute a class A misdemeanor.
  § 16. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 318 of the vehicle and
 traffic  law,  as amended by chapter 781 of the laws of 1983, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (c) Suspension shall not be made under this subdivision upon the basis
 of a lapse or termination of insurance if the  registration  certificate
 and number plates of the motor vehicle are surrendered prior to the time
 at  which the termination of insurance becomes effective. Such surrender
 shall be made to such officers of the  department  as  the  commissioner
 shall  direct, but the registrant at his option may surrender the regis-
 tration and number plates to any county clerk who is acting as an  agent
 of  the  commissioner pursuant to section two hundred five of this chap-
 ter. Such county clerk may accept a surrender of registration and number
 plates and require the payment of a  fee  of  one  dollar  whether  such
 surrender  is  made before or after the effective date of termination of
 insurance. The county clerk shall retain any such  fee  which  may  have
 been  collected,  and  shall  return  such registration certificates and
 number plates, or dispose of the same, only as prescribed by the commis-
 sioner. For the purposes of this section the expiration of  a  registra-
 tion  [without  renewal  of  such  registration] shall be deemed to be a
 surrender of registration as of the date of expiration.
  § 17. Subdivision 2 of section 404 of the vehicle and traffic law,  as
 amended  by  section  22 of part G of chapter 59 of the laws of 2009, is
 amended to read as follows:
  2. For purposes of this section, a special number  plate  shall  be  a
 plate which contains not more than eight letters, numerals or any combi-
 nation thereof and which is reserved by the commissioner for issuance in
 accordance  with the provisions of this section, or a plate reserved for
 issuance in a series for vehicles owned by public officers,  physicians,
 visiting  nurses,  accredited  representatives  of  the  press  or other
 groups. In issuing special number plates  the  commissioner  shall  give
 A. 4221  14
 
 those  applicants  who  held  a  special number plate at the time of the
 enactment of this section the right to retain such special number  plate
 upon  the payment of the annual service charge of thirty-one dollars and
 twenty-five  cents.  [Provided,  however,  that  such right of retention
 shall apply only to the  first  renewal  of  the  registration  of  such
 special  number plate following the enactment of this section.] Notwith-
 standing any inconsistent provision  of  this  section,  the  difference
 collected  between  the annual service charge set forth in this subdivi-
 sion in effect on and after September first, two thousand nine  and  the
 annual  service  charge set forth in this subdivision in effect prior to
 such date shall be deposited to the credit of the dedicated highway  and
 bridge trust fund.
  §  18.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 5 of section 404-a of the vehicle
 and traffic law, as amended by chapter 376  of  the  laws  of  2015,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (b)  The  commissioner  may  require the applicant for registration to
 furnish such proof of his or her disability or such proof of  disability
 of such members of his or her family from a physician, physician assist-
 ant  or nurse practitioner, to the extent authorized by law and consist-
 ent with subdivision three of section six thousand nine hundred  two  of
 the  education law, or podiatrist pursuant to subdivision four-a of this
 section or optometrist pursuant to subdivision four-b of  this  section,
 as  the commissioner deems necessary [either] for [initial] registration
 [or renewal thereof]; provided, however, that a handicapped or  disabled
 permit  issued  by  a municipality to such applicant pursuant to section
 twelve hundred three-a of this chapter shall be deemed sufficient  proof
 of disability for purposes of this paragraph.
  §  19.  Subdivision 7 of section 404-a of the vehicle and traffic law,
 as added by chapter 332 of the laws of  2000,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  7.  Refueling notice. Upon the issuance [or renewal] of a registration
 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify  the  registrant
 of  the  availability  of  full  service motor vehicle refueling at self
 service prices as provided for in section three hundred ninety-six-bb of
 the general business law.
  § 20. Subdivision 5 of section 404-c of the vehicle and  traffic  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  485 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as
 follows:
  5. Notwithstanding subdivision three of  this  section  and  the  fees
 prescribed  or  permitted  by  section four hundred one of this article,
 there shall be no charge for the issuance of a number plate pursuant  to
 this  section to a former prisoner of war, nor shall there be imposed an
 additional service charge for the issuance of such a  plate  to  such  a
 person.  Furthermore,  upon the issuance of a distinctive plate pursuant
 to this section, such a former prisoner of war shall be exempt from  the
 payment of any fees relating to the registration [or renewal thereof] as
 prescribed by section four hundred one of this article.
  §  21.  Section  499-b  of  the  vehicle  and traffic law, as added by
 section 1 of part B of chapter 25 of the laws of  2009,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  §  499-b.  Collection  of  supplemental  fee. All registrants of motor
 vehicles who reside in the metropolitan commuter transportation district
 shall pay to the commissioner or  his  or  her  agent  the  supplemental
 registration  fee  provided  for  in  this article upon registration [or
 renewal] of motor vehicles subject to registration fees pursuant to  the
 following  sections  of  this chapter: paragraph a of subdivision six of
 A. 4221  15
 
 section four hundred one; schedules A, B, C, E, F, G, I and K of  subdi-
 vision  seven  of  section  four hundred one; paragraph a of subdivision
 eight of section four hundred one; paragraph a of  subdivision  five  of
 section four hundred ten; and section four hundred eleven-b.
  §  22.  Subparagraph  (iii) of paragraph b of subdivision 2 of section
 510 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by section 1 of part A of
 chapter 58 of the laws of 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  (iii) such registrations shall be suspended when necessary  to  comply
 with  subdivision  nine of section one hundred forty or subdivision four
 of section one hundred forty-five of the transportation law or  with  an
 out of service order issued by the United States department of transpor-
 tation. The commissioner shall have the authority to deny a registration
 [or  renewal]  application  to any other person for the same vehicle and
 may deny a registration [or renewal] application  for  any  other  motor
 vehicle registered in the name of the applicant where it has been deter-
 mined  that  such  registrant's intent has been to evade the purposes of
 this subdivision and where the commissioner has  reasonable  grounds  to
 believe  that  such  registration  [or  renewal] will have the effect of
 defeating the purposes of this subdivision. Any suspension issued pursu-
 ant to this subdivision by reason of an out of service order  issued  by
 the  United  States  department of transportation shall remain in effect
 until such time as the commissioner is notified  by  the  United  States
 department  of transportation or the commissioner of transportation that
 the order resulting in the suspension is no longer in effect.
  § 23. Subdivision 4-g of section 510 of the vehicle and  traffic  law,
 as  added  by  section 3 of part H of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is
 amended to read as follows:
  4-g. Suspension of registration for unlawful  solicitation  of  ground
 transportation  services  at an airport. Upon the receipt of a notifica-
 tion from a court or an administrative tribunal that an owner of a motor
 vehicle was convicted of a second conviction of unlawful solicitation of
 ground transportation services at an airport in violation of subdivision
 one of section twelve hundred twenty-b of this  chapter  both  of  which
 were  committed  within a period of eighteen months, the commissioner or
 his agent shall suspend the registration of the vehicle involved in  the
 violation  for a period of ninety days; upon the receipt of such notifi-
 cation of a third or subsequent  conviction  for  a  violation  of  such
 subdivision  all  of  which  were  committed within a period of eighteen
 months, the commissioner or his agent shall  suspend  such  registration
 for  a  period  of  one  hundred eighty days. Such suspension shall take
 effect no less than thirty days from the date on which notice thereof is
 sent by the commissioner to the person whose registration  or  privilege
 is suspended. The commissioner shall have the authority to deny a regis-
 tration  [or renewal] application to any other person for the same vehi-
 cle, where it has been determined that such registrant's intent has been
 to evade the purposes of this subdivision and where the commissioner has
 reasonable grounds to believe that such registration [or  renewal]  will
 have the effect of defeating the purposes of this subdivision.
  §  24. Subdivision 7 of section 510 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 amended by section 5 of part K of chapter 59 of the  laws  of  2010,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  7.  Miscellaneous  provisions.  Except  as expressly provided, a court
 conviction shall not be necessary to sustain a revocation or suspension.
 Revocation or suspension hereunder shall be deemed an administrative act
 reviewable by the supreme court as such. Notice of revocation or suspen-
 sion, as well as any required notice of hearing, where the holder is not
 A. 4221  16

 present, may be given by mailing the same in writing to him  or  her  at
 the address contained in his or her license, certificate of registration
 or  at the current address provided by the United States postal service,
 as the case may be. Proof of such mailing by certified mail to the hold-
 er  shall  be  presumptive  evidence  of the holder's receipt and actual
 knowledge of such notice. Attendance of witnesses may  be  compelled  by
 subpoena.  Failure  of  the  holder  or  any other person possessing the
 license card or number plates, to deliver the same to the suspending  or
 revoking officer is a misdemeanor. Suspending or revoking officers shall
 place such license cards and number plates in the custody of the commis-
 sioner  except  where  the  commissioner  shall otherwise direct. If any
 person shall fail to deliver a license card or number plates as provided
 herein, any police officer, bridge and tunnel officer of the  Triborough
 bridge  and  tunnel authority, or agent of the commissioner having know-
 ledge of such facts shall have the power to  secure  possession  thereof
 and return the same to the commissioner, and the commissioner may forth-
 with direct any police officer, bridge and tunnel officer of the Tribor-
 ough  bridge and tunnel authority, acting pursuant to his or her special
 duties, or agent of the commissioner to secure possession thereof and to
 return the same to the commissioner.  Failure of the holder  or  of  any
 person  possessing  the  license card or number plates to deliver to any
 police officer, bridge and tunnel officer of the Triborough  bridge  and
 tunnel  authority,  or  agent  of the commissioner who requests the same
 pursuant to this subdivision shall be a misdemeanor. Notice  of  revoca-
 tion  or  suspension of any license or registration shall be transmitted
 forthwith by the commissioner to the chief of  police  of  the  city  or
 prosecuting officer of the locality in which the person whose license or
 registration  so  revoked  or suspended resides. [In case any license or
 registration shall expire before the end of any period for which it  has
 been  revoked  or  suspended,  and before it shall have been restored as
 provided in this chapter, then and in that event any renewal thereof may
 be withheld until the end of such period of suspension or until restora-
 tion, as the case may be.]
  The revocation of a learner's permit shall  automatically  cancel  the
 application for a license of the holder of such permit.
  No suspension or revocation of a license or registration shall be made
 because  of a judgment of conviction if the suspending or revoking offi-
 cer is satisfied that the magistrate who pronounced the judgment  failed
 to comply with subdivision one of section eighteen hundred seven of this
 chapter.  In  case  a  suspension  or  revocation  has been made and the
 commissioner is satisfied that there was such failure, the  commissioner
 shall restore the license or registration or both as the case may be.
  §  25.  Paragraphs  (b) and (c) of subdivision 4 of section 514 of the
 vehicle and traffic law, paragraph (b) as amended by chapter 163 of  the
 laws  of  2008, and paragraph (c) as added by chapter 164 of the laws of
 1970, are amended to read as follows:
  (b) Upon such certification, the trial court, the  clerk  thereof,  or
 the  administrative tribunal shall notify the registrant by certified or
 registered mail, return receipt requested, that the  commissioner  shall
 deny  the  registration  [or  renewal]  application until proof from the
 court wherein the charges were pending is provided to  the  commissioner
 by  such  court, administrative tribunal, or registrant that such regis-
 trant has answered or appeared, or in  the  case  of  an  administrative
 tribunal provides proof that such registrant has complied with the rules
 and  regulations  of  said tribunal following entry of a final decision.
 Thereafter and upon the appearance or  answer  of  any  such  person  in
 A. 4221  17
 
 response to such summonses the trial court or clerk thereof shall forth-
 with  certify  that fact to the registrant, and to the commissioner in a
 manner and form prescribed by the commissioner. In the case of an admin-
 istrative  tribunal  such  certification shall be made to the registrant
 and to the commissioner upon compliance with the rules  and  regulations
 of  such tribunal. Provided, however, that proof provided to the commis-
 sioner by a registrant in the form of a certification provided  to  such
 registrant  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall have the same effect as
 proof provided to the  commissioner  by  such  court  or  administrative
 tribunal.
  [(c)  At least sixty days prior to renewal date the commissioner shall
 notify the registrant that unless he complies  with  the  provisions  of
 this  section  as  set forth above, his registration or renewal thereof,
 will be denied.]
  § 26. Subdivision 3 of section 2261 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 added by chapter 869 of the laws of 1976, paragraph (b)  as  amended  by
 section  19  of  part G of chapter 59 of the laws of 2009, is amended to
 read as follows:
  3. Fees. (a) The fees for the registration[, renewal,  reregistration]
 or  amendment or duplicate of a registration of a limited use automobile
 shall be the same fees as if such vehicle were  registered  pursuant  to
 section four hundred one of this chapter.
  (b)  The annual fee for the registration[, renewal, reregistration] or
 amendment or duplicate of a registration of  a  limited  use  motorcycle
 shall  be  six dollars and twenty-five cents. Any such registration will
 commence and expire on dates to be determined by the commissioner. A fee
 for a registration for periods of more or less than one year  shall  not
 be prorated.
  §  27.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately  the  addition,
 amendment  and/or  repeal  of  any  rule or regulation necessary for the
 implementation of this act on its effective date are  authorized  to  be
 made and completed on or before such date.
