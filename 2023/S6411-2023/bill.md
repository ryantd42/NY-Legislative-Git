 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation  to  awarding  attorneys'
  fees  and  costs  and  exemplary  damages  in an action brought for an
  unlawful discriminatory practice

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  9  of  section  297 of the executive law, as
 amended by chapter 140 of the laws  of  2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  9.  Any  person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory
 practice shall have a cause of action in any court of appropriate juris-
 diction for damages, including, in cases  of  employment  discrimination
 related  to  private employers and housing discrimination only, punitive
 damages, and  UPON PREVAILING, SHALL RECOVER REASONABLE ATTORNEYS'  FEES
 AND COSTS IN THE ACTION. IN ADDITION THERETO THE TRIER OF FACT MAY AWARD
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND such other remedies as may be appropriate, includ-
 ing  any  civil fines and penalties provided in subdivision four of this
 section, unless such person had filed a complaint hereunder or with  any
 local commission on human rights, or with the superintendent pursuant to
 the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred ninety-six-a of this article,
 provided that, where the division has dismissed such  complaint  on  the
 grounds  of  administrative convenience, on the grounds of untimeliness,
 or on the grounds that the election of remedies is annulled, such person
 shall maintain all rights to bring suit as  if  no  complaint  had  been
 filed with the division. At any time prior to a hearing before a hearing
 examiner,  a  person  who  has  a  complaint pending at the division may
 request that the division dismiss the complaint and  annul  his  or  her
 election  of  remedies so that the human rights law claim may be pursued
 in court, and the division may, upon such request, dismiss the complaint

 on the grounds that such person's election of an  administrative  remedy
 is annulled. Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of section two hundred four
 of  the  civil  practice law and rules, if a complaint is so annulled by
 the  division,  upon  the  request  of the party bringing such complaint
 before the division, such party's rights to bring such cause  of  action
 before a court of appropriate jurisdiction shall be limited by the stat-
 ute of limitations in effect in such court at the time the complaint was
 initially filed with the division. Any party to a housing discrimination
 complaint  shall  have the right within twenty days following a determi-
 nation of probable cause pursuant to subdivision two of this section  to
 elect  to  have  an  action  commenced in a civil court, and an attorney
 representing the division of human rights will be appointed  to  present
 the  complaint  in court, or, with the consent of the division, the case
 may be presented by complainant's attorney. A  complaint  filed  by  the
 equal  employment opportunity commission to comply with the requirements
 of 42 USC 2000e-5(c) and 42 USC 12117(a) and 29  USC  633(b)  shall  not
 constitute the filing of a complaint within the meaning of this subdivi-
 sion.  No  person  who  has initiated any action in a court of competent
 jurisdiction or who has an  action  pending  before  any  administrative
 agency under any other law of the state based upon an act which would be
 an  unlawful  discriminatory  practice  under  this  article, may file a
 complaint with respect to the same grievance under this section or under
 section two hundred ninety-six-a of this article. In  cases  of  housing
 discrimination  only, a person whose complaint has been dismissed by the
 division after investigation for lack of jurisdiction or lack of  proba-
 ble  cause  may  file the same cause of action in a court of appropriate
 jurisdiction pursuant to this section, unless judicial  review  of  such
 dismissal  has  been sought pursuant to section two hundred ninety-eight
 of this article. The attorney general shall have the power  to  commence
 an  action  or proceeding in the supreme court of the state of New York,
 if, upon information or belief, the attorney general is of  the  opinion
 that  an  employer  has  been, is, or is about to violate the provisions
 regarding unlawful discriminatory retaliation  pursuant  to  subdivision
 seven of section two hundred ninety-six of this article. Nothing in this
 section  shall  in  any way limit rights or remedies which are otherwise
 available under law to the attorney general or any other person  author-
 ized to bring an action under this section.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
