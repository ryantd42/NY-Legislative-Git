  HONORING Pellegrini Vineyards upon the occasion of
  its  designation  as a Gold Medalist by the New York
  Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Pellegrini Vineyards upon the occasion of  its  designation  as  a  Gold
Medalist  by  the  New York Wine and Grape Foundation at its 36th Annual
New York Wine Classic on Tuesday, July 12, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 36th Annual New  York  Wine  Classic  is  a  nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years and
allowing wine enthusiasts to enjoy this unique  part  of  the  New  York
experience  across  the  state,  this  extraordinary  Vineyard has truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pellegrini Vineyards was awarded for  its  2015  Unfiltered
Petit Verdot, 2019 Sauvignon Blanc, 2019 Vintner's Pride Chardonnay, and
2020 East End Select BBQ Red, Petit Verdo; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pellegrini  Vineyards  was  founded  by  Bob  and  Joyce
Pellegrini; they opened a 14,000 square foot winery complex in 1991, and
are considered one of the original pioneers  in  the  Long  Island  wine
community  for  their  integration of the wine making process into their
facility; and
 
  WHEREAS, The winery is an architecturally striking two story tasting
room bolstered by oak posts and hand-hewn  beams;  a  trellised  walkway
connects  it  to  the  spacious  and  modern  production  facility where
visitors can watch the wine making process; and
 
  WHEREAS, The upstairs of the winery is a private tasting  area  with
spectacular  panoramic  views of the winery's centerpiece, its courtyard
which features a classic Italian cloister design; this  state-of-the-art
facility  combines  the  best of modern winemaking technology, yet still
honors Bob Pellegrini's design passion for Old World traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Pellegrini  Vineyards  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its dedicated owners and staff, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
 
excellence in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  businesses  and  the
communities they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident it will  continue  to  enjoy  the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Pellegrini Vineyards upon the occasion of  its  designation  as  a
Gold  Medalist  by  the  New  York Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12,
2022; and be it further
