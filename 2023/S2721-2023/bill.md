 AN ACT to amend  the  executive  law,  the  real  property  actions  and
  proceedings law and the real property law, in relation to establishing
  the  New  York state office of civil representation to provide a right
  to counsel in eviction proceedings
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  Eviction  proceedings  have  a
 profoundly disparate impact on low-income  individuals  and  given  this
 disparate  impact,  it  is imperative that these individuals be provided
 legal representation in legal proceedings  that  put  their  housing  at
 risk.
  There is a fundamental human right to adequate housing accommodations.
 Safe,  secure,  and  accessible  housing is essential to achieving equal
 access to all other fundamental needs. Without housing, individuals  and
 families  too often cannot preserve family integrity, gain employment or
 other income, or enjoy  access  to  healthcare,  proper  nutrition,  and
 education.
  Eviction  proceedings and displacement as a result of evictions have a
 disparate impact on low-income individuals and particularly  on  low-in-
 come  people  of  color,  who  are disproportionately the respondents in
 eviction proceedings.
  Representation of people who are at risk  of  losing  their  homes  in
 legal  proceedings  preserves  access  to housing and ensures compliance
 with laws protecting people's rights in such proceedings. Abrupt, unwar-
 ranted, or unlawful  evictions  disrupt  lives  and  livelihoods,  force

 people  to find housing in a market with a severe shortage of affordable
 housing and often significantly increases the risk of homelessness.  The
 short- and long-term effects of housing instability are  devastating  to
 individuals  and  families  and  can  affect physical and mental health,
 employment and education. Providing a right to  counsel  to  individuals
 who  are  most at risk of housing instability not only protects individ-
 uals and families from these devastating effects, it saves public  funds
 that would otherwise be spent on shelters and services to people experi-
 encing  homelessness as well as the wide range of detrimental short- and
 long-term collateral consequences of housing instability.
