  § 8860. SHORT  TITLE.  THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS
 THE "INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT".
  § 8861. PURPOSE. IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, AND  IN
 RECOGNITION  OF  THE ADVANCES IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE, THE MEMBER
 STATES OF THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT HAVE ALLIED IN COMMON
 PURPOSE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS THAT COMPLEMENTS THE EXISTING
 LICENSING AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS,  PROVIDES  A
 STREAMLINED  PROCESS THAT ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO BECOME LICENSED IN MULTI-
 PLE STATES, THEREBY ENHANCING THE PORTABILITY OF A MEDICAL  LICENSE  AND
 ENSURING  THE  SAFETY OF PATIENTS.  THE COMPACT CREATES ANOTHER PATHWAY
 FOR LICENSURE AND DOES NOT OTHERWISE CHANGE A STATE'S  EXISTING  MEDICAL
 PRACTICE ACT. THE COMPACT ALSO ADOPTS THE PREVAILING STANDARD FOR LICEN-
 SURE  AND AFFIRMS THAT THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE OCCURS WHERE THE PATIENT
 IS LOCATED AT THE TIME OF THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT  ENCOUNTER,  AND  THERE-
 FORE,  REQUIRES  THE PHYSICIAN TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE
 MEDICAL BOARD WHERE THE PATIENT IS LOCATED. STATE  MEDICAL  BOARDS  THAT
 PARTICIPATE  IN THE COMPACT RETAIN THE JURISDICTION TO IMPOSE AN ADVERSE
 ACTION AGAINST A LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THAT STATE ISSUED TO  A
 PHYSICIAN THROUGH THE PROCEDURES IN THE COMPACT.
