  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 1, 2023, as Reef Awareness Day in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
environmental  issues  that  affect  the  lives  of citizens of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  June  1,  2023,  as  Reef
Awareness  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of World Reef Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established by  Raw  Elements,  World  Reef  Awareness  Day
serves  as  a call to action for consumers, businesses and organizations
to reflect on the delicate ecosystem of our ocean's coral reefs; the day
brings together the general public, influencers and opinion  leaders  to
create active change through education and engagement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Coral  reefs  are living communities of colonial organisms
made of individual polyps which excrete a bone-like skeleton that  forms
large  rock-like  structures which are homes for thousands of organisms;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The health of a reef tells us a lot about the health of  an
ocean;  many  fish  and  ocean  animals  rely  on  the protection of the
healthy, living reef for spawning  season;  it  also  supplies  a  rich,
thriving  food  chain,  from  plankton  and  algae  to  the  largest sea
creatures, the reef ecosystem is a significant life support system; and
 
  WHEREAS, The benefits of a healthy reef ecosystem go far beyond  the
ocean;  coral reefs are essential to the plant and fish life, contribute
to a lively  fishing  industry,  protect  beaches  and  coastlines  from
erosion,  act  as  the oceans filter, provide life-saving medicines, and
possibly the one animal on the planet capable of consuming plastic; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recent years, our most productive  reefs  have  been  in
decline  due to coral bleaching, for example, the Great Barrier Reef has
decreased by 40 percent; unfortunately,  it  is  even  worse  along  the
Florida  Keys and Caribbean, their decline is between 85 and 99 percent;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  Dr.  Craig  Downs,  Executive  Director  of
Haereticus  Environmental  Lab,  about  90  percent  of the reefs in the
Caribbean have disappeared since 1980; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coral reefs die off for many reasons, some of which include
rising sea temperatures;  unmanaged,  high-density  tourism;  industrial
pollution, plastic pollution, and sewage; and chemical sunscreens, which
should be replaced with non-nano zinc oxide sunscreen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious environmental issue, and more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity  at  the  local, state, national and international levels; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  June  1,  2023,  as  Reef
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and Raw Elements.
