 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the assessor of the town of Smithtown,
  county of Suffolk, to accept from Mother and Unborn Baby Care  of  LI,
  Inc., an application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Smithtown,  county  of  Suffolk,  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from Mother and Unborn Baby Care of Long Island,
 Inc., an application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to
 section  420-a  of  the  real property tax law, with respect to the 2021
 assessment roll, for the parcel owned by such  organization,  with  such
 parcel being located at 91 Maple Avenue, in the town of Smithtown, coun-
 ty  of  Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk county tax map district 0800
 section 104.00 block 02.00 lot 007.000.  If  accepted,  the  application
 shall  be  reviewed  as if it had been received on or before the taxable
 status date established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval by the Smithtown town board, may make appropriate correction to
 the  subject  rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organization,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,
 the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax  department  may,  in its sole
 discretion, provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel  those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
