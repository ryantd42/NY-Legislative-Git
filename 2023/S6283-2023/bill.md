 law,  as  amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (b) The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall review the

 ated  individual  is  so  debilitated  or  incapacitated as to [create a

 pable of presenting any danger to society] BE SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN HIS
 OR HER ABILITY TO SELF-AMBULATE OR TO PERFORM SIGNIFICANT NORMAL  ACTIV-
 ITIES  OF DAILY LIVING. If the commissioner does not so certify then the
 incarcerated individual shall not be referred to the board for consider-
 ation for release on medical parole. If the commissioner does so  certi-
 fy, then the commissioner shall, within seven working days of receipt of

  §  4.  Subdivision 4 of section 259-r of the executive law, as amended
 by section 38-l of subpart A of part C of chapter  62  of  the  laws  of
 2011,  paragraph  (b)  as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is
 amended to read as follows:
  4. (a) THE BOARD SHALL, UPON RECEIPT OF CERTIFICATION FROM THE COMMIS-
 SIONER, INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONDITIONS UNDER  WHICH  THE
 INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE RELEASED CREATES A REASONABLE PROBABIL-
 ITY  THAT HE OR SHE IS PHYSICALLY OR COGNITIVELY INCAPABLE OF PRESENTING
 A DANGER TO SOCIETY. THE BOARD SHALL PROVIDE A DETERMINATION OF  RELEASE
 WITHIN THIRTY DAYS UPON RECEIPT OF CERTIFICATION FROM THE COMMISSIONER.
  (B)  Medical  parole  granted  pursuant to this section shall be for a
 period of six months.
  [(b)] (C) The board shall require as a condition of release on medical
 parole that the releasee agree to remain under the care of  a  physician
 while  on medical parole and in a hospital established pursuant to arti-
 cle twenty-eight of the public health law, a hospice established  pursu-
 ant  to  article  forty  of the public health law or any other placement
 that can provide appropriate medical care as specified  in  the  medical
 discharge  plan required by subdivision two of this section. The medical
 discharge plan shall state that the availability of  the  placement  has
 been confirmed, and by whom. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
 when  an  incarcerated  individual  who qualifies for release under this
 section is cognitively incapable of signing the requisite  documentation
 to effectuate the medical discharge plan and, after a diligent search no
 person  has  been  identified  who  could  otherwise be appointed as the
 incarcerated individual's guardian by a court of competent jurisdiction,
 then, solely for the purpose of implementing the medical discharge plan,
 the facility health services director at the facility where  the  incar-
 cerated individual is currently incarcerated shall be lawfully empowered
 to  act  as  the  incarcerated  individual's guardian for the purpose of
 effectuating the medical discharge.
  [(c)] (D) Where appropriate, the board shall require as a condition of
 release that medical parolees be supervised on  intensive  caseloads  at
 reduced supervision ratios.
  [(d)] (E) The board shall require as a condition of release on medical
 parole  that  the  releasee  undergo periodic medical examinations and a
 medical examination at least one month prior to the  expiration  of  the
 period  of  medical  parole  and,  for the purposes of making a decision
 pursuant to paragraph [(e)] (F) of this subdivision, that  the  releasee
 provide  the board with a report, prepared by the treating physician, of
 the results of such examination. Such report  shall  specifically  state
 whether  or  not  the parolee continues to suffer from a terminal condi-
 tion, disease, or syndrome, and to be so debilitated or incapacitated as
 to be severely restricted in his or her ability to self-ambulate  or  to
 perform significant normal activities of daily living.
  [(e)]  (F) Prior to the expiration of the period of medical parole the
 board shall review the medical examination report required by  paragraph
 [(d)]  (E) of this subdivision and may again grant medical parole pursu-
 ant to this section; provided, however, that the provisions of paragraph
 (c) of subdivision one and subdivision two of  this  section  shall  not
 apply.
  [(f)]  (G) If the updated medical report presented to the board states
 that a parolee released pursuant to this section is no longer so debili-
 tated or incapacitated as to create a reasonable probability that he  or
 S. 6283  4
 
 she  is physically or cognitively incapable of presenting [any] A danger
 to society or if the releasee fails to submit the updated medical report
 then the board may not make a new grant of medical  parole  pursuant  to
 paragraph [(e)] (F) of this subdivision. Where the board has not granted
 medical  parole  pursuant  to  such  paragraph [(e)] (F) the board shall
 promptly conduct through one of its members, or cause to be conducted by
 a hearing officer designated by the board, a hearing to determine wheth-
 er the releasee is suffering  from  a  terminal  condition,  disease  or
 syndrome  and  is so debilitated or incapacitated as to create a reason-
 able probability that he or she is physically or  cognitively  incapable
 of  presenting  [any danger to society and does not present] a danger to
 society. If the board makes such a determination then it may make a  new
 grant  of  medical  parole pursuant to the standards of paragraph (b) of
 subdivision one of this section. At the hearing, the releasee shall have
 the right to representation by counsel,  including  the  right,  if  the
 releasee  is financially unable to retain counsel, to have the appropri-
 ate court assign counsel in accordance with the county or city plan  for
 representation placed in operation pursuant to article eighteen-B of the
 county law.
  [(g)]  (H)  The  hearing  and  determination provided for by paragraph
 [(f)] (G) of this subdivision shall be concluded within  the  six  month
 period  of  medical  parole.  If  the  board does not renew the grant of
 medical parole, it shall order that the releasee be returned immediately
 to the custody of the department.
  [(h)] (I) In addition to the procedures set forth in  paragraph  [(f)]
 (G)  of this subdivision, medical parole may be revoked at any time upon
 any of the grounds specified in paragraph (a) of  subdivision  three  of
 section two hundred fifty-nine-i of this article, and in accordance with
 the  procedures  specified  in  subdivision three of section two hundred
 fifty-nine-i of this article.
  [(i)] (J) A releasee who is on medical parole and who becomes eligible
 for parole pursuant to the provisions of subdivision two of section  two
 hundred  fifty-nine-i  of  this  article  shall  be  eligible for parole
 consideration pursuant to such subdivision.
  § 5. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 259-s of the  executive
 law,  as  amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (a) The board shall have the power to release on  medical  parole  any
 incarcerated individual serving an indeterminate or determinate sentence
 of  imprisonment  who,  pursuant to subdivision two of this section, has
 been certified to be suffering from a significant and permanent non-ter-
 minal condition, disease or syndrome that has rendered the  incarcerated
 individual  so physically or cognitively debilitated or incapacitated as
 to create a reasonable probability that he or she does not present [any]
 A danger to society, provided, however, that no incarcerated  individual
 serving  a  sentence  imposed  upon a conviction for murder in the first
 degree or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder in the first  degree
 shall  be eligible for such release, and provided further that no incar-
 cerated individual serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for  any
 of  the  following offenses shall be eligible for such release unless in
 the case of an indeterminate sentence he or  she  has  served  at  least
 one-half  of  the  minimum  period  of the sentence and in the case of a
 determinate sentence he or she has served at least one-half of the  term
 of  his  or  her  determinate  sentence:  murder  in  the second degree,
 manslaughter in the first degree, any offense  defined  in  article  one
 hundred  thirty  of  the  penal law or an attempt to commit any of these
 S. 6283  5
 
 offenses. Solely for the purpose of determining medical parole eligibil-
 ity pursuant to this section, such one-half of the minimum period of the
 indeterminate sentence and one-half  of  the  term  of  the  determinate
 sentence  shall not be credited with any time served under the jurisdic-
 tion of the department prior to the commencement of such sentence pursu-
 ant to the opening paragraph of subdivision one of section 70.30 of  the
 penal law or subdivision two-a of section 70.30 of the penal law, except
 to  the  extent  authorized by subdivision three of section 70.30 of the
 penal law.
  § 6. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 259-s of the  executive
 law,  as  amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (b) The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall review the
 diagnosis and may certify that the incarcerated individual is  suffering
 from such condition, disease or syndrome and that the incarcerated indi-
 vidual  is  so  debilitated  or incapacitated as to [create a reasonable
 probability that he or she is physically  or  cognitively  incapable  of
 presenting  any  danger to society] BE SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN HIS OR HER
 ABILITY TO SELF-AMBULATE OR TO PERFORM SIGNIFICANT NORMAL ACTIVITIES  OF
 DAILY LIVING. If the commissioner does not so certify then the incarcer-
 ated individual shall not be referred to the board for consideration for
 release on medical parole. If the commissioner does so certify, then the
 commissioner shall, within seven working days of receipt of such diagno-
 sis,  refer  the  incarcerated individual to the board for consideration
 for release on medical parole.  However, no such referral of  an  incar-
 cerated  individual  to  the  board  of  parole shall be made unless the
 incarcerated individual has been examined by a physician  and  diagnosed
 as having a condition, disease or syndrome as previously described here-
 in  at  some time subsequent to such incarcerated individual's admission
 to a facility operated by the department.
  § 7. Subdivision 4 of section 259-s of the executive law,  as  amended

 cle  twenty-eight of the public health law, a hospice established pursu-
 ant to article forty of the public health law or  any  other  placement,
 including  a residence with family or others, that can provide appropri-
 ate medical care as specified in the medical discharge plan required  by
 subdivision  two of this section. The medical discharge plan shall state
 that the availability of the placement has been confirmed, and by  whom.
 Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, when an incarcerated indi-
 vidual who qualifies for release under this section is cognitively inca-
 pable of signing the requisite documentation to effectuate  the  medical
 discharge  plan  and, after a diligent search no person has been identi-
 fied who could otherwise be appointed as the  incarcerated  individual's
 guardian  by  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction, then, solely for the
