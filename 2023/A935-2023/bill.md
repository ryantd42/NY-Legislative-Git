 read as follows:
  (a)  A  disposition  in  trust  for  the use of the creator is void as
 against the existing or subsequent creditors of the creator. NO INDIVID-
 UAL SHALL BE TREATED FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS  SECTION  AS  HAVING  MADE  A

 all property while held in trust for a judgment debtor, where the  trust

 person other than the judgment debtor, is exempt from application to the
 satisfaction of a money judgment. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A  JUDG-
 MENT  DEBTOR  SHALL  NOT  BE  TREATED  AS CREATING OR FUNDING A TRUST BY
 REASON OF THE LAPSE OF A POWER OF WITHDRAWAL OVER THE INCOME OR  PRINCI-
 PAL  OF A TRUST CREATED AND FUNDED BY A PERSON OR PERSONS OTHER THAN THE
 JUDGMENT DEBTOR.
