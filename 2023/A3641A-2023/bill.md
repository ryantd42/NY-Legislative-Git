 or incites any such conduct, shall be  liable,  in  a  civil  action  or
 proceeding  maintained  by  such individual or group of individuals, for
 injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate relief  in  law  or
 equity.  If  it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court or justice
 that the respondent has, in fact, violated this section,  an  injunction

 been injured or damaged thereby. For the purposes of this subdivision, a
 person lacks reason to suspect a violation of the penal law,  any  other
 criminal  conduct, or an imminent threat to a person or property where a
 reasonable person would not suspect such violation, conduct, or threat.
