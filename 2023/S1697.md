 Introduced  by  Sen. HELMING -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the social services law, in relation to  aligning  Medi-
  caid optional services with private sector health benefits
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "Medicaid taxpayer equity act".
  §  2.  The legislature hereby finds that it is fundamentally unfair to
 the taxpayers of the state for Medicaid optional services to exceed  the
 minimum  health  insurance benefits levels that are required for private
 sector health  insurance  plans.  Higher  benefit  levels  for  Medicaid
 compared  to private insurance create a disincentive for people to leave
 public assistance and  accept  private  employment  and  private  health
 coverage.  Higher Medicaid benefit levels are also a contributing factor
 causing the state to have the highest Medicaid costs in the  nation  and
 some  of  the  highest property taxes in the nation. The purpose of this
 act is to ensure that Medicaid  optional  services  for  adults  do  not
 exceed the minimum health insurance benefit levels that apply to private
 insurance plans, other than long-term care services.
  §  3.  Title  11 of article 5 of the social services law is amended by
 adding a new section 362 to read as follows:
  § 362. BENEFITS  PROVIDED  UNDER  THIS  TITLE  FOR  MEDICAID  OPTIONAL
 SERVICES. THE STATE SHALL NOT OFFER TO INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF TWEN-
 TY-ONE YEARS MEDICAID OPTIONAL SERVICES THAT EXCEED THE MINIMUM BENEFITS
 REQUIRED  FOR  HEALTH CARE PLANS UNDER ARTICLE FORTY-THREE OF THE INSUR-
 ANCE LAW. THIS SECTION  SHALL  NOT  APPLY  TO  MEDICAID  LONG-TERM  CARE
 SERVICES.
  §  4. The commissioner of the department of health shall submit to the
 federal department of health and human services for approval any  amend-
 ments  to  the state plan required by this act. Furthermore, the commis-

 sioner of the department of health shall have the authority  to  promul-
 gate  or  amend any regulations necessary for the implementation of this
 act.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
