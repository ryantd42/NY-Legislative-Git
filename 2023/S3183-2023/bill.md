  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 2857  of  the  education  law,  as
 amended  by  section 7 of part D-2 of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007, is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. The board of regents shall distribute  information  announcing  the
 availability  of the charter school process described in this article to
 each local school district and public postsecondary educational institu-
 tion. At each significant stage of the chartering process,  the  charter
 entity  and  the board of regents shall provide appropriate notification
 to the school district in which the charter school  is  located  and  to
 public and nonpublic schools in the same geographic area as the proposed
 charter  school.  Such  notification  shall  be provided by each charter
 entity within thirty days of its receipt of an application for formation
 of a new charter school or for renewal of an  existing  charter  school,
 and  at  least  forty-five days prior to initial approval of the charter
 application by the charter entity. Prior to the issuance,  revision,  or
 renewal of a charter, the school district in which the charter school is
 located  shall hold a public hearing to solicit comments from the commu-
 nity in connection with the foregoing. Such hearing shall be held within
 the community potentially impacted by the proposed charter school.  When
 a  revision  involves  the relocation of a charter school to a different
 school district, OR, IN A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE,
 TO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY EDUCATION COUNCIL DISTRICT,  the  proposed  new
 school  district OR COMMUNITY EDUCATION COUNCIL DISTRICT shall also hold
 such hearing.  In addition, such school districts  shall  be  given  an
 opportunity to comment on the proposed charter to the charter entity and

 such  charter  entity  shall consider any comments raised and submit any

  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
