 Hudson river park act, chapter 592 of the laws of 1998 as  amended,  the
 creation,  development,  operation  and  maintenance of the Hudson river
 park will enhance and protect the natural, cultural and historic aspects
 of the Hudson river, enhance and afford quality  public  access  to  the
 river,  allow  for  an  array  of cultural and recreational programs and
 provide a host of other public benefits.  The changes to the 1998 law by
 this act are intended to further  enhance  and  protect  the  river  and
 increase public access and enjoyment of the Hudson river park.
  §  2.  Paragraph  (g) of section 3 of chapter 592 of the laws of 1998,
 constituting the Hudson river park act, as amended by chapter 517 of the

  (g) "Park/commercial use" means a use that is not a prohibited use and

  (iii) limited parking spaces incidental to permitted uses;
  (iv)  solely at piers 59, 60, and 61 and the headhouse (commonly known
