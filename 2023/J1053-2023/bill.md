the programs her children were involved in; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  elected  to  the Port Chester Board of Education in
1993, Anne Capeci has continuously served through nine elections, during
which time she was instrumental in bringing the Open Door program to the
school district; this  vital  program  helps  children  without  private
medical or dental insurance get the care they need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  throughout  her  tenure,  Anne  Capeci
collaborated with her fellow board members to support the administration
in the efforts to raise standardized test scores and develop new  sports
programs  such  as  ice  hockey,  swimming,  lacrosse, cheerleading, and

  WHEREAS,  In  her  more than five decades of community service, Anne

  WHEREAS, For more than 30 years, Anne Capeci has also been a  member
of  the  Port  Chester-Rye Brook Rotary Club, where she was been named a

three-year-old Gift of Life child from the Philippines in her home after
a life-changing operation; and

benefit the Salvation Army; and
 
  WHEREAS, After losing her son to melanoma, Anne established the Amid
Roland Capeci, Jr. Scholarship at Port Chester High School for  students
studying  art and design, a fitting tribute as Amid got his start within

career  as  Design  Director at Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and
Newsweek, to name a few; and
 
  WHEREAS, A longtime resident of Port Chester, New York, Anne  Capeci
is  now  the  proud  grandmother  to  five  grandchildren,  and  in  her
retirement will continue to give back to the community that has given so
much to her and her family; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed is  the  occurrence  of  such  a  compassionate
blending  of  strength,  leadership,  intellect,  and commitment as that
demonstrated by Anne Capeci over a lifetime of sacrifice and  dedication
to others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Anne Capeci upon the occasion of  her  retirement,  and  to
wish  her  continued  success  in  all  her  future endeavors; and be it
further
