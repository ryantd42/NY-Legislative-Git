 AN ACT in relation to establishing the Beacon School  Pilot  Program  in
  New York city schools
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York City Beacon School Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. Gun violence and gang activity has become a
 severe  issue in the United States as a whole, specifically in New York,
 Los Angeles, Detroit, and Chicago.  In  most  cases,  youth  join  gangs
 because  they  feel  they  need  protection,  they  want to be accepted,
 respected or all of the above. Through various youth development  initi-
 atives  and  programs  we can create an environment that will meet these
 needs for young people in urban communities and thus reduce gang and gun
 violence. Beacon offers New York city youth with a place to grow through
 challenging activities, caring relationships, and  opportunities.  The
 youth  development  quality  of the Beacon environment results in higher
 self-esteem among youth, increased leadership skills, and higher  expec-
 tations  by staff and youth for behavior and performance. Beacon reduces
 the likelihood of students to cut classes, bullying,  and  other  crimes
 against persons or property. Beacon also provides important services and
 activities  for  neighborhood adults including sports, physical fitness,
 basic  education,  English-language  instruction,  GED  preparation  and
 computer  instruction.  Beacon creates cohesion between youths, parents,
 community organizations and businesses, engaging  the  community  in  an
 effort to reduce gang and gun violence.
  § 3. Purpose. The purpose of this act is to provide all public elemen-
 tary and secondary schools located in New York city the structure, flex-
 ibility  and  support necessary to operate under the Beacon school model
 to:

  1. enable public schools and community partners, including public  and
 private  agencies,  community  based  organizations,  local  government,
 institutions of higher education, families, after school program provid-
 ers, summer program providers, museums, libraries,  and  other  cultural
 institutions  and  civic  organizations, to leverage their resources and
 prepare the community they serve to compete in today's global economy;
  2. reduce the incidents of gun and gang violence in the New York  city
 community  by providing the activities and education necessary to engage
 the community; and
  3.  provide  funding  for  the  expansion,  and  the  continuation  of
 results-driven partnerships that align numerous funding streams, includ-
 ing  public  and  private funding, and leverage existing funding to make
 every New York city public school into a Beacon school.
  § 4. Definitions. As used in this act the following terms  shall  have
 the following meanings:
  1. "Beacon" shall mean a community center located in public elementary
 and  secondary  school  buildings,  offering  a  range of activities and
 services to participants of all ages, before and after  school,  in  the

  § 5. The Beacon school model. 1. Every public elementary and secondary
 school shall be empowered to  use  funds  whether  public,  private,  or
 otherwise,  to  transform the host school into a Beacon school, in order
 to: (i) improve student achievement in the school;  (ii)  create  incen-

 programming and activities of the Beacon center.
