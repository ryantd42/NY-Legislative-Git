  COMMENDING  outgoing  Chief  Robert Gallagher upon
  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  more  than 15 years of dedicated
  service to the New Hyde Park  Fire  Department  on
  February 25, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is justly proud to commend outgoing
Chief Robert Gallagher upon the occasion of his designation for  special
recognition  after  more  than  15 years of dedicated service to the New
Hyde Park Fire Department, to be celebrated  at  its  Annual  Inspection
Dinner  on  Saturday,  February  25, 2023, at Russo's On The Bay, Howard
Beach, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Gallagher joined the New Hyde Park  Fire  Department
on  August  21,  2007;  throughout his more than 15 years of service, he
held several positions within the Department including: Deputy Chief and
Chief from 2018-2022; he is also an active member of the Estates  Engine
Company  No.  3  where  he has served as Captain, 1st Lieutenant and 2nd
Lieutenant; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity;  they  are  often  the  first  to  respond  to  an
emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is a fire, transportation accident,
natural  disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical  crisis,  or  spill  of
hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
outgoing Chief Robert Gallagher is such a firefighter;  throughout  more
than  15  years  of  devoted service, he heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  outgoing  Chief  Robert  Gallagher  upon  the  occasion  of his
designation  for  special  recognition  after  more  than  15  years  of
dedicated  service  to the New Hyde Park Fire Department on February 25,
2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to outgoing Chief Robert Gallagher.
