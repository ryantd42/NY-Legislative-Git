 REASONABLE  INQUIRY,  SHALL  DISCLOSE TO ALL PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT TO
 ARBITRATE AND THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND TO  ANY  OTHER  ARBITRATORS
 ANY KNOWN FACTS THAT A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD CONSIDER LIKELY TO AFFECT

 AFFECT THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE ARBITRATOR.
  (C) IF AN ARBITRATOR DISCLOSES A FACT REQUIRED BY SUBDIVISION  (A)  OR
 (B)  OF  THIS  SECTION TO BE DISCLOSED AND A PARTY TIMELY OBJECTS TO THE
 APPOINTMENT OR CONTINUED SERVICE OF THE ARBITRATOR BASED UPON  THE  FACT
 DISCLOSED,  THE  OBJECTION MAY BE A GROUND FOR VACATING AN AWARD MADE BY
 THE ARBITRATOR.

 SION  (A)  OR (B) OF THIS SECTION, UPON TIMELY OBJECTION BY A PARTY, THE

 SHIP WITH A PARTY IS PRESUMED TO ACT WITH EVIDENT PARTIALITY.
