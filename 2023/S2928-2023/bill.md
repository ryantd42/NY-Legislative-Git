  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  public health law is amended by adding a new section

 COMMUNITY BASED LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS SUBMITTED
 UNDER CONTRACTS OR AGREEMENTS WITH INSURERS UNDER THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE

 SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED  SIXTY-FIVE-F  OF  THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW SHALL
 INCLUDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF  PERSONAL
 PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT (PPE) FOR DIRECT CARE WORKERS, CARE RECIPIENTS AND

 THE EVENT OF A DECLARATION OF A STATE  OF  EMERGENCY,  RATE  ADJUSTMENTS
 SHALL  BE  REVIEWED AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS TO ACCOMMODATE AN
 IMMEDIATE NEED FOR INCREASED SUPPLIES OF PPE. PROVIDED THAT  NO  PORTION
 OF  THE  DOLLARS  SPENT  OR  TO BE SPENT TO SATISFY THE NEED FOR PPE FOR
 WORKERS UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE RETAINED OR USED FOR ANOTHER  MANNER
 BY THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED LONG TERM CARE PROVIDER OR FISCAL INTER-
