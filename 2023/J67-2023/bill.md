  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Preservation Month in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness of the need  to
protect  the  unique  historical  treasures  which exist across New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as  Preservation
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Preservation Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, On October 15, 1966, the United States Congress passed  the
National  Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) making the Federal Government
a full partner and source of  leadership  for  preservation  to  "foster
conditions  under  which  our  modern  society  and  our prehistoric and
historic resources can exist in productive harmony"; and
 
  WHEREAS, The passage of the NHPA more than 50  years  ago  marked  a
fundamental  shift  in how Americans and the Federal Government regarded
the role of historic preservation in modern life, and led to the  vastly
more complex historic preservation mosaic we know today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1971,  the  National  Trust  for Historic Preservation
created Preservation Week to spotlight  local  preservation  efforts  in
America,  which  has  since  grown  into  National Historic Preservation
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Preservation Month in  the  State  of  New  York  is
observed by small towns and big cities across the state during the month
of  May,  with  events ranging from architectural and historic tours, to
fundraising events, and educational programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  preservation  of  New  York's  many  diverse  historic
properties  is both a public activity and a private passion supported by
individual citizens,  organizations,  businesses,  communities,  elected
officials,  and public institutions working together to protect our rich
cultural legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within  the  past  generation,  historic  preservation  has
evolved  from  a  cause  with limited support into a broad based popular
movement for those  who  wish  to  learn  about  and  embrace  America's
heritage in a direct and meaningful way; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Greater  recognition  that  historic preservation is often
associated  with  economic  success,  as  well  as  the  belief  that
preservation  of  historic  districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects enhances the quality of  life  of  our  communities  has  caused
public  support  for  historic  preservation to flow from the bottom up,
making it in the truest sense a grassroots movement; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the sense of this Legislative Body that New York's
invaluable cultural, educational, and historic  institutions  should  be
celebrated  and recognized by all the citizens of this great State; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Preservation
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Preservation Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
