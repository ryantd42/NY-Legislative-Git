 abandonment of one or more plants or facilities of the project  occupant

 PERSONNEL WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY THE PROJECT OCCUPANT,  provided,  however,
 that  neither  restriction  shall apply if the agency shall determine on
 the basis of the application before it that the  project  is  reasonably
 necessary  to  discourage  the project occupant from removing such other
 plant or facility to a location  outside  the  state  or  is  reasonably
 necessary  to  preserve the competitive position of the project occupant
