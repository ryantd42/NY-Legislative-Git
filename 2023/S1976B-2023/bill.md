 subdivisions five and six of this section.  THE COURT MAY  TRANSFER  THE

 court OR REMOTELY at any  time  to  enable  the  court  to  monitor  the
 [defendant's]  progress  in  [alcohol  or  substance use] treatment. The
 court shall provide notice, reasonable under the circumstances,  to  the
 people,  the  treatment  provider,  the  [defendant] PARTICIPANT and the
 [defendant's] PARTICIPANT'S counsel  whenever  it  orders  or  otherwise
 requires the appearance of the [defendant] PARTICIPANT in court. Failure
 to appear as required without reasonable cause therefor shall constitute
 a violation of the conditions of the court's agreement with the [defend-
 ant] PARTICIPANT.
  9.  (a)  If at any time during the [defendant's participation] PARTIC-
 IPANT'S ENGAGEMENT in the judicial  diversion  program,  the  court  has
 reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the  [defendant] PARTICIPANT has
 violated a [release] PROGRAM condition in an important  respect  or  has
 willfully  failed  to  appear  before  the court as requested, the court
 except as provided in subdivision two of section 510.50 of this  chapter
 regarding  a failure to appear, shall direct the [defendant] PARTICIPANT
 to appear [or issue a bench warrant to a police officer or an  appropri-
 ate peace officer directing him or her to take the defendant into custo-
 dy  and  bring the defendant before the court without unnecessary delay;
 provided, however, that under no circumstances  shall  a  defendant  who
 requires  treatment  for opioid use be deemed to have violated a release
 condition on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  participation  in  medically
 prescribed  drug treatments under the care of a health care professional
 licensed or certified under title eight of  the  education  law,  acting
 within  his  or  her  lawful  scope  of  practice]  FOR A HEARING ON THE
 VIOLATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION  WITH  AT  LEAST
 FORTY-EIGHT  HOURS  NOTICE TO THE PARTICIPANT OR THE PARTICIPANT'S COUN-
 SEL, UNLESS NOTICE IS WAIVED BY THE PARTICIPANT.  THE  COURT  MAY  NOT
 MODIFY THE PARTICIPANT'S SECURING ORDER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE HEARING'S
 CONCLUSION.  The  relevant  provisions of section 530.60 of this chapter
 relating to issuance of securing orders shall apply to such  proceedings
 under  this  subdivision.  THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT A BENCH WARRANT
 SHALL NOT BE ISSUED FOR PARTICIPANTS IN JUDICIAL DIVERSION.
  (b) In determining whether a [defendant] PARTICIPANT violated a condi-
 tion of [his or her release under] the  judicial  diversion  program  OR
 WILLFULLY  FAILED  TO  APPEAR  IN COURT, the court [may] SHALL conduct a
 [summary] hearing consistent with due process [and sufficient] to satis-
 S. 1976  8
 
 fy the court that the [defendant] PARTICIPANT has, in fact, violated the
 condition OR WILLFULLY FAILED TO APPEAR.

 THE PARTICIPANT'S COUNSEL, BUT IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE LESS THAN  FORTY-EIGHT
 HOURS NOTICE, UNLESS NOTICE IS WAIVED BY THE PARTICIPANT.
  (II) THE PEOPLE SHALL BEAR THE BURDEN OF PROVING BY CLEAR AND CONVINC-
 ING  EVIDENCE THAT THE PARTICIPANT HAS VIOLATED A CONDITION OF THE JUDI-
 CIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM IN AN  IMPORTANT  RESPECT.  THE  PARTICIPANT  MAY
 CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES AND MAY PRESENT RELEVANT, ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE ON
 THEIR  OWN  BEHALF. THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER ALL FACTORS RELATING TO THE
 PARTICIPANT'S CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH OR COGNITIVE STATUS,  THEIR  ENGAGE-
 MENT  WITH  JUDICIAL  DIVERSION PRIOR TO THIS TIME, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
 FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED THEIR PARTICIPATION OR ALLEGED VIOLATION.
  (III) A BENCH WARRANT SHALL NOT BE ISSUED  ABSENT  A  FINDING  BY  THE
 COURT  THAT  THE  ALLEGED VIOLATION OR FAILURE TO APPEAR WAS WILLFUL. IN
 DETERMINING WILLFULNESS, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER: THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE
 PARTICIPANT'S VIOLATION  OR  FAILURE  TO  APPEAR  AND  THEIR  FUNCTIONAL
 IMPAIRMENT; WHETHER AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PLAN IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE;
 THE  PARTICIPANT'S  HISTORY  OF  MAKING COURT APPEARANCES IN THE INSTANT
 MATTER; AND A HISTORY OF POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH TREATMENT STAFF OR THE
 COURT.
  (IV) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL A PARTICIPANT WHO REQUIRES TREATMENT
 FOR A FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT BE DEEMED TO HAVE VIOLATED A PROGRAM  CONDI-
 TION  ON THE PARTICIPATION IN MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED DRUG TREATMENTS UNDER
 THE CARE OF A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL LICENSED OR CERTIFIED UNDER TITLE
 EIGHT OF THE EDUCATION LAW, ACTING WITHIN HIS OR  HER  LAWFUL  SCOPE  OF
 PRACTICE.
  (V)  IF THE COURT FINDS A REASONABLE EXPLANATION OR MITIGATION FOR ANY
 ALLEGED VIOLATION OR ALLEGED WILLFUL FAILURE  TO  APPEAR,  THE  SECURING
 ORDER SHALL NOT BE MODIFIED.
  (VI)  THE COURT MAY SEAL PORTIONS OF THE PROCEEDING RELATED TO COLLAT-
 ERAL CONSEQUENCES AT THE REQUEST OF THE  PARTICIPANT  AND  PARTICIPANT'S
 COUNSEL.
  (c)  If the court determines BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE that the
 [defendant] PARTICIPANT has violated a condition of his or  her  release
 under  the  judicial diversion program, the court may PERMIT THE PARTIC-
 IPANT TO CONTINUE THEIR TREATMENT MANDATE AS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED;  modify
 the  [conditions  thereof,  reconsider the order of recognizance or bail
 pursuant to subdivision two of section 510.30 of this  chapter,]  TREAT-
 MENT  PLAN PER THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TREATMENT PROVIDER; HOLD TREAT-
 MENT IN ABEYANCE UNTIL THE UNDERLYING MATTER THAT CAUSED  THE  VIOLATION
 IS  RESOLVED; or terminate the [defendant's] PARTICIPANT'S participation
 in the judicial diversion program[; and when applicable proceed with the
 defendant's sentencing in accordance with the agreement. Notwithstanding
 any provision of law to the contrary, the court may impose any  sentence
 authorized  for  the  crime  of  conviction  in accordance with the plea
 agreement, or any lesser sentence authorized to be imposed on  a  felony
 drug  offender  pursuant  to  paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision two of
 section 70.70 of the penal law taking into account] IF NO  OTHER  TREAT-
 MENT OPTION IS AVAILABLE.  THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER:
  (I)  the  length of time the [defendant] PARTICIPANT spent in residen-
 tial treatment and how best to continue treatment [while  the  defendant
 is  serving  that  sentence.  In  determining  what action to take for a
 violation of a release condition, the court shall consider];
  (II) all relevant circumstances, including the views of  the  prosecu-
 tor, the defense and the [alcohol or substance use] PARTICIPANT'S INTER-
