 impacted population is summarized below.

  POLICE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  11,723
  - Average Age:  43.4
  - Average Service:  17.6
  - Average Salary:  156,600
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Pension benefits are primarily derived as a
 percentage of salary base. For Tier 2 POLICE members hired prior to July
 1, 2000, the salary base is equal to the greater of
  (1) the pensionable earnings in the final 12 months of service, or
  (2)  the  average pensionable earnings earned in any consecutive three
 years of service.
  For Tier 2 POLICE members hired on or after July 1, 2000,  the  salary
 base  is equal to the pensionable earnings earned in the final 12 months
 of service only.
  Under the proposed legislation, the salary base  shall  be  determined
 the  same for Tier 2 POLICE members hired on or after July 1, 2000 as it
 is for Tier 2 members hired prior to July 1, 2000.
  Note, pensionable earnings in the final 12 months or the highest three
 consecutive years, are subject to certain limits.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
