  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Section 443  of
 the  Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to change the salary base
 for Tier 2 members of the New York City Police Pension Fund (POLICE) who
 are hired on or after July 1, 2000.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.

 1,  2000  (original  Tier  2  members),  the salary base is equal to the
 greater of
  (1) the pensionable earnings in the final 12 months of service, or
  (2)  the  average pensionable earnings earned in any consecutive three
 years of service.
  For Tier 2 POLICE members hired on or after July 1, 2000,  the  salary
 base  is equal to the pensionable earnings earned in the final 12 months
 of service only.
  Under the proposed legislation, the salary base  shall  be  determined
 the  same for Tier 2 POLICE members hired on or after July 1, 2000 as it
 is for Tier 2 members hired prior to July 1, 2000.
  Note, pensionable earnings in the final 12 months or the highest three
 consecutive years, are subject to certain limits.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census  data  and  the
 actuarial  assumptions  and  methods  described herein, the enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an  increase  in  the  Present
 Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) and the present value of future employer
 contributions of approximately $5.6 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to POLICE, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $3.6 million and an increase in
 the  present  value of future employer Normal Cost of approximately $2.0
 million.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of
 this  proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in annual
 employer contributions of approximately $1.2 million which is the result
 of an increase in the Normal Cost in addition to the UAL payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining  working  lifetime  for this group is approximately seven
 years and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over a  seven-year
 period  (six  payments  under  the One-Year Lag Methodology) using level
 dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of POLICE to deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There are 12,849 active Tier 2 Police members hired on or  after  July
 1, 2000 as of June 30, 2022 and they have an average age of approximate-
 ly 42.6 years, average service of approximately 16.8 years, and an aver-
 age salary of approximately $150,500.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of POLICE.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of POLICE used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.

 proposed legislation.
