 in whole or in part, for the aforesaid purposes on the date such  agree-
 ment  is  executed and shall apply to taxes which become due and payable
 after the aforestated agreement is  executed  and  shall  continue  with
 respect  to  such property as long as both of said teams play their home
 games therein and no longer. Such exemption shall not apply with respect
 to any improvement to such property made after the date  such  agreement
 is  executed  which improvement is not used for the provision of facili-
 ties  or  services  related  to  sports,  entertainment,  expositions,
 conventions  or trade shows. If one or both of said teams shall cease to
 play their home games in said property at any time,  the  tax  exemption
 provided  herein  shall  cease immediately and such property shall imme-
