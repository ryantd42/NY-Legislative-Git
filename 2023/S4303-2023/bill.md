 provide both electric and gas  supply  service,  provided  further  that
 community  choice  aggregators  may  not  select  any ESCO that has been
 deemed ineligible to provide energy services by the department.
  (c)  in  making a selection, community choice aggregators may contract
 with any number of contractors to design, build, operate,  and/or  main-
