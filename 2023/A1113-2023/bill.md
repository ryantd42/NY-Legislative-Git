 HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS DEFINED IN SECTION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE-A OF
 THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW.
  3. FOR APPLICANTS ON THE WAITING LIST WITH THE SAME PREFERENCE STATUS,
 LOCAL  PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES SHALL SELECT APPLICANTS USING THE DATE
 AND TIME OF APPLICATION, GIVING PRIORITY TO APPLICATIONS IN THE ORDER OF
 WHICH THEY ARE RECEIVED.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply  to  local
 housing  authorities  upon  the  addition  of  any  person to any of the
 authority's waiting lists.
