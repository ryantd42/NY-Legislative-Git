  7. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES AND PERFORM-
 ANCE  STANDARDS  TO FACILITATE INSPECTIONS OF DWELLING UNITS AND CONFORM
 SUCH INSPECTIONS WITH PRACTICES UTILIZED IN THE PRIVATE HOUSING  MARKET.
 SUCH  GUIDELINES  AND STANDARDS SHALL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARIATIONS
 IN LOCAL LAWS AND PRACTICES AND SHALL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO THE HOUSING
 ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR APPROPRIATE TO  FACILITATE  EFFICIENT
 PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS SECTION.
  § 615. RENT.  1.  THE  RENT  FOR  DWELLING  UNITS  FOR WHICH A HOUSING

 PROVIDED IN SECTION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE) SHALL, AT THE
 REQUEST  OF  AN  INDIVIDUAL  OR FAMILY RECEIVING TENANT-BASED ASSISTANCE
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE, ASSIST THAT INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY  IN  NEGOTIATING  A

 LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR (OR OTHER SUCH ENTITY) SHALL REVIEW THE RENT  FOR  A
 UNIT  UNDER  CONSIDERATION  BY  THE  INDIVIDUAL  OR FAMILY (AND ALL RENT
 INCREASES FOR UNITS UNDER LEASE BY THE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY)  TO  DETER-
 MINE  WHETHER  THE  RENT  (OR  RENT  INCREASE) REQUESTED BY THE OWNER IS
 REASONABLE. IF A HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL  ADMINISTRATOR  (OR  OTHER
 SUCH  ENTITY) DETERMINES THAT THE RENT (OR RENT INCREASE) FOR A DWELLING
 UNIT IS NOT REASONABLE, THE HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER  LOCAL  ADMINISTRATOR
 (OR OTHER SUCH ENTITY) SHALL NOT MAKE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS TO THE
 OWNER UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION WITH RESPECT TO THAT UNIT.
  3.  IF A DWELLING UNIT FOR WHICH A HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENT CONTRACT
 IS ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS ARTICLE IS  EXEMPT  FROM  LOCAL  RENT  CONTROL
 PROVISIONS  DURING  THE  TERM  OF  THAT CONTRACT, THE RENT FOR THAT UNIT
 SHALL BE REASONABLE IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER UNITS IN  THE  RENTAL  AREA
 THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM LOCAL RENT CONTROL PROVISIONS.

 PAYMENT OF ANY AMOUNTS DUE TO A DWELLING UNIT OWNER UNDER THIS  SECTION,
 SUBJECT  TO APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE HOUSING ASSIST-
 ANCE PAYMENT CONTRACT BETWEEN THE OWNER AND THE HOUSING  ACCESS  VOUCHER
 LOCAL  ADMINISTRATOR  MAY  PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES FOR THE LATE PAYMENT OF
 AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CONTRACT, WHICH SHALL BE IMPOSED  ON  THE  HOUSING
 ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED
 PRACTICES IN THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET.
  5.  UNLESS  OTHERWISE  AUTHORIZED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER, EACH HOUSING
 ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR SHALL PAY ANY PENALTIES FROM ADMINIS-
 TRATIVE FEES COLLECTED BY THE HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER  LOCAL  ADMINISTRA-
 TOR,  EXCEPT THAT NO PENALTY SHALL BE IMPOSED IF THE LATE PAYMENT IS DUE
 TO FACTORS THAT THE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES ARE BEYOND  THE  CONTROL  OF
 THE HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
  § 616. VACATED  UNITS.  IF  AN ASSISTED FAMILY VACATES A DWELLING UNIT
 FOR WHICH RENTAL ASSISTANCE  IS  PROVIDED  UNDER  A  HOUSING  ASSISTANCE
 PAYMENT  CONTRACT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF THE LEASE FOR THE
 UNIT, RENTAL ASSISTANCE PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACT MAY  NOT  BE  PROVIDED
 FOR THE UNIT AFTER THE MONTH DURING WHICH THE UNIT WAS VACATED.
  § 617. LEASING OF UNITS OWNED BY A HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMIN-
 ISTRATOR.  1.  IF  AN  ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY ASSISTED UNDER THIS
 S. 568  11
 
 ARTICLE LEASES A DWELLING UNIT (OTHER THAN  A  PUBLIC  HOUSING  DWELLING
 UNIT)  THAT  IS  OWNED  BY  A HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR
 ADMINISTERING  ASSISTANCE  TO  THAT  INDIVIDUAL  OR  FAMILY  UNDER  THIS
 SECTION,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  REQUIRE  THE  UNIT  OF GENERAL LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT OR ANOTHER ENTITY  APPROVED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER,  TO  MAKE
 INSPECTIONS  REQUIRED UNDER SECTION SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE
 AND RENT DETERMINATIONS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION SIX  HUNDRED  FIFTEEN  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE.  THE  HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR SHALL BE
 RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EXPENSES OF  SUCH  INSPECTIONS  AND  DETERMINATIONS,
 SUBJECT TO THE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
  2.  FOR  PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "OWNED BY A HOUSING ACCESS
 VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR" MEANS, WITH RESPECT  TO  A  DWELLING  UNIT,
 THAT THE DWELLING UNIT IS IN A PROJECT THAT IS OWNED BY SUCH ADMINISTRA-
 TOR,  BY  AN  ENTITY  WHOLLY  CONTROLLED  BY SUCH ADMINISTRATOR, OR BY A
 LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH SUCH  ADMINIS-
 TRATOR  (OR  AN  ENTITY WHOLLY CONTROLLED BY SUCH ADMINISTRATOR) HOLDS A
 CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE MANAGING MEMBER OR GENERAL PARTNER. A DWELL-
 ING UNIT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE OWNED BY  A  HOUSING  ACCESS  VOUCHER
 LOCAL  ADMINISTRATOR  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION BECAUSE SUCH ADMINIS-
 TRATOR HOLDS A FEE INTEREST AS GROUND LESSOR IN THE  PROPERTY  ON  WHICH
 THE UNIT IS SITUATED, HOLDS A SECURITY INTEREST UNDER A MORTGAGE OR DEED
 OF  TRUST  ON THE UNIT, OR HOLDS A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN AN ENTITY
 WHICH OWNS THE UNIT OR IN THE MANAGING MEMBER OR GENERAL PARTNER  OF  AN
 ENTITY WHICH OWNS THE UNIT.
  § 618. VERIFICATION OF INCOME. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH PROCE-
 DURES  WHICH  ARE  APPROPRIATE  AND NECESSARY TO ASSURE THAT INCOME DATA
 PROVIDED TO THE HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR AND OWNERS BY
 INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES APPLYING FOR OR RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE IS COMPLETE AND ACCURATE. IN ESTABLISHING SUCH  PROCEDURES,  THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL RANDOMLY, REGULARLY, AND PERIODICALLY SELECT A SAMPLE
 OF FAMILIES TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSIONER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THESE
 FAMILIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCOME VERIFICATION, OR TO ALLOW THOSE FAMI-
 LIES  TO  PROVIDE  SUCH  INFORMATION  THEMSELVES.  SUCH  INFORMATION MAY
 INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO,  DATA  CONCERNING  UNEMPLOYMENT  COMPEN-
 SATION  AND  FEDERAL  INCOME TAXATION AND DATA RELATING TO BENEFITS MADE
 AVAILABLE UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, 42 U.S.C. 301 ET SEQ., THE FOOD
 AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 ET SEQ., OR  TITLE  38  OF  THE
 UNITED  STATE  CODE.  ANY  SUCH  INFORMATION  RECEIVED  PURSUANT TO THIS
 SECTION SHALL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL BE USED ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE
 OF VERIFYING INCOMES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE  ELIGIBILITY  OF  INDIVIDUALS
 AND  FAMILIES  FOR  BENEFITS  (AND  THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, IF ANY)
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  § 619. DIVISION OF AN ASSISTED FAMILY. 1. IN THOSE INSTANCES  WHERE  A
 FAMILY  ASSISTED  UNDER  THIS ARTICLE BECOMES DIVIDED INTO TWO OTHERWISE
 ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES DUE TO DIVORCE, LEGAL SEPARATION OR THE
 DIVISION OF THE FAMILY, WHERE THE NEW UNITS CANNOT AGREE AS TO WHICH NEW
 UNIT SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE, AND WHERE  THERE  IS  NO
 DETERMINATION  BY  A  COURT, THE PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY SHALL CONSIDER
 THE FOLLOWING FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR  FAMILIES
 WILL CONTINUE TO BE ASSISTED:
  (A) WHICH OF THE NEW UNITS HAS CUSTODY OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN;
  (B) WHICH FAMILY MEMBER WAS THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WHEN THE VOUCHER WAS
 INITIALLY ISSUED AS LISTED ON THE INITIAL APPLICATION;
  (C)  THE  COMPOSITION OF THE NEW UNITS AND WHICH UNIT INCLUDES ELDERLY
 OR DISABLED MEMBERS;
 S. 568  12
 
  (D) WHETHER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS INVOLVED IN THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMI-
 LY UNIT;
  (E) WHICH FAMILY MEMBERS REMAIN IN THE UNIT; AND
  (F) RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOCIAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS.
  2.  DOCUMENTATION  OF  THESE FACTORS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
 REQUESTING PARTIES. IF DOCUMENTATION IS NOT PROVIDED, THE HOUSING ACCESS
 VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR WILL TERMINATE ASSISTANCE ON  THE  BASIS  OF
 FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR A RECERTIFICATION.
  § 620. MAINTENANCE  OF  EFFORT.  ANY  FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO
 THIS ARTICLE SHALL NOT BE USED TO OFFSET OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT  OF  FUNDS
 PREVIOUSLY  EXPENDED FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN A PRIOR YEAR IN
 ANY COUNTY OR IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, BUT SHALL BE USED  TO  SUPPLEMENT
 ANY  PRIOR  YEAR'S EXPENDITURES. THE COMMISSIONER MAY GRANT AN EXCEPTION
 TO THIS REQUIREMENT IF ANY COUNTY, MUNICIPALITY, OR  OTHER  GOVERNMENTAL
 ENTITY  OR  PUBLIC BODY CAN AFFIRMATIVELY SHOW THAT SUCH AMOUNT OF FUNDS
 PREVIOUSLY EXPENDED IS IN EXCESS OF  THE  AMOUNT  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE
 ASSISTANCE  TO ALL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITHIN THE AREA IN WHICH THE
 FUNDS WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPENDED WHO ARE HOMELESS OR  FACING  AN  IMMINENT
 LOSS OF HOUSING.
  § 621. VOUCHERS  STATEWIDE. NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION SIX HUNDRED ELEVEN
 OF THIS ARTICLE, ANY VOUCHER ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE MAY BE USED
 FOR HOUSING ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL INFORM VOUCHER
 HOLDERS THAT A VOUCHER MAY BE USED ANYWHERE IN THE  STATE  AND,  TO  THE
 EXTENT  PRACTICABLE,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL ASSIST VOUCHER HOLDERS IN
 FINDING HOUSING IN THE AREA OF THEIR CHOICE.
  § 622. APPLICABLE CODES. HOUSING ELIGIBLE  FOR  PARTICIPATION  IN  THE
 HOUSING  ACCESS  VOUCHER  PROGRAM SHALL COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE STATE AND
 LOCAL HEALTH, HOUSING, BUILDING AND SAFETY CODES.
  § 623. HOUSING CHOICE. 1. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ADMINISTER THE  HOUS-
 ING  ACCESS VOUCHER PROGRAM UNDER THIS ARTICLE TO PROMOTE HOUSING CHOICE
 FOR VOUCHER HOLDERS. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL AFFIRMATIVELY  PROMOTE  FAIR
 HOUSING TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER THIS PROGRAM.
  2.  NOTHING  IN  THIS ARTICLE SHALL LESSEN OR ABRIDGE ANY FAIR HOUSING
 OBLIGATIONS PROMULGATED BY  MUNICIPALITIES,  LOCALITIES,  OR  ANY  OTHER
 APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the
 addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule  or  regulation  necessary
 for  the implementation of this act on its effective date are authorized
 to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
