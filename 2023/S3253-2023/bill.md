 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to clarifying the  eligi-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  20  of  section 310 of the executive law, as
 added by chapter 175 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  20. "Small business" as used in this section, unless  otherwise  indi-
 cated,  shall  mean a business which has a significant business presence
 in the state, is independently owned and operated, not dominant  in  its
 field and employs, based on its industry, a certain number of persons as
 determined by the director, but not to exceed three hundred, taking into
 consideration  factors  which  include,  but are not limited to, federal
 small business administration standards pursuant to 13 CFR part 121  and
 any  amendments thereto.  PROVIDED HOWEVER, WHEN DETERMINING THE ELIGI-
 BILITY OF AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY, AS DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED SEVEN-
 TY-ONE OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW, AS A SMALL BUSINESS PURSUANT TO THIS
 SUBDIVISION THERE SHALL BE NO RESTRICTION ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES  OF
 SUCH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY SHALL BE CONSIDERED A SMALL
 BUSINESS  IF  THE  ANNUAL  RECEIPTS OF SUCH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY CALCULATED
 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 13 CFR 121.104 AND ANY AMENDMENTS THERETO,
 ARE LESS THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. The director may issue regulations
 on the construction of the terms in this definition.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law, provided, however, that the amendments to subdivision
 20  of  section 310 of the executive law made by section one of this act
 shall not affect the repeal of such section and shall be  deemed  to  be
 repealed  therewith.  Effective  immediately,  the addition, amendment
 and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation
 of this act on  its  effective  date  are  authorized  to  be  made  and
 completed on or before such effective date.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
