  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Annsville, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Town of Annsville, New York, to
be celebrated with a myriad of events on August 11-12, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Town of Annsville is located in Oneida County between
Camden and  Rome,  the  foothills  of  the  Adirondacks  and  Tug  Hill,
including the Hamlet of Taberg; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1793, John W. Bloomfield traveled from New Jersey up the
Mohawk  Valley  beyond  Fort  Stanwix  to  oversee  some surveying for a
relative; the following year he returned and, with others, invested in a
6,000 acre tract of Scriba's Patent; and
 
  WHEREAS, John and his wife built a log cabin on the site of what  is
now Annsville Elementary School in 1794; they were the first settlers in
the  town  which  bears  the name of John's wife, Ann; the large, white,
pillared house across the street was built in 1822-23 by John's  cousin,
Joseph Bloomfield; and
 
  WHEREAS, John W. Bloomfield built the first sawmill and gristmill in
the  Hamlet  now  known  as  Taberg;  in 1809, the Oneida Iron and Glass
Manufacturing Company began its operation, and in 1811, a blast  furnace
was  built for the production of pig iron; it is also said that shot and
shell were produced here for the War of 1812; and
 
  WHEREAS, Charcoal was  used  in  the  production  of  pig  iron  and
residents  of  Annsville,  particularly  those living on Coal Hill Road,
burned wood to make charcoal which they sold to the iron  company;  this
is where Coal Hill got its name; and
 
  WHEREAS, Elias Brewster of Connecticut settled in Annsville in 1806,
having  lived in Western since 1790; he began clearing land and building
a cabin for his family which arrived in April of 1807; Adam P.  Campbell
and  Nicholas  Armstrong  settled on the meadows in 1805 or 1806, during
which time a man by the name of Wade settled on the Forks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dan Taft and a man by the name of Jones settled near  where
Vincent  Taft  now keeps a public house; for a number of years, Dan Taft
kept a noted tavern on the same premises; the old Taft Hotel  stood  two
and  one-half  miles  southeast  of  Taberg  on  the  state road and was
destroyed by fire in about 1867; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June of 1803, four brothers, Benjamin,  Jonathan,  James
and Abraham Morton, came from Springfield, Massachusetts, and settled in
Northern  Annsville;  in 1805, Jonathan and Samuel Stanford arrived, and
 
Peter Abbott, a Revolutionary War veteran from Windham, Vermont  settled
there  in 1806; Daniel Miller from Granville, Massachusetts also settled
up north in 1804 on a farm subsequently occupied by  John  Whiffen;  his
brother, Eliakim Miller, purchased a farm in 1814; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Town  of  Annsville  was  officially  formed from the
surrounding towns of Lee, Florence, Camden and Vienna on April 12, 1823;
the first town board meeting was held on March  2,  1824,  and  Benjamin
Hyde was elected the first supervisor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The early settlers of Annsville were rugged individualists
clearing land, planting crops, and building cabins to survive; when this
was done, new needs arose which called for working together as  one  for
common  causes; they founded fire brigades, built roads, and established
schools and churches; they raised families and formed  cultural,  social
and  spiritual organizations; they worked to create a sense of community
with values of tolerance, patriotism and moral courage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  same  sense  of  community  and  shared  values  are
reflected in the people and organizations found in Annsville today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  truly charming community, there is a special comfort in
the safety of a small town where the streets are  named  after  familiar
people and landmarks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of historic origin, and remaining fruitful over the ebb and
flow of decades of growth and change, the Town of Annsville continues to
provide the quintessential quality of life for its residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  residents  of  the  Town  of  Annsville have a bright
outlook for the future of their community,  which  remains  a  beautiful
place in which to live, work and raise a family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  Annsville's rich history and enduring
contribution to the State of New York, this Legislative Body is proud to
pay tribute to this  spirited  town  upon  the  occasion  of  its  200th
Anniversary; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the  Bicentennial  of  the  Town  of  Annsville,  New  York,
recognizing  the  significance  of  the role it continues to play in the
life of the community of the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to the Bicentennial Committee of the Town of Annsville, New
York.
