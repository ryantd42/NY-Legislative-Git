 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to ensuring all  students
  enrolled  at  state  university of New York and city university of New
  York institutions are able to express themselves freely  without  fear
  of intimidation or harm

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "college
 and university free speech act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and intent. Section 8 of article 1 of the
 New York State Constitution states that "every citizen may freely speak,
 write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsi-
 ble for the abuse of that right; and no law shall be passed to  restrain
 or abridge the liberty of speech".
  The  legislature  views freedom of speech as an important, fundamental
 right enjoyed by all  Americans  and  institutions  of  higher  learning
 should  be  places  of  information  sharing  and  learning,  productive
 discourse, and free expression.
  The legislature is tasked with ensuring everyone  in  this  state  has
 access  to the highest quality of life, including their higher education
 experience. Therefore,  immediate,  effective  action  is  necessary  to
 protect  all  students,  who would like to be able to express themselves
 without fear of intimidation or harm.
  The legislature has determined that all state university of  New  York
 and  city  university  of New York institutions shall adhere to a policy
 officially recognizing freedom of speech as a fundamental right.
  § 3. The education law is amended by adding a new  section  6438-b  to
 read as follows:
  § 6438-B. COLLEGE  AND  UNIVERSITY  FREE SPEECH. 1. WITHIN ONE HUNDRED
 TWENTY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS  SECTION,  THE  REGENTS  SHALL
 ADOPT  A  POLICY  ON FREE SPEECH THAT APPLIES AT ALL STATE UNIVERSITY OF
