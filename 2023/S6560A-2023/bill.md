 AN ACT to amend the administrative code of the  city  of  New  York,  in
  relation  to  increasing  benefits payable by the correction officers'
  variable supplements fund to beneficiaries

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  13-194 of the administrative code of the city of
 New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 12 to read as follows:
  12. IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENTS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPHS (C) AND (D) OF
 SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION, THERE SHALL BE PAID TO EACH  BENEFICI-
 ARY  ON  OR ABOUT THE DECEMBER FIFTEENTH NEXT SUCCEEDING HIS OR HER DATE
 OF RETIREMENT, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO  THE  VARIABLE  SUPPLEMENTS  PAYMENTS,
 SUBJECT  TO  THE PROVISIONS OF ITEMS (I) AND (II) OF SUBPARAGRAPH ONE OF
 PARAGRAPH (E) OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION, THAT HE OR SHE  WOULD
 HAVE  RECEIVED, HAD HE OR SHE RETIRED ON THE DATE OF HIS OR HER EARLIEST
 ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICE RETIREMENT, IN THE PERIOD MEASURED FROM (1)  THE
 LATER  OF (I) SUCH EARLIEST ELIGIBILITY DATE AND (II) JANUARY FIRST, TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND (2) HIS OR HER DATE OF RETIREMENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This bill provides certain New York  City  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYCERS) Correction officers a lump sum benefit upon
 retirement, commonly referred to as a Deferred  Retirement  Option  Plan
 (DROP),  equal  to the amount of Correction Officer Variable Supplements
 Fund (COVSF) payments such officer would have received if he or she  had
 retired  at  the  later  of their respective earliest service retirement
 eligibility date or January 1, 2024.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND: Correction officers who  participate  in  NYCERS  and  who
 retire with immediate payability of a service retirement at their earli-

 est  service  retirement eligibility date (e.g., after 20 or 25 years of
 credited service) are entitled to receive supplemental non-pension COVSF
 benefits in the amount of $12,000 per calendar year. Correction officers
 who  continue to work beyond their earliest service retirement eligibil-
 ity date are ineligible to receive COVSF payments until retirement, even
 though they would be eligible to retire from service and  receive  COVSF
 benefits.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: This bill would provide to NYCERS correction offi-
 cers  who  continue  to  work  beyond  their earliest service retirement
 eligibility date a lump sum DROP payment consisting of the annual  COVSF
 payment  each year beyond the later of their earliest service retirement
 date or January 1, 2024 (i.e., the COVSF payments the retiree would have
 received if he or she had retired at his or her earliest service retire-
 ment eligibility date or January 1, 2024, whichever  is  later)  without
 any adjustment for interest.
  The DROP does not apply to deaths or to disability retirement, even if
 those  events  occur  after  the earliest service retirement eligibility
 date.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the actuarial  assumptions
 and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation
 would  increase  the Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approxi-
 mately $76.7 million.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  NYCERS,  there  would  be an increase in the Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $42.8 million and  an  increase
 in the Present Value of future employer Normal Cost of $33.9 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions  for New York City of approximately $9.8 million
 which is the result of an increase in the Normal Cost in addition to the
 UAL payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 11 years
 and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over  a  11-year  period
 (10  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag Methodology) using level dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data used in the Preliminary June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS
 to determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  6,711 NYCERS Correction officers as of June 30, 2022 had an aver-
 age age of approximately 42.2 years, and average service of approximate-
 ly 11.6 years.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods in effect
 for the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
 S. 6560  3
 
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The initial additional administrative costs of NYCERS and other New
 York City agencies to implement the proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit (OPEB) costs.
