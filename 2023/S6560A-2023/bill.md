  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  6,097
  - Average Age:  43.0
  - Average Service:  12.4
  - Average Salary:  128,500
 
  IMPACT  ON MEMBER BENEFITS: This proposed legislation would provide to
 NYCERS correction officers who continue to work  beyond  their  earliest
 service  retirement  eligibility date a lump sum DROP payment consisting
 of the annual COVSF payment each year beyond the later of their earliest
 service retirement date or January 1, 2024 (i.e., the COVSF payments the
 retiree would have received if he or she  had  retired  at  his  or  her
 earliest  service retirement eligibility date or January 1, 2024, which-
 ever is later) without any adjustment for interest.
  The DROP would not apply to deaths or to disability  retirement,  even
 if  those events occur after the earliest service retirement eligibility
 date.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and

 2024  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
