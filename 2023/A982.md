 or  caretaker  relative  to engage in work or participate in work activ-
 ities pursuant to the provisions of title nine-B of article five of this
 chapter. Child care assistance shall continue to be guaranteed for  such
 a  family for a period of twelve months or, UPON APPROVAL BY THE OFFICE,

 necessary in order to enable the parent or caretaker relative to  engage
 in  work,  provided  that the family's public assistance has been termi-
 nated as a result of an increase in the hours of or income from  employ-
 ment  or  increased  income  from  child support payments or because the
 family voluntarily ended assistance; that  the  family  received  public
 assistance  in  at  least three of the six months preceding the month in

 hundred  percent  of the state income standard, or three hundred percent

 move.
  § 2. Subdivision 5 of section 410-w of the  social  services  law,  as

 such assistance, shall be deemed eligible for a period of no  less  than
 twelve  months  from  the date of the eligibility determination for such
 assistance [and a], PROVIDED THE FAMILY INCOME DOES NOT  EXCEED  EIGHTY-
 FIVE  PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. A social services district may
 [elect to] extend this period TO up to twenty-four months, PROVIDED  THE
 FAMILY  INCOME  DOES  NOT EXCEED EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN
 INCOME.
  (b) A family eligible for child care assistance under paragraph (a) of
 subdivision one of this section shall suffer  no  break  in  child  care
 services  and  shall  not  be required to reapply for such assistance so
 long as eligibility under subdivision three of this section continues.
  § 3. Section 4 of a chapter of the laws of 2022  amending  the  social
 services  law  relating  to  the  duration  of child care assistance for
 eligible families, as proposed in legislative bills  numbers  S.  9029-A
 and A. 10209-A, is amended to read as follows:
  §  4. This act shall take effect [immediately; provided, however, that
 if section 2 of part L of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022 shall not  have
 taken  effect on or before such date, then section two of this act shall
 take effect on the same date and in the same manner as chapter 56 of the
 laws of 2022 takes effect] ON THE NINETIETH  DAY  AFTER  IT  SHALL  HAVE
 BECOME  A LAW.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY
 SERVICES MAY MAKE ANY RULES AND  REGULATIONS  AS  MAY  BE  NECESSARY  TO
 IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT ON OR BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect immediately; provided that sections
 one and two of this act shall take effect on the same date  and  in  the
 same  manner  as  a  chapter  of  the  laws  of 2022 amending the social
 services law relating to the  duration  of  child  care  assistance  for
 eligible  families,  as  proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 9029-A
 and A.  10209-A, takes effect.
