BY: M. of A. Gandolfo
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 15, 2023, as Police Dog Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  quality  and sanctity of community life are cherished
values, worthy of safeguarding, and this Legislative Body  is  moved  to
honor  those  canines  who  serve  to  preserve and protect such values,
lauding particularly their unwavering  courage  and  dedication  in  the
daily performance of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is appropriate to recognize and commend such outstanding
Police  Dogs  Officers  for their valued contributions to the community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 15, 2023, as Police Dog Day in the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Police
Dog Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Working  dogs  whose  job  it  is  to help law enforcement
protect the public are among the most important canines in our  society;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Scientists  are  not  sure  if  dogs  were  originally
domesticated for their guarding abilities,  it  could  have  been  their
hunting  skills  instead,  but whatever the reason, it did not take long
for ancient humans to start relying on the  dog's  fierce  instinct  for
protection; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  ancient  Romans were one of the first cultures to use
dogs for security; a tour through the  ruins  of  Pompeii,  the  ancient
Roman  city destroyed by a volcano in 79 AD, reveals evidence that guard
dogs protected many of the homes in the city; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the Middle Ages, dogs were used for law  enforcement
in  parts  of  Europe,  mostly  to hunt down criminals; bloodhounds were
preferred in Scotland because of their  superior  ability  to  track  by
scent; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the late 1800s, dogs started to become known as valuable
partners  in  police  work; London police used Bloodhounds to search for
Jack the Ripper in 1888, while other dogs accompanied British police  on
their beats; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first formal training of police dogs began in Belgium
in 1899; he success of this program brought attention  to  the  valuable
help dogs could provide in security work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By 1910, the Germans had made police dogs a common site in
cities throughout the country; they chose the German Shepherd  as  their
breed  of choice, and the first police dog training school was opened in
1920 in the Town of Grunheide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dogs did not become part  of  police  work  in  the  United
States until the 1970s; now, canine officers are common in police forces
throughout  the  United  States; they are also used by the United States
military for patrol and detection work,  and  the  Central  Intelligence
Agency (CIA) for finding and apprehending criminals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most police dogs live with their handlers, and are treated
like family pets when they are off duty; they often  form  strong  bonds
with  their  handlers,  and  are  considered  important  partners  in
maintaining law and order by police officials around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is pleased to recognize  the  efforts
of  the  valiant  and brave police dogs who devoted themselves to public
service, demonstrating great courage and diligence in providing for  the
care  and  welfare  of  the citizens of their communities and this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 15, 2023, as Police
Dog Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
