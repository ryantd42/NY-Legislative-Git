  COMMENDING  the Pride Center of Staten Island upon
  the occasion of hosting its  Pridefest  Festival  on

  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes the profound impact of
those exemplary organizations within the great State of New  York  which
proactively  work  for  the enfranchisement of minority communities, and
the importance of such work for the benefit  of  all  citizens  of  this
State, and indeed, all citizens of the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Pride Center of Staten Island upon the occasion of hosting
its Pridefest Festival on May 27,  2023,  at  Staten  Island  University
Hospital  Community  Park,  in  conjunction with the observance of Pride
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pride Center of Staten Island enhances and sustains the
well-being of the LGBTQIA+ and allied communities by providing  programs
and services which cultivate community; advocate for LGBTQIA+ interests;
educate and empower, and provide social support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  organization  envisions a Staten Island where
LGBTQIA+ people and families are  empowered  to  achieve  their  fullest
potential,  where  people of all sexual orientations, gender identities,
races, ethnicities, and  abilities  are  valued  and  feel  a  sense  of
belonging,  and  where  allies  support identities and interests outside
their own; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pride Center's work is driven by the needs, wants,  and
interests  of  the  LGBTQIA+ community; while social stigma has isolated
and silenced LGBTQIA+ people, the Pride Center of Staten Island believes
that together, we can imagine and create a better future for all  Staten
Islanders; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pride Center of Staten Island strives to create a brave
space  where  people  respect  one  another,  acknowledge the difference
between intention and impact, and make space for diversity  of  thought;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  Center  promotes diversity, equity, and
inclusion of all people from all  races  and  ethnicities,  people  with
disabilities, and people of faith; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pride Center of Staten Island also recognizes allies as
powerful voices that can help advance LGBTQIA+ interests; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  the  Pride Center of Staten Island is in
direct correlation to the  efforts  of  its  Executive  Director,  Carol
Bullock,  as  well  as  its  dedicated  staff, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Our society is greatly benefited by the purposeful efforts
of those organizations and individuals which  unite  for  the  cause  of
improving  the  quality  of life for others, and proactively work toward
the goal of dignity for all; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  and  events  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Pride Center of Staten Island upon the occasion  of  hosting
its  Pridefest  Festival  on  May  27,  2023,  in  conjunction  with the
