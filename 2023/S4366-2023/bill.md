  e.(1)  At  the  beginning  of each fourth calendar year, commencing in
 nineteen hundred  ninety-five,  the  state  board  shall  determine  the
 percentage  of  the difference between the most recent available monthly
 consumer price index for all urban consumers  published  by  the  United
 States  bureau  of  labor  statistics  and  such  consumer  price  index
 published for the same month four years previously. The amount  of  each

 amount of such percentage difference to the closest one hundred  dollars
 by  the  state  board which, not later than the first day of February in
 each such year, shall issue a regulation publishing the amount  of  each
 such contribution limit. Each contribution limit as so adjusted shall be
 the  contribution  limit in effect for any election held before the next
 such adjustment.
  (2) Provided, however, that  such  adjustments  shall  not  occur  for
 candidates seeking statewide office, or the position of state senator or
 member  of the assembly, whether such candidate does or does not partic-
 ipate in the public finance program established pursuant to title two of
 this article.
  f. Notwithstanding any  other  contribution  limit  in  this  section,
 participating  candidates  as defined in subdivision fourteen of section
 14-200-a of this article may contribute, out of their own  money,  three
 times  the applicable contribution limit to their own authorized commit-
 tee.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
