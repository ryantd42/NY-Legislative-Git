  4. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT, OR TO ENLARGE,
 THE PROTECTIONS THAT 47 U.S.C § 230 CONFERS ON AN  INTERACTIVE  COMPUTER
 SERVICE FOR CONTENT PROVIDED BY ANOTHER INFORMATION CONTENT PROVIDER, AS
 SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN 47 U.S.C. § 230.
  UNLAWFUL DISSEMINATION OR PUBLICATION OF FILES OR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
 DIGITAL MANUFACTURE OF A FIREARM OR COMPONENTS IS A CLASS C FELONY.
  §  2.  Subdivision 3 of section 265.00 of the penal law, as amended by
 chapter 211 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  3. "Firearm" means (a) any pistol or revolver; or (b) a shotgun having
 one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length; or (c) a  rifle
 having  one  or  more barrels less than sixteen inches in length; or (d)
 any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle whether by alteration, modifica-
 tion, or otherwise if such weapon as altered, modified, or otherwise has
 an overall length of less than twenty-six  inches;  or  (e)  an  assault
 weapon;  or  (f)  A  DIGITALLY  MANUFACTURED  FIREARM  OR COMPONENT OF A
 FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN AS DEFINED IN SECTION 265.67 OF THIS  ARTICLE;
 OR  (G)  any  other weapon that is not otherwise defined in this section
 containing any component that provides housing or a  structure  designed
 to  hold  or integrate any fire control component that is designed to or
 may readily be converted to expel a projectile by action  of  explosive.
 For  the purpose of this subdivision the length of the barrel on a shot-
 gun or rifle shall be determined by measuring the distance  between  the
 muzzle  and  the face of the bolt, breech, or breechlock when closed and
 when the shotgun or rifle is cocked; the overall length of a weapon made
 from a shotgun or rifle is the distance between the extreme ends of  the
 weapon  measured  along  a line parallel to the center line of the bore.
 Firearm does not include an antique firearm.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
