  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 the "fairness and opportunity for incarcerated workers act".
  §  2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby declares
 that:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6747--A  2
 
  1. The current system of prison labor in New York is an  outgrowth  of
 the  legacy  of  slavery  and  has been allowed to continue in our state
 because of the exception created in the 13th Amendment  which  abolished
 slavery "except as punishment for a crime."
  2.  The  history  of  prison  labor  in New York can be traced back to
 Auburn Prison, where a cruel and dehumanizing system of forced labor was
 established 200 years ago with the goal of  creating  a  self-sustaining
 prison system.
  3.  Today, incarcerated individuals are forced to work under threat of
 punishment; hourly wages range from ten to sixty-five cents an hour  and
 have  not  increased  since  1993;  work  conditions are unsafe and have
 resulted in serious injury and even death; assigned  work  programs  are
 insufficient  to  provide  incarcerated  individuals with the skills and
 training necessary for successful rehabilitation,  reentry  and  reinte-
 gration into the community; and there currently exists no means by which
 incarcerated  individuals  can  organize  to work toward improving these
 conditions.
  4. The labor of incarcerated  individuals  has  been  used  to  create
 millions of dollars of profits and cost-savings for the state.
  5.  The  current system of prison labor is a violation of human rights
 and an affront to human dignity.
  6. The Fairness and Opportunity for Incarcerated Workers Act will: end
 forced labor; provide for a  minimum  wage,  healthy  and  safe  working
 conditions,  and  the  right  to  organize;  and  require  that all work
 programs provide incarcerated individuals with the skills  and  training
 necessary for successful rehabilitation, reentry, and reintegration into
 the  community.  The  act  also establishes a labor board to ensure that
 these requirements are met; provides a means of redress  if  labor  laws
 are violated; and eliminates Corcraft's preferred vendor status.
  §  3.  Section  2  of  the correction law is amended by adding two new
 subdivisions 35 and 36 to read as follows:
  35. "LABOR PROGRAM" MEANS ANY  JOB  OR  WORK  WHEREBY  THE  DEPARTMENT
 EMPLOYS,  ASSIGNS  OR  PERMITS  AN  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL  TO PROVIDE
 SERVICES IN ANY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, JAIL, REFORMATORY OR OTHER INSTI-
 TUTION IN THE STATE AND FOR WHICH THE MINIMUM WAGE ESTABLISHED BY  ARTI-
 CLE  NINETEEN OF THE LABOR LAW WOULD HAVE BEEN DUE BUT FOR SUCH INDIVID-
 UAL'S CONDITION OF INCARCERATION. LABOR PROGRAMS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT  NOT
 BE  LIMITED  TO,  CORCRAFT  PRISON  INDUSTRY  JOBS, FACILITY NEEDS JOBS,
 KITCHEN, LAUNDRY, LIBRARY,  GROUNDSKEEPING  AND  OTHER  IN-HOUSE  PRISON
 OPERATION  AND  UPKEEP  WORK, AND ANY OTHER WORK WHEREBY THE LABOR OF AN
 INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL IS CONTRACTED, LET, FARMED OUT, GIVEN OR SOLD TO
 THE STATE, ANY SUBDIVISION THEREOF, OR ANY PUBLIC, NONPROFIT OR  PRIVATE
 ENTITY, SHAREHOLDER OR INDIVIDUAL.
  36. "LABOR BOARD" MEANS THE PRISON LABOR BOARD ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO
 SECTION 200-A OF THIS CHAPTER.
  §  4.  Section 116 of the correction law, as amended by chapter 322 of
 the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  § 116. [incarcerated] INCARCERATED individuals' funds. The  warden  or
 superintendent  of  each  of the institutions within the jurisdiction of
 the department of corrections and community supervision shall deposit at
 least once in each week to [his or her] SUCH WARDEN OR  SUPERINTENDENT'S
 credit  as  such warden, or superintendent, in such bank or banks as may
 be designated by the comptroller, all the moneys  received  by  [him  or
 her] SUCH WARDEN OR SUPERINTENDENT as such warden, or superintendent, as
 incarcerated individuals' funds, and send to the comptroller and also to
 the commissioner monthly, a statement showing the amount so received and
 S. 6747--A  3
 
 deposited.  Such  statement of deposits shall be certified by the proper
 officer of the bank receiving such deposit or deposits. The  warden,  or
 superintendent,  shall also verify by [his or her] SUCH WARDEN OR SUPER-
 INTENDENT'S  affidavit  that  the  sum  so  deposited  is  all the money
 received by [him or her] SUCH WARDEN OR SUPERINTENDENT  as  incarcerated
 individuals'  funds  during  the  month. Any bank in which such deposits
 shall be made shall, before receiving any such  deposits,  file  a  bond
 with  the  comptroller  of the state, subject to [his or her] SUCH COMP-
 TROLLER'S approval, for such sum as [he or she] SUCH  COMPTROLLER  shall
 deem necessary. Upon a certificate of approval issued by the director of
 the  budget,  [pursuant  to the provisions of section fifty-three of the
 state finance law,] the amount of interest, if any,  heretofore  accrued
 and hereafter to accrue on moneys so deposited, heretofore and hereafter
 credited  to  the  warden,  or  superintendent, by the bank from time to
 time, shall be [available for expenditure by the warden, or  superinten-
 dent,  subject  to  the  direction of the commissioner, for welfare work
 among the incarcerated individuals in his or her custody. The withdrawal
 of moneys so deposited by such warden, or superintendent, as incarcerat-
 ed individuals' funds, including any  interest  so  credited,  shall  be
 subject  to  his  or  her check] DESIGNATED AS INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S
 FUNDS.  Each warden, or superintendent, shall  each  month  provide  the
 comptroller  and  also the commissioner with a record of all withdrawals
 from incarcerated individuals' funds. As used in this section, the  term
 "  incarcerated individuals' funds" means the funds in the possession of
 the incarcerated individual at the time of [his or her] SUCH INCARCERAT-
 ED INDIVIDUAL'S admission into the institution, funds earned by [him  or
 her]  SUCH  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL  as provided in section one hundred
 eighty-seven of this chapter, INTEREST ACCRUED ON SUCH  FUNDS,  and  any
 other  funds received by [him or her] SUCH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL or on
 [his or her] SUCH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S behalf  and  deposited  with
 such  warden  or  superintendent  in accordance with the rules and regu-
 lations of the commissioner. [Whenever the total unencumbered  value  of
 funds  in  an  incarcerated  individual's  account  exceeds ten thousand
 dollars, the superintendent shall give written notice to the  office  of
 victim services.]
