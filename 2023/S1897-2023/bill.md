 ASSESSMENTS  PREVIOUSLY  ESTABLISHED  FOR  THE PRIOR INCREASE; PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THAT IF IN ANY YEAR ANY SUCH TRANSITION ASSESSMENT EXCEEDS  THE

 AND  ARTICLE  TWELVE-B  OF  THIS CHAPTER, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL USE THE
 TRANSITION ASSESSMENTS AS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SUBDIVISION IN ITS DETER-

 ASSESSMENT SHALL BE SO USED.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
