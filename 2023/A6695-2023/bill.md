  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Clause 10 of subparagraph (i) of the opening  paragraph  of
 section  1210  of  the  tax  law,  as  amended by section 1 of item A of
 subpart C of part XXX of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  (10)  the  county of Albany is hereby further authorized and empowered
 to adopt and amend local laws, ordinances or resolutions  imposing  such
 taxes  at  a  rate  which is one percent additional to the three percent
 rate authorized above in this paragraph for such county for  the  period
 beginning September first, nineteen hundred ninety-two and ending Novem-
 ber thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-FIVE;
  §  2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, if the county
 of Albany imposes the additional one percent rate of sales  and  compen-
 sating  use  taxes authorized by section one of this act for any portion
 of the period during which the county is so authorized  to  impose  such
 additional  one  percent  rate of such taxes, then such county of Albany
 shall allocate and distribute quarterly to the cities and  the  area  in
 the  county  outside  the  cities the same proportion of net collections
 attributable to such additional one percent rate of such taxes  as  such
 county is allocating and distributing the net collections from the coun-
 ty's three percent rate of such taxes as of the date this act shall have
 become  a  law, and such portion of net collections attributable to such
 additional one percent  rate  of  such  taxes  shall  be  allocated  and
 distributed  to the towns and villages in such county in the same manner
 as the net collections attributable to such county's three percent  rate
 of  such  taxes are allocated and distributed to such towns and villages

 not be required to allocate and distribute net collections in accordance
 with  the previous sentence for any period of time during which any such
 city tax is in effect.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
