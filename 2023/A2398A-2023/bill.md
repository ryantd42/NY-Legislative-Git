  § 66-U. MICROGRID DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. 1. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS
 SECTION:
  (A) "COMMUNITY OUTAGE ASSET" MEANS A PUBLIC  OR  PRIVATE  ENTITY  THAT
 PROVIDES  CRITICAL  SERVICES  TO  THE PUBLIC DURING AN EXTENDED ELECTRIC
 DISTRIBUTION OUTAGE. COMMUNITY OUTAGE ASSETS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT ARE  NOT
 LIMITED  TO:  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  PROVIDERS, HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES,
 LARGE RETAIL STORES, SUPERMARKETS, GOVERNMENT  AGENCIES,  DATA  CENTERS,
 TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEMS,  FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS,  GAS STATIONS, EDUCA-
 TIONAL INSTITUTIONS, LARGE MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HOUSING,  WASTEWATER
 TREATMENT  FACILITIES,  COMMUNITY  CENTERS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS DEEMED BY
 THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL SERVICE TO THE  PUBLIC  THAT  WOULD
 PROMOTE  OR  ENHANCE  HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING AN OUTAGE OF THE ELECTRIC
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM;
  (B) "EXTENDED ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION OUTAGE" MEANS A TOTAL  OR  PARTIAL
 OUTAGE  OF  AN ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT CONTINUES
 FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OR LONGER;
  (C) "UNINTERRUPTED" MEANS THAT THE OUTPUT OF THE MICROGRID  SYSTEM  IS
 DELIVERED  TO  THE  END-USE  CUSTOMER  THROUGHOUT  AN  EXTENDED ELECTRIC
 DISTRIBUTION OUTAGE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MOMENTARY INTERRUPTIONS ASSO-
 CIATED WITH TRANSITIONS TO AND FROM  GRID  PARALLEL  AND  GRID  ISLANDED

  (D) "MICROGRID" SHALL MEAN A LOAD OR GROUP OF INTERCONNECTED LOADS AND
 DISTRIBUTED  ENERGY  RESOURCES WITHIN CLEARLY DEFINED ELECTRICAL BOUNDA-
 RIES THAT ACTS AS A SINGLE CONTROLLABLE ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE ELEC-
 TRIC GRID.  A MICROGRID CAN CONNECT AND  DISCONNECT  FROM  THE  ELECTRIC
 GRID TO ENABLE IT TO OPERATE IN BOTH GRID-CONNECTED OR ISLAND-MODE.

 SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL, AFTER A HEARING HELD ON NOTICE, ADOPT  AN
 ORDER  REQUIRING  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE  ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 TIVE  TO  MARGINAL GRID EMISSIONS FOR THE REGION IN WHICH THE PROJECT IS
 LOCATED. FOR PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  DEFINE
 MARGINAL  EMISSIONS  USING  THE  SAME METRIC OR METRICS THAT ARE USED TO
 QUANTIFY EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED BY OTHER NEW  YORK  STATE  ENERGY

  (B)  DISPLACE  OR  OTHERWISE  REDUCE  THE  OPERATION OF DIESEL BACK-UP
 GENERATORS; AND
  (C) ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING EXPEDITIOUSLY PERMITTED,  INTERCONNECTED
