  COMMENDING  seven  brave  Airmen from the New York
  Air National Guard's  106th  Rescue  Wing  upon  the
  occasion  of  their designation as recipients of the
  Air Force Commendation Medal for their heroic action
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  seven brave Airmen from the New York Air National Guard's 106th
Rescue Wing upon the occasion of their designation as recipients of  the
Air  Force Commendation Medal for their heroic action taken on April 24,
2017; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  seven  Airmen  consist  of  Combat  Rescue  Officers
Lieutenant  Colonel  Edward  Boughal  and  Major  Marty  Viera,  and
Pararescuemen Master Sergeant Jordan St. Clair, Senior  Master  Sergeant
Erik  Blom,  Master  Sergeant  Jedediah  Smith,  Staff  Sergeant Michael
Hartman, and Master Sergeant Bryan Dalere; and
 
  WHEREAS, Their noble mission was to provide emergency care  for  two
sailors on the Slovenian bulk carrier Tamar who had been badly burned in
an explosion 1,700 miles off the coast of Long Island, New York; the men
had  to  acquire  medical  supplies  from  local  hospitals and mitigate
maintenance issues of their aircraft mid-flight before flying  out  over
the  ocean,  dropping equipment packages and two inflatable Zodiac boats
on target to begin their rescue mission; and
 
  WHEREAS, With  every  aspect  of  their  mission  presenting  unique
challenges,  the pararescue team had to climb into the Zodiacs, retrieve
the floating supplies, head to the ship, and board the Tamar on  a  rope
ladder while 15-foot waves tossed the boat up and down; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Along  with  the distance and the jump, once on board, the
106th Airmen had to conduct emergency surgery, provide medical care  for
three  days  as  the ship approached the Azores, then ensure the injured
victims were airlifted onto a Portuguese helicopter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Colonel  Jeffrey  Cannet,  the  commander  of  the  106th
Operations  Group,  who piloted the HC-130 search and rescue aircraft on
the mission, praised those who jumped into  the  ocean  that  night;  he
described  the  success  of  the  Airmen  involved  in  the mission as a
testament to their skill and ability; and
 
  WHEREAS, Col. Cannet, Lt. Col. Boughal, and Master  Sgt.  St.  Clair
credited  Lt.  Col.  Stephen Rush, the 106th Medical Group Commander and
103rd Rescue Squadron Wing Flight Surgeon, for having such a huge impact
on the medical capabilities  of  the  entire  pararescue  career  field,
preparing the team to be elite medical professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The professionalism and dedication of the men and women of
the 106th Rescue Wing and its commitment to the pararescue creed,  "that
others  may  live," shall not go unnoticed by this Legislative Body, and
is a testament to the meaning of what it means to be a  citizen  of  the
State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the seven brave Airmen from the New York  Air  National  Guard's
106th  Rescue  Wing upon the occasion of their designation as recipients
of the Air Force Commendation Medal for their heroic action; and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the seven honored Airmen from the New York  Air  National
Guard's 106th Rescue Wing.
