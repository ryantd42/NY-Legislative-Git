 S. 2762  2
 
  § 5. Section 2 of chapter 579 of the laws of 2008 amending the general
 business law relating to zone pricing of gasoline is amended to read  as
 follows:
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares  that for the past several years motor fuel prices have greatly
 fluctuated. In some cases, price  fluctuations  are  caused  by  natural
 market  conditions.  In other cases, fluctuations result from artificial
 manipulation of the market. One such artificial pricing manipulation  is
 zone  pricing. Zone pricing is the setting of different wholesale prices
 for retail motor fuel [that operate in different geographic areas] BASED
 ON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. Zone pricing increases the price of retail motor
 fuel for certain consumers, leading to inequities  among  consumers  and
 regions  around  the state.  Therefore, the legislature hereby declares
 that while natural market occurrences may lead  to  price  fluctuations,
 artificial  changes  in  motor  fuel prices unfairly harm many consumers
 around the state.
  § 6. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
