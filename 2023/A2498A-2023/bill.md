 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative intent and purpose. In order to best  organize
 and  sustain an environmentally sensitive statewide system of trails for
 all terrain vehicles, the legislature hereby creates an ATV trail  fund.
 The control and supervision of the trail fund shall be maintained by the
 office  of parks, recreation and historic preservation upon consultation
 with the department of environmental conservation.  The  trail  fund  is
 created  for  the  purpose  of  designating state, municipal and private
 lands as part of a statewide network of ATV trails. Fees obtained by the
 office of parks, recreation and historic preservation  for  the  mainte-
 nance  of  the  trail  fund  shall  be  divided  between administration,
 enforcement, education and remediation and maintenance, construction and
 development of the statewide trail system.  It is the  purpose  of  this
 act  to  promote  the  safe  and  proper use of all terrain vehicles for
 recreation and commerce in this  state  by  encouraging  their  use  and
 development,  while  minimizing detrimental effects of such use upon the
 environment.
