 COURT AND THE DRUG DEALER A WRITTEN STATEMENT SETTING FORTH THE DETERMI-
 NATIONS SOUGHT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOGETHER WITH  THE  REASONS  FOR
 SEEKING  SUCH  DETERMINATIONS.  THE COURT SHALL ALLOW THE DRUG DEALER TO

 HIS OR HER DESIGNEE, WHO SHALL BEAR THE  BURDEN  OF  PROVING  THE  FACTS

 THE  ORDER  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES FIFTY-FIVE, FIFTY-SIX
 AND FIFTY-SEVEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES. WHERE  COUNSEL  HAS
 BEEN ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT THE DRUG DEALER UPON THE GROUND THAT THE DRUG
 DEALER IS FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO RETAIN COUNSEL, THAT ASSIGNMENT SHALL BE

 BE  CLASSIFIED  AS  A LEVEL 3 DEALER (RISK OF REPEAT OFFENSE IS HIGH), A
 LEVEL 2 DEALER (RISK OF REPEAT OFFENSE IS MODERATE), OR A LEVEL 1 DEALER

 ANY STATE OR FEDERAL STATUTE. EITHER PARTY MAY APPEAL AS OF  RIGHT  FROM
 THE  ORDER  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES FIFTY-FIVE, FIFTY-SIX

  (B)  OTHER  CRIMINAL  HISTORY  FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING
 RISK, INCLUDING THE NUMBER, DATE AND NATURE OF PRIOR OFFENSES;
  (C) CONDITIONS OF RELEASE THAT MINIMIZE RISK OF RE-OFFENSE,  INCLUDING
 BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO  WHETHER  THE  DRUG DEALER IS UNDER SUPERVISION OR
 RESIDING IN A HOME SITUATION THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE AND SUPERVISION; AND
  (D) RECENT BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING BEHAVIOR WHILE CONFINED.
  6. THE GUIDELINES SHALL BE APPLIED BY THE BOARD TO MAKE A  RECOMMENDA-
 TION  TO  THE SENTENCING COURT WHICH SHALL BE CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL NOT
 BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION, PROVIDING FOR ONE OF  THE  FOLLOWING
 THREE  LEVELS  OF  NOTIFICATION DEPENDING UPON THE DEGREE OF THE RISK OF
 RE-OFFENSE BY THE DRUG DEALER.
  (A) IF THE RISK OF REPEAT OFFENSE IS  LOW,  A  LEVEL  ONE  DESIGNATION
 SHALL  BE  GIVEN  TO  SUCH DRUG DEALER. IN SUCH CASE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
 A. 3388  13

 AGENCY OR AGENCIES HAVING JURISDICTION AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR

 TION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AT WHICH THE DRUG DEALER IS ENROLLED,  ATTENDS,
 IS EMPLOYED OR RESIDES.
  (B) IF THE RISK OF REPEAT OFFENSE IS MODERATE, A LEVEL TWO DESIGNATION
 SHALL  BE  GIVEN  TO  SUCH DRUG DEALER. IN SUCH CASE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCY OR AGENCIES HAVING JURISDICTION AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR
 AGENCIES HAVING HAD JURISDICTION AT THE TIME OF HIS  OR  HER  CONVICTION
 SHALL  BE  NOTIFIED AND MAY DISSEMINATE RELEVANT INFORMATION WHICH SHALL
 INCLUDE A PHOTOGRAPH AND DESCRIPTION OF THE DEALER AND WHICH MAY INCLUDE

 COURT TO RENDER A DETERMINATION WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THIS
 ARTICLE  SHALL  NOT AFFECT THE OBLIGATION OF THE DRUG DEALER TO REGISTER
 OR VERIFY UNDER THIS ARTICLE NOR SHALL SUCH FAILURE PREVENT A COURT FROM
 MAKING A DETERMINATION REGARDING THE DRUG DEALER'S LEVEL OF NOTIFICATION
 AND WHETHER SUCH DEALER IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE REGISTERED FOR A PERIOD
 OF TWENTY YEARS OR FOR LIFE. WHERE A COURT IS UNABLE TO MAKE A  DETERMI-
 NATION  PRIOR  TO  THE  DATE  SCHEDULED  FOR  A DRUG DEALER'S DISCHARGE,

 FOUND  TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSIGNED COUNSEL IN THE UNDERLYING CASE. WHERE
 SUCH A FINDING WAS PREVIOUSLY MADE, THE COURT SHALL  ASSIGN  COUNSEL  TO
 REPRESENT  THE DEALER, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE EIGHTEEN-B OF THE COUNTY LAW.

 NOTIFICATION SOUGHT, TOGETHER WITH THE REASONS FOR SEEKING SUCH DETERMI-
 NATION. THE DRUG DEALER SHALL BEAR  THE  BURDEN  OF  PROVING  THE  FACTS
 SUPPORTING  THE REQUESTED MODIFICATION BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE.
 SUCH A PETITION SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED MORE  THAN  ANNUALLY.  IN  THE

 TION IS GRANTED, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MAY APPEAL AS OF RIGHT  FROM  THE
 ORDER  PURSUANT  TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES FIFTY-FIVE, FIFTY-SIX AND
 FIFTY-SEVEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES. WHERE COUNSEL HAS  BEEN
 ASSIGNED  TO  REPRESENT  THE  DRUG  DEALER UPON THE GROUND THAT THE DRUG

 HAS BEEN A DETERMINATION AFTER A PROCEEDING PURSUANT TO  SECTION  410.70

 FOR SEEKING SUCH DETERMINATION. THE DISTRICT  ATTORNEY  SHALL  BEAR  THE
 BURDEN  OF  PROVING  THE FACTS SUPPORTING THE REQUESTED MODIFICATION, BY
 CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
 PETITION IS GRANTED, THE DRUG DEALER MAY APPEAL AS  OF  RIGHT  FROM  THE
 ORDER,  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES FIFTY-FIVE, FIFTY-SIX AND
 FIFTY-SEVEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES. WHERE COUNSEL HAS  BEEN

 DEALER ON WHICH THE DRUG DEALER MAY APPLY FOR ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL.  IF
 THE  DRUG  DEALER  APPLIES FOR ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL AND THE COURT FINDS
