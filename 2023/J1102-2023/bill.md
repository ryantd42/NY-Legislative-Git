  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge
outstanding  athletes  who  distinguished  themselves  through  their
exceptional performance, attaining unprecedented success and the highest
level  of personal achievement; JoAnn Hagen was one such athlete and her
life of athletic achievements inspired others  and  contributed  to  the
respect and admiration of the sport of boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
JoAnn Hagen upon the occasion of being inducted into  the  International

Canastota, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born as JoAnn Verhagen in South Bend, Indiana, JoAnn  Hagen
was  working  at  the Bendix brake manufacturing factory, when she hit a
co-worker who was  threatening  her  with  uninvited  advances  and  the
incident  was  witnessed  by the brother of local boxing promoter Johnny
Nate; before long, she was a regular at his boxing gym; and
 
  WHEREAS, JoAnn Hagen competed in matches throughout the Midwest;  in
1954, she made history as the only boxer to defeat Barbara Buttrick when
she  scored  an  eight-round decision in front of 1,200 fans in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada in the first women's  bout  to  be  broadcast  over  the
radio; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Making  major media appearances including the popular game
show "What's My Line?" and "The Steve Allen Show,"  JoAnn  Hagen  helped
female boxing's profile; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After retiring in 1956, JoAnn Hagen enlisted in the Marine
Corps and lived in South Bend until she passed away in 2004 at  the  age
of 73; and
 
  WHEREAS,  JoAnn  Hagen  clearly made a contribution to the spirit of
excellence which is a tradition of  the  International  Boxing  Hall  of
Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such outstanding athletic accomplishments are brought  to
our  attention,  they  should  be recognized by all the citizens of this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  JoAnn Hagen posthumously upon the occasion of being inducted into
the International Boxing Hall of Fame on June 10-11,  2023;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of JoAnn Hagen.
