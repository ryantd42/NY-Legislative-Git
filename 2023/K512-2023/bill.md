  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
certain months that are designated to  raising  awareness  of  important
issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  2023,  as  Brain  Aneurysm
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  mission  of  Brain  Aneurysm  Awareness  Month  is to
increase public awareness of brain aneurysms and the signs and  symptoms
of this serious medical condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  brain aneurysm, also referred to as a cerebral aneurysm
or intracranial aneurysm (IA), is a weak bulging spot on the wall  of  a
brain  artery;  as  the  artery  wall becomes gradually thinner from the
dilation, the blood flow causes the  weakened  wall  to  swell  outward,
which  may  cause the aneurysm to rupture and allow blood to escape into
the space around the brain; and
 
  WHEREAS, Small un-ruptured aneurysms can often be monitored  and  do
not always require surgery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Large  brain aneurysms are more dangerous and symptoms may
include severe headache, dilated pupils, double vision, pain  above  and
behind  the  eye,  loss  of  consciousness,  nausea, sudden weakness and
numbness and/or difficulty speaking; all of these mentioned symptoms are
cause for careful evaluation by a physician; and
 
  WHEREAS, Risk factors for aneurysm  rupture  include  smoking,  high
blood pressure, and a family or personal history of a ruptured aneurysm;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  years, the medical treatment of brain aneurysms
has advanced to be  more  effective  and  less  invasive  for  patients;
treatment  or  observation  is  often  used for an aneurysm that has not
ruptured, however, once an aneurysm has ruptured, the options are either
open surgery or an endovascular approach; and
 
  WHEREAS, Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month was first established by the
Brain Aneurysm Foundation to help reduce  aneurysm  rupture  by  raising
awareness  of  the  signs, symptoms and the risk factors associated with
brain aneurysms; it is also a time to encourage individuals to  make  an
appointment  to  be  screened if they have a family history of aneurysm;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023, as Brain
Aneurysm Awareness Month in the State of New York, and to urge  all  New
Yorkers  to  educate  themselves  about  the  signs and symptoms and the
prevention and treatment of brain aneurysms; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of  this  Legislative Resolution, suitably
engrossed, be transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the
State of New York.
