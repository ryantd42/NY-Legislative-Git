 FURNISHES THE INFORMATION TO THE SUPERINTENDENT. IF  THE  SUPERINTENDENT
 REQUESTS  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION LESS THAN TEN DAYS FROM THE EXPIRATION
 OF THE SIXTY DAYS (EXCLUSIVE OF TOLLING), THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY  EXTEND
 THE  SIXTY DAY PERIOD AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY DAYS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION.
 THE APPLICATION OR RATE FILING WILL BE DEEMED  APPROVED  IF  A  DETERMI-
 NATION  IS  NOT RENDERED WITHIN THE TIME ALLOTTED UNDER THIS SECTION. AN
 INSURER SHALL  NOT  IMPLEMENT  A  RATE  ADJUSTMENT  UNLESS  THE  INSURER
 PROVIDES  AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS ADVANCE WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE PREMIUM RATE
 ADJUSTMENT APPROVED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT  TO  EACH  POLICY  HOLDER  AND
 CERTIFICATE HOLDER AFFECTED BY THE RATE ADJUSTMENT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
