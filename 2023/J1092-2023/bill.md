was able to make it to shore, while the other was swept further down the

the welfare of others, personifying the  collective  concern  of  public
servants  across the community of the State of New York who respond when
others are in need of help; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  those
extraordinary  individuals  who  unselfishly  devote  their lives to the
preservation of order and the protection of others are  worthy  and  due
 
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
