 Introduced  by M. of A. RA -- read once and referred to the Committee on
  Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation  to  establishing  the  youth
  apprenticeship program; and making an appropriation therefor (Part A);
  to  amend  the education law, in relation to establishing the enhanced
  regents professional diploma (Part B); and to amend the  tax  law,  in
  relation to establishing a youth apprenticeship tax credit (Part C)
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "learning
 for work act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and intent. According to a recent college
 and career readiness study released by  the  New  York  state  education
 department,  only  thirty-five  percent  of  high  school  graduates are
 college or career ready. This lack of preparedness has driven many  high
 school  graduates  into low-paying jobs, or college degree programs that
 they are not interested in, fail to lead to careers  and  result  in  an
 unreasonably  high  amount  of student debt. For many current and future
 high school students, the traditional pathway of  a  basic  high  school
 education  and  then  on  to  a four-year college may not be the correct
 route to take. These students would benefit from a  program  that  would
 prepare  them  for  employment  immediately upon graduating high school.
 Therefore, the legislature finds it necessary to establish this  "learn-
 ing  for  work"  program  in  our  high schools that will create a youth
 apprenticeship program, an enhanced regents professional diploma with  a
 designation  in  a  specified  occupational  area  and  a tax credit for
 employers who take part in the youth apprenticeship program. This  would
 further  the goals of limiting the accumulation of unsustainable student
 debt, and ensuring all students in the state of New York are prepared to
 enter the twenty-first century workforce.
