 AN ACT to require that the siting,  construction  and  establishment  of
  methadone  program  facilities  in  cities  having a population of one
  million or more be dispersed in the boroughs of such cities in propor-
  tion to the population of each such borough
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, with-
 in  cities having a population of one million or more, methadone program
 facilities registered with the office of addiction services and supports
 pursuant to section 19.16 of the mental hygiene  law  within  each  such
 city  shall  be  sited,  constructed  and/or  established throughout the
 boroughs of such city in proportion to each borough's population to  the
 city's  total population. Provided, however, that the provisions of this
 section shall not apply to the siting, construction or establishment  of
 any methadone program facility for which the appropriate community board
 or,  if  there be no community board, the appropriate neighborhood board
 shall have granted an exemption from such provisions.
  § 2. Methadone program facilities  sited,  constructed  and/or  estab-
 lished  within  cities  having a population of one million or more after
 the effective date of this act shall be first located in those  boroughs
 of  the  city  which have the lowest concentration of such facilities in
 proportion to the borough population to the city's population. Once each
 borough has achieved proper proportionality pursuant  to  this  section,
 siting,  construction,  and/or  establishment  of  such facilities shall
 continue within a city having a population of one million or  more  with
 such proportionality requirements in mind.

 appropriate  neighborhood  board  shall  have  approved  the  siting,
 construction or establishment of such facility.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
