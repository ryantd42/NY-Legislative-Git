 VIDUALS AS COTENANTS, OR SUCH INDIVIDUALS SHARE  IN  THE  PAYMENT  OF  A
 SINGLE  RENT FOR THE RIGHT OF OCCUPANCY OF SUCH RESIDENCE, AND (II) EACH

 DETERMINING  ADJUSTED  RENT  THE  QUALIFIED TAXPAYER SHALL REDUCE RENTAL
 PAID AS FOLLOWS:

 OF THE COMPUTATION OF THE CREDIT, TO AN AMOUNT SUBSTANTIALLY  EQUIVALENT
 TO RENT FOR A COMPARABLE ACCOMMODATION.
  (2)  A  QUALIFIED  TAXPAYER  SHALL  BE ALLOWED A CREDIT AS PROVIDED IN
 PARAGRAPH THREE OF THIS SUBSECTION AGAINST THE  TAXES  IMPOSED  BY  THIS

 EXCEEDS THE TAX AS SO REDUCED FOR SUCH  YEAR  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE,  THE
 EXCESS  SHALL  BE TREATED AS AN OVERPAYMENT, TO BE CREDITED OR REFUNDED,
