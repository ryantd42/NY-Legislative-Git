  Constitution Day and Citizenship Day
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
understand American history and America's First Principles which are the
bedrock values that formed the basis of the American Experiment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each  year,  on  September  17th,  the  American  community
celebrates  Constitution  Day  and Citizenship Day on the anniversary of
the Founding Fathers signing of the U.S. Constitution, on September  17,
1787; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  events that led to the signing of the Constitution of
the United States of America by  the  delegates  of  the  Constitutional
Convention  on  September 17, 1787, have significance for every American
and are honored in public schools across the nation on September 17th of
each year as Constitution Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Louise Leigh founded "Constitution Day, Inc." in 1997 --  a
nonprofit  organization to recognize the importance of the Constitution,
and in 2004, her efforts led to Constitution Day  becoming  an  official
holiday on September 17th; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  origin of Citizenship Day dates to 1940 when "I am an
American Day" was celebrated on the third Sunday in May; then  in  1952,
Congress  moved  the  date to September 17th and renamed it "Citizenship
Day" until 2004, when the official name changed to "Constitution Day and
Citizenship Day"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration
Services  (USCIS)  celebrates  this occasion with special naturalization
ceremonies across the country welcoming hundreds  of  thousands  of  new
citizens from all over the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, In wave after wave through the centuries, people from every
corner  of  the  globe  have come to the shores of America seeking life,
liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and a better life for themselves  and
their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State  consistently ranks second in the largest
number  of  persons  naturalized  by  state  of  residence  annually,
representing  more  than  12%  of  the  National  total  according  to
statistical data from USCIS; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body joins the sentiment of those original
framers, and wishes to demonstrate its continued commitment to the  U.S.
Constitution,  and  extends  a  warm  welcome to people around the world
seeking to become Naturalized United States citizens; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim September 17, 2023, as
Constitution Day and Citizenship Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Constitution  Day  and
Citizenship Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
