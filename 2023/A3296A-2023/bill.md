 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  enacting the "PFAS discharge disclosure act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "PFAS discharge disclosure act".
  § 2. Legislative intent.  The  legislature  finds  and  declares  the
 following:
  1.  PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a class of persist-
 ent,  bioaccumulative,  and  toxic  chemicals  which  have  contaminated
 surface waters and groundwater in New York and across the country.
  2. New York has led the nation by limiting two PFAS--perfluorooctanoic
 acid  (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)--in drinking water
 by setting a maximum contaminant level for these two chemicals. However,
 there are currently no enforceable limits  on  PFAS  discharges  to  our
 waters. Further, those proposing to discharge pollutants into New York's
 waterways  are  not  even  required  to  disclose whether their proposed
 discharges contain PFAS.  Publicly owned treatment works' (POTW)  sewage
 treatment  technology,  for example, is not designed to remove PFAS from
 wastewater, meaning any PFAS introduced into a  POTW  by  an  industrial
 source will pass through into the surface water.
  3. The lack of information about the suite of PFAS chemicals currently
 entering  New York's waterways is a barrier to developing regulations to
 protect people and the environment from the harms of PFAS in our  water-
 ways.
  4.  In  December  2022,  the  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
 published guidance encouraging states to require facilities  discharging

 into  New York's waters, as well as industrial sources discharging waste
 into POTWs, to monitor for and disclose the presence of  PFAS.  Legis-
 lation  is  necessary  to align New York state law with EPA guidance and
 ensure  key  facilities  currently discharging or proposing to discharge
 into waters in New York disclose and monitor their discharges for PFAS.
  § 3. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 17-0833 to read as follows:
 § 17-0833. PFAS DISCHARGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.
