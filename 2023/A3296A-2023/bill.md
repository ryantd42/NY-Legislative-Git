 Introduced by M. of A. KELLES -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  enacting the "PFAS surface water discharge disclosure act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "PFAS surface water discharge disclosure act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. PFAS (per-  and  polyfluoroalkyl  substances)
 are  a  class  of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. PFAS
 have contaminated surface waters and groundwater in New York and  across
 the  country. New York has led the nation by limiting two PFAS--perfluo-
 rooctanoic acid (PFOA)  and  perfluorooctane  sulfonic  acid  (PFOS)--in
 drinking  water  by  setting  a  maximum contaminant level for these two
 chemicals. However, no PFAS--not even PFOA or PFOS--are currently limit-
 ed in discharges to our surface  waters.  Further,  those  proposing  to
 discharge  pollutants into New York's waterways are not even required to
 disclose whether their existing or  proposed  discharges  contain  PFAS.
 Publicly  owned treatment works' (POTW) sewage treatment technology, for
 example, is not designed to remove PFAS  from  wastewater,  meaning  any
 PFAS introduced into a POTW by an industrial user will pass through into
 the surface water. The lack of information about the suite of PFAS chem-
 icals currently entering New York's waterways is a barrier to developing
 regulations to protect people and the environment from the harms of PFAS
 in  our  waterways.  In December 2022, the US Environmental Protection
 Agency (EPA) published guidance encouraging states to require facilities
 discharging into New York's waters, as well as industrial users  sending
 waste  to  POTWs, to monitor for and disclose the presence of PFAS. This
 bill is intended to better align New York state law  with  EPA  guidance
 and  will  ensure  all  facilities currently discharging or proposing to

 discharge into waters in New York disclose and monitor  their  discharge
 for PFAS.
  §  3.  The  environmental  conservation law is amended by adding a new

 § 17-0833. PFAS IN SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.
  1. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS SECTION,  THE  FOLLOWING  TERMS  SHALL
 HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "PERFLUOROALKYL  AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES" OR "PFAS" MEAN A
 CLASS OF FLUORINATED ORGANIC CHEMICALS CONTAINING  AT  LEAST  ONE  FULLY
 FLUORINATED CARBON ATOM.
  (B)  "SPDES  PERMIT"  MEANS  AN AUTHORIZATION OR LICENSE ISSUED BY THE
 DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZING DISCHARGES TO THE WATERS OF THE STATE.
  (C) "PERMITTEE" MEANS THE HOLDER OF A SPDES PERMIT.
  (D) "OUTFALL" MEANS THE TERMINUS OF A SEWER SYSTEM  OR  THE  POINT  OF
 EMERGENCE OF ANY DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE WATERS OF THE STATE.

 THE STATE.
  (F)  "INDUSTRIAL  USER" MEANS A NON-DOMESTIC SOURCE INTRODUCING POLLU-
 TANTS INTO A PUBLICLY OWNED  TREATMENT  WORKS  AS  REGULATED  UNDER  THE
 FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT.
  2.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  REQUIRE  ALL  PERMITTEES  TO MONITOR THEIR
 DISCHARGES AT EACH OUTFALL FOR AT LEAST FORTY SUBSTANCES THAT  ARE  PFAS
 QUARTERLY  FOR  ONE  YEAR.  PERMITTEES  SHALL SUBMIT THE RESULTS OF SUCH

 REQUIREMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT.

 THE PROPOSED DISCHARGE WILL OR MAY CONTAIN ANY PFAS.
  4.  ALL  NEW  SPDES  PERMITS  SHALL  REQUIRE  PERMITTEES  TO  MONITOR
 DISCHARGES FROM EACH OUTFALL FOR AT LEAST FORTY SUBSTANCES THAT ARE PFAS
 AND SUBMIT THE RESULTS OF SUCH MONITORING  WITHIN  NINETY  DAYS  OF  THE
 COMMENCEMENT OF THE DISCHARGE.
  5.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUIRE THAT EVERY PERMITTEE SEEKING TO RENEW
 AN EXISTING SPDES PERMIT SHALL, AS PART OF ITS COMPLETE RENEWAL APPLICA-
 TION, MONITOR FOR AT LEAST FORTY SUBSTANCES  THAT  ARE  PFAS  FROM  EACH

 ING PERMIT.
  6.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL REQUIRE THAT IF A PERMITTEE DETECTS PFAS OF
 ANY AMOUNT IN ITS DISCHARGE FROM ANY OUTFALL, SUCH PERMITTEE SHALL, ON A

  7.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  REQUIRE ANY NEW INDUSTRIAL USER SEEKING TO
