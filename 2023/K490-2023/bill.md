  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 2023, as Children's  Eye  Health  and  Safety
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 2022, as Children's
Eye Health and Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  November 19, 2018, Caitlyn Michiels was diagnosed with
anterior  bilateral  uveitis,  a  rare  eye  disease  which  is  the
third-leading  cause  of blindness in children; unfortunately, she had a
difficult time finding doctors to treat her, many of  whom  saying  they
could not perform treatments on children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through this young girl's tireless efforts, Children's Eye
Health and Safety Awareness Month (Caityln's  Law)  was  passed  by  the
Suffolk  County  Legislature  in  April of 2019; the new law directs the
Suffolk County Health Department to implement updated information  about
eye  health,  and urges families through various programs to get regular
checkups; and
 
  WHEREAS, Anterior uveitis is an inflammation of the middle layer  of
the  eye; this layer includes the iris and the adjacent tissue, known as
the ciliary body; if untreated, it can cause permanent damage  and  loss
of  vision  from the development of glaucoma, cataract or retinal edema;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Signs/symptoms of  anterior  uveitis  may  include  blurred
vision,  sensitivity  to  light,  small (or irregular-shaped) pupil, and
red, sore and inflamed eye; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the symptoms of anterior uveitis are similar to those
of other eye conditions, an optometrist will carefully examine the front
and inside of the eye under a microscope, using  high  magnification  to
determine  if  an  individual  has  this  condition; the doctor may also
perform or arrange for other  diagnostic  tests  to  help  pinpoint  the
cause; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Treatment  of  this  rare  eye  disease  usually  includes
prescription eye drops, which dilate the  pupils,  in  combination  with
anti-inflammatory  drugs;  treatment  usually  takes several days or, in
some cases, several weeks; even  though  it  usually  responds  well  to
treatment, the condition tends to recur; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Anterior  uveitis can result from a trauma to the eye, and
can be associated  with  general  health  problems  such  as  rheumatoid
arthritis,  syphilis,  tuberculosis,  sarcoid,  viral  (herpes  simplex,
herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus) or idiopathic; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  public  awareness, this Legislative Body seeks to
minimize the devastating effects of anterior bilateral uveitis among all
the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 2023, as Children's
Eye  Health  and Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
