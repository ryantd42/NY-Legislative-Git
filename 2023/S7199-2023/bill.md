 AN ACT to amend the cannabis law, in relation to allowing municipalities

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  131  of  the  cannabis law is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 131. Local opt-out; municipal control and  preemption.  1.  (A)  The
 licensure  and  establishment  of  a  retail  dispensary  license and/or
 on-site consumption license under the provisions of article four of this
 chapter authorizing the retail sale of adult-use  cannabis  to  cannabis
 consumers  shall  not  be  applicable  to a town, city or village which,
 after the effective date of this chapter, and, on or before the later of
 December thirty-first, two thousand twenty-one or nine months after  the
 effective  date  of this section, adopts a local law, subject to permis-
 sive referendum governed by section twenty-four of  the  municipal  home
 rule  law,  requesting the cannabis control board to prohibit the estab-
 lishment of such retail dispensary licenses and/or  on-site  consumption
 licenses contained in article four of this chapter, within the jurisdic-
 tion  of the town, city or village. Provided, however, that any town law
 shall apply to the area of the town outside of any village  within  such
 town.  No local law may be adopted after the later of December thirty-
 first, two thousand twenty-one or nine months after the  effective  date
 of  this  section  prohibiting  the  establishment  of retail dispensary
 licenses and/or on-site consumption licenses; provided, however, that  a
 local law repealing such prohibition may be adopted after such date.
  [2.]  (B) Except as provided for in [subdivision one] PARAGRAPH (A) of
 this [section] SUBDIVISION, all county, town, city and village governing
 bodies are hereby preempted from  adopting  any  law,  rule,  ordinance,

 regulation  or  prohibition  pertaining to the operation or licensure of
 registered organizations, adult-use  cannabis  licenses  or  cannabinoid
 hemp  licenses.  However, towns, cities and villages may pass local laws
 and regulations governing the time, place and manner of the operation of
 licensed  adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries and/or on-site consump-
 tion site, provided such law or regulation does not make  the  operation
 of such licensed retail dispensaries or on-site consumption sites unrea-
 sonably impracticable as determined by the board.
  2.  ANY  COUNTY,  TOWN,  CITY  OR VILLAGE MAY ADOPT A LOCAL LAW, RULE,
 ORDINANCE, REGULATION  OR  PROHIBITION  REGARDING  PUBLIC  PLACES  WHERE
 ADULT-USE  CANNABIS  MAY  BE  CONSUMED WITHIN SUCH COUNTY, TOWN, CITY OR
 VILLAGE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
