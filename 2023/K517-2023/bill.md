  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September  2023,  as  Early  Intervention  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  early  years  of  a  child's  life  are  critical  to
development, both physically, mentally and emotionally; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the first few years of life, more  than  1  million  new
neural  connections  are formed every second, making the years 0-3 among
the most important in a child's overall development; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children with developmental delays and disabilities benefit
most when those disabilities are addressed before age 3, with 74 percent
of children who receive Early Intervention Services  demonstrating  make
greater than expected growth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early  Intervention  is  the  term  used  to  describe the
services and supports that are available to babies  and  young  children
under  the  age  of three with developmental delays and disabilities and
their families, including speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational
therapy, counseling and other types of services based on  the  needs  of
the child and family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  services  are  critical  to  a  child's  lifelong
development and provide health, social and economic benefits to a  child
and their family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  York  State  Early  Intervention  Program (EIP),
administered by the State's Department of Health through the  Bureau  of
Early  Intervention,  is part of the national Early Intervention Program
for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their  families;  it  was
first  created  in  Congress  in  1983  under  the  Individuals  with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Early Intervention Program  in
New York State was established in Article 25 of the Public Health Law on
July 1, 1993; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Young  children  across  New  York State are not receiving
timely and comprehensive early childhood developmental  services;  since
2017,  there  has  been  a  27  percent decline in children who received
timely services; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that New York's citizens know about  Early
Intervention  services  available  to  infants  and  toddlers  born with
developmental  delays  and  disabilities  so  that  families  may  take
advantage  of  every opportunity to improve the health and well-being of
their children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Early Intervention services and providers can help a family
learn the best ways to care for their child, how to support and  promote
their  child's  development,  and  how  to  include their child in their
family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS, The observance of Early Intervention Awareness Month in the
State of New York provides an opportunity to recognize the  availability
and  importance of Early Intervention providers and services in New York
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023,  as  Early
Intervention Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
