  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 3635-b of the education

 subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 623 of the laws of 2021, are amended
 to read as follows:
  1.  This  section shall apply where the board of education or trustees
 of a common, central, central high school, union free  school  district,
 or city school district of a city with less than one hundred twenty-five
 thousand  inhabitants  OR  MORE  THAN  ONE  MILLION INHABITANTS adopts a
 resolution to make transportation in child  safety  zones  available  to
 resident  pupils  for  a  particular  school year. Such resolution shall
 continue in effect for subsequent school years until the board adopts  a
 resolution providing otherwise.
  3.  The commissioner of transportation shall establish regulations for
 determination of a hazardous zone including, but not  limited  to,  such
 factors  as  the existence or nonexistence of sidewalks or walkways, the
 type of road surface, width of road, footpath or  sidewalk,  the  volume
 and  average  speed  of  traffic,  density  of population, violent crime
 statistics, density of vacant buildings or structures,  the  commercial,
 industrial  or  residential  character  of the area and the existence or
 nonexistence of traffic safety features such as traffic  lights,  street
 lights  and traffic patrols AND THE LACK OF AVAILABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTA-
 TION. In preparing such regulations, the commissioner of  transportation
 shall consult with the commissioners of education and motor vehicles and
 representatives  from the state police who have traffic safety responsi-
 bilities. Such regulations shall be  used  by  boards  of  education  in
 determining whether a hazardous zone exists.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
