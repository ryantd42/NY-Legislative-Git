 SELECTED OR A COMBINATION OF SUCH FACILITIES WITH OTHER COMMUNITY  RESI-

 LICENSED BY OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF  AREAS
 WITHIN  THE MUNICIPALITY WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED; OR THE SPONSOR-

 BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER TO RESOLVE THE  ISSUE.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 PERSONALLY OR BY A HEARING OFFICER CONDUCT SUCH A HEARING WITHIN FIFTEEN

 SELECTED  AND ANY OTHER FACILITIES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OR IN THE AREA IN
 PROXIMITY TO THE SITE  SELECTED  PROVIDING  RESIDENTIAL  SERVICES  TO  A
 SIGNIFICANT  NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION IF HE OR  SHE  DETERMINES  THAT

 BASED WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED AS A RESULT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
 THE FACILITY. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL MAKE A DETERMINATION WITHIN  THIRTY
 DAYS OF THE HEARING.

 PROGRAM  AS  REQUIRED BY SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION. ANY OPERATING
 CERTIFICATE ISSUED  WITHOUT  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 SECTION SHALL BE CONSIDERED NULL AND VOID AND CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE

 AN OPERATING CERTIFICATE FOR THE OPERATION OF A SUPPORTIVE LIVING FACIL-
