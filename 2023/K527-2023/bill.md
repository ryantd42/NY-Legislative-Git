  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Crossing Guard  Appreciation  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  40,000  children under the age of 14 suffer
from motor vehicle-related pedestrian injuries every year, and more than
half of those injuries require hospitalization; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of these injuries could be  avoided  if  children  had
proper  road-safety education and did not choose to cross streets or use
intersections unsupervised; and
 
  WHEREAS, Crossing Guards are  a  vital  and  integral  part  of  our
educational  system  and  of  the daily lives of children all across the
great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crossing  Guards  are  responsible  for  safely  crossing
children both prior to and at the conclusion of each school day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Parents and schools entrust Crossing Guards with the lives
and  well-being  of  their  children;  the  Crossing  Guard's  primary
responsibility  is  to see that elementary school age children cross the
street in marked crosswalks and in a manner  which  provides  for  their
maximum safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crossing  Guards  also instruct children on how to cross a
street safely when they are alone or an adult is not available to assist
them, whether there is or is not a crossing light; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crossing  Guards  do  an  outstanding  job  of  protecting
children  from  the  hazards  of crossing the street, including the busy
intersections of the State's largest and busiest cities,  including  New
York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crossing  Guards  are  a  welcome  and  familiar part of a
child's day; many know the name of every child who walks  through  their
station, as well as the names of their parents or caretakers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  great  pride,  the Crossing Guards of New York State
have maintained a perfect  record  of  crossing  children  to  and  from
school, in all types of weather, during the school year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  fitting  and  proper  to  acknowledge  and express
appreciation  for  the  labors  of  these  dedicated  individuals  whose
contribution  to  the  protection  of  our  children,  though  not often
recognized, is significant; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  warmly
acknowledge,  commend  and  salute the Crossing Guards of New York State
for their devotion to and  care  of  our  children,  our  most  precious
resource, throughout the year; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Crossing
Guard Appreciation Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
