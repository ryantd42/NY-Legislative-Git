  §  5. Subsection (a) of section 3238 of the insurance law, as added by
 chapter 451 of the laws of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  An insurer, corporation organized pursuant to article forty-three
 of this chapter, municipal cooperative health  benefits  plan  certified
 pursuant  to  article forty-seven of this chapter, or health maintenance
 organization and  other  organizations  certified  pursuant  to  article
 forty-four of the public health law ("health plan") shall pay claims for
 a health care service for which a pre-authorization was required by, and
 received  from,  the  health  plan prior to the rendering of such health
 care service, AND ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMED  ON  THE  DAY  OF  THE  SERVICE,
 unless:
  (1) [(i) the insured, subscriber, or enrollee was not a covered person
 at the time the health care service was rendered.
  (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this para-
 graph, a health plan shall not  deny  a  claim  on  this  basis  if  the
 insured's,  subscriber's or enrollee's coverage was retroactively termi-
 nated more than one hundred twenty days after the  date  of  the  health
 care  service,  provided  that the claim is submitted within ninety days
 after the date of the health care service. If  the  claim  is  submitted
 more  than  ninety  days  after the date of the health care service, the
 health plan shall have thirty days after the claim is received  to  deny
 the  claim on the basis that the insured, subscriber or enrollee was not
 a covered person on the date of the health care service.
  (2)] the submission of the claim with respect to an insured, subscrib-
 er or enrollee was not timely under the terms of the applicable provider
 contract, if the claim is submitted by a  provider,  or  the  policy  or
 contract, if the claim is submitted by the insured, subscriber or enrol-
 lee;
  [(3)]  (2)  at the time the pre-authorization was issued, the insured,
 subscriber or enrollee had not  exhausted  contract  or  policy  benefit
 limitations  based  on  information available to the health plan at such
 time, but subsequently exhausted contract or policy benefit  limitations
 after  authorization was issued; provided, however, that the health plan
 shall include in  the  notice  of  determination  required  pursuant  to
 subsection (b) of section four thousand nine hundred three of this chap-
 ter  and  subdivision  two  of  section  forty-nine hundred three of the
 public health law that the visits authorized might exceed the limits  of
 the  contract  or  policy and accordingly would not be covered under the
 contract or policy;
  [(4)] (3) the pre-authorization was based on materially inaccurate  or
 incomplete  information provided by the insured, subscriber or enrollee,
 the designee of the insured, subscriber or enrollee, or the health  care
 provider  such  that  if  the  correct  or complete information had been
 provided, such pre-authorization would not have been granted; OR
  [(5) the pre-authorized service was related to a  pre-existing  condi-
 tion that was excluded from coverage; or
  (6)] (4) there is a reasonable basis supported by specific information
 available  for review by the superintendent that the insured, subscriber
 or enrollee, the designee of the insured, subscriber or enrollee, or the
 health care provider has engaged in fraud or abuse.
  § 6. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
