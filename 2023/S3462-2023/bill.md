 AN ACT authorizing the International We Love U  Foundation  to  file  an
  application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor from the town of  New  Windsor,  Orange  County  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from  the  International We Love U Foundation an
 application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to  section
 420-a of the real property tax law for the 2022 assessment roll, for the
 parcel  located  in  the  county of Orange at 18 Snake Hill Road in the
 Town of New Windsor otherwise known as Orange County  Tax  Map  district
 section 9, Block 1, Lot 104.2.
  If  accepted,  the  application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the New Windsor town board,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
