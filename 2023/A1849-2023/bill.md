 AN ACT to amend the public health law and the  public  service  law,  in
  relation  to the protection of public health from exposure to radon in
  natural gas

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 radon  and its radioactive progeny are a major cause of lung cancer, and
 that there is no safe exposure level for public health  protection.  New
 York  State  has  benefited from low levels of those elements in natural
 gas delivered to consumers, due  to  the  low  levels  of  radioactivity
 occurring  in the gas from the sources upon which New York has primarily
 relied. However, there is now concern that natural gas may be coming  to
 New York State from sources with high levels of radioactivity from those
 elements.  It  is  the intent of this act to prevent levels of radon and
 its radioactive progeny from exceeding current levels in gas distributed
 to residential and other consumers,  mindful  of  internationally-recog-
 nized  mitigation  action  levels.  It is the intent of this act to only
 regulate the distribution of gas within the state.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new article 35-B  to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 35-B
  RADON
 SECTION 3560. DEFINITIONS.
  3561. PROTECTION FROM RADON.
  3562. GAS CORPORATION REQUIREMENTS.
  §  3560.  DEFINITIONS.  AS  USED  IN  THIS ARTICLE, UNLESS THE CONTEXT
 CLEARLY REQUIRES OTHERWISE:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 1849  2
 
  1. "BQ/M{3}" MEANS BECQUEREL PER CUBIC METER, WHERE 1  BQ  CORRESPONDS
 TO  ONE  RADIOACTIVE  DISINTEGRATION PER SECOND. 100 BQ/M{3} IS EQUAL TO
 2.7 PCI/L.
  2.  "CURIE"  IS  A  UNIT OF RADIOACTIVITY. ONE CURIE IS EQUAL TO 3.7 X
 10{10} RADIOACTIVE DECAYS PER SECOND. ONE PICO CURIE (PCI) IS  1X10{-12}
 CURIES.
  3.  "DELIVERY  POINT"  MEANS,  AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER
 THIS ARTICLE, A POINT IN A GAS CORPORATION'S DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
  4. "GAS" AND "GAS CORPORATION" SHALL HAVE THE SAME  MEANINGS  AS  THEY
 ARE DEFINED AND USED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW.
  §  3561.  PROTECTION  FROM  RADON.  1. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
 COMMISSIONER TO MINIMIZE, THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE ALARA  (AS  LOW
 AS  REASONABLY  ACHIEVABLE) PRINCIPLE, THE RISK TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
 POSED BY EXPOSURE TO RADON AND ITS RADIOACTIVE PROGENY. TO ACHIEVE  THIS
 GOAL,  THE COMMISSIONER MAY CALL FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  AS  NECES-
 SARY TO SUPPORT PERMITTING, MONITORING, COMPLIANCE AUDITING AND ENFORCE-
 MENT ACTION AS DIRECTED BY THE COMMISSIONER.
  2.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  ESTABLISH  A SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING, AND
 (WHERE THE COMMISSIONER  DEEMS  IT  APPROPRIATE)  DESIGNATING,  DELIVERY
 POINTS  WHERE  GAS FROM A PIPELINE IS TRANSFERRED TO A GAS CORPORATION'S
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND PRACTICABLE FOR  MONITORING
 LEVELS  OF  RADON AND ITS RADIOACTIVE PROGENY TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSES OF
 THIS ARTICLE.
  3. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS ESTABLISHED IN  THIS  SECTION,  EVERY
 GAS  CORPORATION  SELLING OR OTHERWISE PROVIDING GAS TO CUSTOMERS IN NEW
 YORK SHALL, CONSISTENT WITH  THIS  ARTICLE,  ESTABLISH  AND  MAINTAIN  A
 PROGRAM  TO  CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR THE LEVEL OF RADON AND ITS RADIOACTIVE
 PROGENY, MEASURED AS GROSS ALPHA ACTIVITY, IN THE NATURAL GAS  DELIVERED
 TO  THE  GAS  CORPORATION  AT EACH DELIVERY POINT, REPORTING SUCH LEVELS
 THROUGH A PUBLICLY-ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE ON A REAL TIME BASIS. THE  PROGRAM
 SHALL  INCLUDE  PROVISION  FOR  GENERATING ALERTS TO THE GAS CORPORATION
 RELATING TO THE MONITORED LEVELS AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES.
  4. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE SYSTEM  FOR
 THE  MONITORING  SYSTEMS  REQUIRED  PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS
 SECTION,  INCLUDING  A  PERIODIC  PHYSICAL  INSPECTION  AND  MEASUREMENT
 PROGRAM  TO  BE  IMPLEMENTED  BY  THE DEPARTMENT AT THE VARIOUS DELIVERY
 POINTS. THIS PROGRAM SHALL BE DESIGNED SO THAT EACH  DELIVERY  POINT  IS
 INSPECTED AND SAMPLED AT LEAST TWICE PER YEAR BY THE DEPARTMENT.
  5. (A) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL MAKE REGULATIONS AND ESTABLISH A PROGRAM
 TO  IMPLEMENT  AND  ENFORCE  THIS ARTICLE. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL COMPLY
 WITH THIS PARAGRAPH WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THIS ARTICLE  SHALL  BECOME  A
 LAW.
  (B)  AS  PART  OF  THIS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM, WHENEVER THE COMMISSIONER
 DETERMINES THAT A GAS CORPORATION IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIRE-
 MENTS OF THIS ARTICLE, HE OR SHE SHALL ISSUE AN ORDER REQUIRING SUCH GAS
 CORPORATION TO COMPLY, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A
 PLAN OF CORRECTION. WHERE NECESSARY, THE COMMISSIONER MAY ORDER THE FLOW
 OF NATURAL GAS AT ANY DELIVERY POINT THAT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH  THE
 REQUIREMENTS  OF THIS ARTICLE BE SHUT OFF UNTIL A GAS CORPORATION BRINGS
 THAT DELIVERY POINT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE. THE  COMMISSIONER
 MAY  IMPOSE  A  CIVIL FINE OF UP TO TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY
 PER DELIVERY POINT ON THE GAS CORPORATION UNTIL THE RADON AND ITS RADIO-
 ACTIVE PROGENY LEVELS AT EACH DELIVERY POINT THAT IS OUT  OF  COMPLIANCE
 HAVE  BEEN  BROUGHT  INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE. THE COMMISSIONER
 MAY COMMENCE A CIVIL ACTION OR PROCEEDING  WHENEVER  A  GAS  CORPORATION
 A. 1849  3
 
 FAILS  TO  COMPLY  WITH  AN  ORDER ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE.
  6. ANY PERSON MAY COMMENCE A CIVIL ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST:
  (A)  ANY  GAS  CORPORATION THAT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIRE-
 MENTS OF THIS ARTICLE, AND
  (B) THE COMMISSIONER IF HE OR SHE FAILS TO ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENTS OF
 THIS ARTICLE, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMISSIONER HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF  THE
 INTENT TO COMMENCE SUCH CIVIL ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND HAS FAILED WITHIN
 THIRTY  DAYS OF RECEIVING SUCH NOTICE TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST
 A GAS CORPORATION THAT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE. THE COURT
 IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY ISSUE  AN  INJUNCTION  OR  OTHER  ORDER
 COMPELLING  COMPLIANCE  AND  SHALL ENTER AN ORDER REQUIRING A GAS CORPO-
 RATION OR THE COMMISSIONER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, TO  PAY  THE  REASONABLE
 LEGAL  FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION THAT

  § 3562. GAS CORPORATION REQUIREMENTS. 1. EACH  GAS  CORPORATION  SHALL
 ESTABLISH  AND  IMPLEMENT  A RADON MITIGATION RESPONSE PROGRAM TO ENSURE

 POINT  SHALL NOT EXCEED:  100 BQ/M{3} (EQUIVALENT TO 2.7 PCI/L) AVERAGED
 OVER ANY ONE HOUR PERIOD, 75 BQ/M{3} (EQUIVALENT TO 2.02 PCI/L) AVERAGED
 OVER ANY 24 HOUR PERIOD, 50 BQ/M{3} (EQUIVALENT TO 1.37 PCI/L)  AVERAGED
 OVER ANY SEVEN DAY PERIOD.
  2.  GAS  CORPORATIONS  ARE  PROHIBITED FROM BUILDING NEW OR ADDITIONAL
 STORAGE FACILITIES TO MITIGATE RADON LEVELS.
  3. IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY GAS CORPORATION TO PASS HARMFUL  EFFECTS  OF
 MITIGATION TO OTHER REGIONS IN THE STATE.
  4.  NO  GAS  CORPORATION  SHALL DISTRIBUTE GAS UNLESS IT IS REASONABLY
 CERTAIN THAT THE LEVEL OF RADON AND ITS RADIOACTIVE PROGENY IN  THE  GAS
 WHEN  IT  IS  RECEIVED  BY  RESIDENTIAL OR OTHER CONSUMERS WILL BE AT OR
 BELOW THE LEVEL OF 100 BQ/M{3} (EQUIVALENT TO 2.7 PCI/L)  AVERAGED  OVER
 ANY ONE HOUR PERIOD.
