 AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to permitting early voting
  at any polling place within the same county
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  The election law is amended by adding a new section 8-107
 to read as follows:
  § 8-107. CHOICE OF POLLING PLACE. ANY VOTER REGISTERED TO VOTE IN  ANY
 ELECTION  DISTRICT WITHIN A COUNTY OUTSIDE THE CITY OF NEW YORK SHALL BE
 ENTITLED TO VOTE AT ANY POLLING PLACE  WITHIN  THAT  COUNTY.  ANY  VOTER
 REGISTERED  TO VOTE IN ANY ELECTION DISTRICT WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO VOTE AT ANY POLLING PLACE WITHIN THE  CITY  OF  NEW
 YORK. EACH BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL ENSURE THAT EACH POLLING PLACE WITH-
 IN  ITS JURISDICTION SHALL BE EQUIPPED TO PRINT BALLOTS ON DEMAND.  EACH
 ELECTION DISTRICT SHALL HAVE A POLLING PLACE AT WHICH PREPRINTED BALLOTS
 SHALL BE AVAILABLE. THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL PROMULGATE  REGU-
 LATIONS  TO ENSURE THAT AUDITING OF VOTES SHALL REMAIN SIMPLE, ACCURATE,
 AFFORDABLE, AND SECURE, INCLUDING  BY  REQUIRING  MARKS  ON  BALLOTS  TO
 DETERMINE  THE  RELEVANT ELECTION DISTRICT SO BALLOTS CAN BE QUICKLY AND
 EASILY SORTED BY ELECTION DISTRICT. NOTHING IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE
 READ  TO  PERMIT  A  BOARD  OF ELECTIONS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POLLING
 PLACES BELOW EXISTING REQUIREMENTS.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 8-600 of the election law, as  added  by
 chapter 6 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  Any  voter  REGISTERED IN AN ELECTION DISTRICT OUTSIDE THE CITY OF
 NEW YORK may vote at any polling  place  for  early  voting  established
 pursuant  to  subdivision  two  of this section in the county where such
 voter is registered to vote[; provided, however, if it is impractical to
 provide each polling place for early voting all of the election district
 ballots or if early voting at any such polling place makes ensuring that
 no voter has not previously voted early during such election, the  board
 of  elections may assign election districts to a particular early voting
 poll site]. ANY VOTER REGISTERED IN AN ELECTION DISTRICT WITHIN THE CITY

 OF NEW YORK MAY VOTE AT ANY POLLING PLACE FOR EARLY  VOTING  ESTABLISHED
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK. All
 voters  in  each  county  shall have one or more polling places at which
 they  are  eligible  to  vote  throughout  the  early voting period on a
 substantially equal basis. [If the board of elections does not agree  by
 majority  vote to plan to assign election districts to early voting poll
 sites, all voters in the county must be able to vote at  any  poll  site
 for early voting in the county.]
  § 3. Subdivision 9 of section 5-210 of the election law, as amended by
 chapter 44 of the laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  9. The county board of elections shall, promptly and in any event, not
 later than twenty-one days after receipt by it of the application, veri-
 fy the identity of the applicant. In order to do so, the county board of
 elections  shall utilize the information provided in the application and
 shall attempt to verify such information with the  information  provided
 by  the department of motor vehicles, social security administration and
 any other lawful available information source. If the  county  board  of
 elections is unable to verify the identity of the applicant within twen-
 ty-one days of the receipt of the application, it shall immediately take
 steps  to  confirm  that  the  information provided by the applicant was
 accurately utilized by such county board of  elections,  was  accurately
 verified with other information sources and that no data entry error, or
 other  similar  type  of  error,  occurred.  Following completion of the
 preceding steps, the county board of elections shall mail (a)  a  notice
 of  its  approval,  (b) a notice of its approval which includes an indi-
 cation that such board has not yet been able to verify the  identity  of
 the  applicant and a request for more information so that such verifica-
 tion may be completed, or (c) a notice of its rejection of the  applica-
 tion  to  the  applicant  in  a  form  approved  by  the  state board of
 elections. Notices of approval, notices of approval  with  requests  for
 more information or notices of rejection shall be sent by nonforwardable
 first  class or return postage guaranteed mail on which is endorsed such
 language designated by the state board of  elections  to  ensure  postal
 authorities  do  not  forward  such  mail  but return it to the board of
 elections with forwarding information, when it cannot  be  delivered  as
 addressed  and  which contains a request that any such mail received for
 persons not residing at the address be dropped back  in  the  mail.  The
 voter's  registration  and  enrollment shall be complete upon receipt of
 the application by the appropriate county board of elections. The  fail-
 ure  of  a  county  board of elections to verify an applicant's identity
 shall not be the basis for  the  rejection  of  a  voter's  application,
 provided, however, that such verification failure shall be the basis for
 requiring  county board of elections to take the additional verification
 steps provided by this chapter. The notice shall also advise the  regis-
 trant  of the date when his registration and enrollment is effective, of
 the date and the hours of the next regularly scheduled primary or gener-
 al election in which he will be eligible to vote, of the location of the
 polling [place] PLACES of the election district AND COUNTY in  which  he
 is  or will be a qualified voter, whether such polling [place is] PLACES
 ARE accessible to physically  handicapped  voters,  an  indication  that
 physically  handicapped  voters or voters who are ill or voters who will
 be out of the city or county on  the  day  of  the  primary  or  general
 election, may obtain an absentee ballot and the phone number to call for
 absentee  ballot applications, the phone numbers to call for location of
 polling places, to obtain registration forms and  the  phone  number  to
 call  to  indicate that the voter is willing to serve on election day as

 an inspector, poll clerk or interpreter. The notice of approval,  notice
 of  approval  with  request  for more information or notice of rejection
 shall also advise the applicant to notify  the  board  of  elections  if
 there  is  any  inaccuracy.  The form of such mail notification shall be
 prescribed by the state board of elections and shall contain such  other
 information  and  instructions as it may reasonably require to carry out
 the purposes of this section. The request  for  more  information  shall
 inform the voter that "THE FAILURE TO CONTACT THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS AND
 CORRECT  ANY  INACCURACIES IN THE APPLICATION OR PROVIDE REQUESTED ADDI-
 TIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT IN A REQUEST  FOR  IDENTIFICATION  AT  THE
 POLLS  IN  ORDER  TO CAST A VOTE ON A VOTING MACHINE." If such notice is
 returned undelivered without a new address, the  board  shall  forthwith
 send  such applicant a confirmation notice pursuant to the provisions of
 section 5-712 of this article  and  place  such  applicant  in  inactive
 status.  The  state  board of elections shall prepare uniform notices by
 this section as provided for in subdivision eight of  section  3-102  of
 this chapter.
  §  4. Subdivision 1 of section 5-226 of the election law is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. If any voter has been registered in a wrong election district,  the
 board  of  elections  shall,  if he is a qualified voter in any election
 district within the jurisdiction of such board, change his  registration
 to the correct election district. The board of elections shall thereupon
 give  immediate  notice  by mail to such voter that his registration has
 been corrected, and also the location of the polling [place]  PLACES  of
 the election district in which he is a qualified voter.
  § 5. Subdivision 1 of section 5-500 of the election law, as amended by
 chapter 373 of the laws of 1978, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  There  shall  be  two  records  of the registration of each voter.
 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, one record shall be  sent,
 at  the  time of every election, to the polling [place] PLACES where the
 voter is entitled to vote, and shall be known as the "registration  poll
 record".  Between  elections  it  shall  be kept in the main office or a
 branch office of the board of elections. The other record shall be  kept
 constantly  in  such  main office or branch office and shall be known as
 the "central file registration record". The two types of  records  shall
 be prepared in different colors.
  § 6. Subdivision 1 of section 5-601 of the election law, as amended by
 chapter 599 of the laws of 1991, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  [A  physically  disabled voter whose polling place is located in a
 building that is not accessible shall be entitled to vote in  any  other
 election  district whose polling place is located in a building which is
 accessible, provided that the candidates and  ballot  proposals  on  the
 ballot  in  such  other  election  district are the same as those on the
 ballot in the election district in which such voter resides.] EACH POLL-
 ING PLACE SHALL BE ACCESSIBLE.
  § 7. Subdivision 3 of section 8-100 of the election law is amended  to
 read as follows:
