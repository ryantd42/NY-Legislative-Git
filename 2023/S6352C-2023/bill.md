 act of nineteen seventy-four, as amended by chapter 102 of the  laws  of

  (5) as an alternative to the hardship application provided under para-
 graph four of this subdivision, owners of buildings acquired by the same
 owner or a related entity owned by the same principals three years prior
 to  the  date  of application may apply to the division for increases in
 excess of the level of applicable guideline increases established  under
 this  law  based  on  a  finding by the commissioner that such guideline
 increases are not sufficient to enable the owner to maintain  an  annual
 gross  rent  income for such building which exceeds the annual operating
 S. 6352--C  5
 
 expenses of such building by a sum equal to at  least  five  percent  of
 such  gross rent. For the purposes of this paragraph, operating expenses
 shall consist of the actual, reasonable, costs of  fuel,  labor,  utili-
 ties,  taxes,  other  than  income  or  corporate franchise taxes, fees,
 permits, necessary contracted services and non-capital  repairs,  insur-
 ance, parts and supplies, management fees and other administrative costs
 and  mortgage  interest.  For  the  purposes of this paragraph, mortgage
 interest shall be deemed to  mean  interest  on  a  bona  fide  mortgage
 including  an allocable portion of charges related thereto.  Criteria to
 be considered in determining a bona fide mortgage other than an institu-
 tional mortgage shall include; condition of the  property,  location  of
 the  property,  the existing mortgage market at the time the mortgage is
 placed, the term of the mortgage, the amortization rate,  the  principal
 amount  of  the mortgage, security and other terms and conditions of the
 mortgage. The commissioner shall set a rental value for any  unit  occu-
 pied  by the owner or a person related to the owner or unoccupied at the
 owner's choice for more than one month at the last regulated  rent  plus
 the minimum number of guidelines increases or, if no such regulated rent
 existed  or  is  known,  the commissioner shall impute a rent consistent
 with other rents in the building. The amount of hardship increase  shall
 be  such  as may be required to maintain the annual gross rent income as
 provided by this paragraph. The division  shall  not  grant  a  hardship
 application  under  this paragraph or paragraph four of this subdivision
 for a period of three years subsequent to granting a  hardship  applica-
 tion  under  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph. The collection of any
 increase in the rent for any  housing  accommodation  pursuant  to  this
 paragraph  shall  not  exceed six percent in any year from the effective
 date of the order granting the increase over the rent set forth  in  the
 schedule  of gross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above
 said sum to be spread forward in similar increments  and  added  to  the
 rent  as  established  or  set  in future years. No application shall be
 approved unless the owner's equity in such building exceeds five percent
 of: (i) the arms length purchase price of the property; (ii) the cost of
 any capital improvements  for  which  the  owner  has  not  collected  a
 surcharge; (iii) any repayment of principal of any mortgage or loan used
 to  finance the purchase of the property or any capital improvements for
 which the owner has not collected a surcharge; and (iv) any increase  in
 the  equalized  assessed value of the property which occurred subsequent
 to the first valuation of the property after purchase by the owner.  For
 the purposes of this paragraph, owner's equity shall mean the sum of (i)
 the purchase price of the property less the principal of any mortgage or
 loan  used to finance the purchase of the property, (ii) the cost of any
 capital improvement for which the owner has not  collected  a  surcharge
 less the principal of any mortgage or loan used to finance said improve-
 ment,  (iii) any repayment of the principal of any mortgage or loan used
 to finance the purchase of the property or any capital  improvement  for
 which  the owner has not collected a surcharge, and (iv) any increase in
 the equalized assessed value of the property which  occurred  subsequent
 to  the  first valuation of the property after purchase by the owner[.];
