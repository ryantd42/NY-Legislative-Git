 Introduced  by  Sen.  BAILEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing a  sweat-
  free  code of conduct for apparel licensed by the colleges and univer-
  sities of the state  university;  and  to  amend  the  labor  law,  in
  relation to the special task force for the apparel industry
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "ethical business conduct in higher education act".
  §  2.  Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that the state
 university of New York has not responded to decades  old  requests  that
 its  campuses  disaffiliate their business relationships with sweatshops
 in the production and licensing of campus apparel. It is now clear  that
 voluntary action by each campus is no longer an option and that the time
 has come to require a system-wide set of rules and regulations be put in
 place by the chancellor and board of trustees of the state university of
 New York.
  For years, lawmakers, religious and labor groups have criticized state
 university  campus'  affiliations  with  apparel  manufacturers  who are
 indifferent to the fact that  workers  making  university  apparel  face
 abusive  treatment,  excessive  working  hours, dangerous conditions and
 wages that are inadequate to meet basic needs.
  There continues to be  a  strong  demand  that  all  state  university
 campuses  diligently  adopt  sweat-free  standards  in  the  purchase of
 athletic apparel and in the licensing of campus  merchandise.  Advocates
 on  behalf  of working people deplore the repression and exploitation of
 apparel workers in Latin America and elsewhere in the world. The univer-
 sities and colleges of the state  university of New York  should  be  a
 model  for  ethical  business  conduct,  both for their students and the
 broader public. It is past time for the state university system adminis-

 tration and all its campuses to affiliate with the sweat-free and worker
 rights work of the Worker Rights Consortium and the Designated  Supplier
 Program  and  end their business relationships that are de facto support
 for sweatshop conditions.
  Presently  60  of the 64 state university campuses have failed to take
 the example or lead of the universities at  Albany  and  Buffalo,  which
 have  adopted  the  Designated Supplier Program, and the colleges at New
 Paltz and Cortland, all four of which have affiliated  with  the  Worker
 Rights Consortium to ensure sweat-free manufacturing.
  It  is obvious that where there has been strong leadership and commit-
 ment to protecting worker rights this issue has been resolved.  However,
 we cannot wait indefinitely for the  other  60  campuses  to  engage  in
 ethical  business  behavior  that  demonstrates our national respect for
 human rights, worker rights and anti-child labor rights.
  It is well understood by organized labor, religious organizations  and
 social  justice  groups  that  the apparel industry continues to operate
 under a paradigm of cost-cutting without respect to  human  consequence,
 the tragic results of which are the sweatshop conditions that plague the
 supply  chains  of  university  licensed  apparel.  All state university
 campuses that have not already done so must adopt  sweat-free  codes  of
 conduct to which apparel manufacturers producing university apparel must
 adhere.
  It  is the finding of the legislature that in order to comprehensively
 remedy this situation it must be  required  that  the  state  university
 administration  put  in  place strict policies for all its campuses with
 regard to how their apparel is manufactured.  It  is  unacceptable  that
 after  all  the years of calls to end such practices, campus administra-
 tors continue to ignore the violations of human rights that  take  place
 in order for their campus apparel to be manufactured and sold.
  §  3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 362 to read
 as follows:
  § 362. SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT.  1. THE CHANCELLOR  OF  THE  STATE
 UNIVERSITY  SHALL, ON OR BEFORE JANUARY THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWEN-
 TY-FOUR, DEVELOP AND DRAFT A SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE PURCHASE
 AND LICENSING OF APPAREL BY STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTIONS. SUCH  CODE,  TO
 THE  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE,  SHALL MEET OR EXCEED THE LABOR STANDARDS, AND
 BUSINESS AND FACTORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ENUMERATED IN WORKER RIGHTS
 CONSORTIUM'S MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT. THE CODE SHALL REQUIRE  EACH  STATE-
 OPERATED  INSTITUTION TO AFFILIATE WITH THE WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTIUM AND
 PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGNATED SUPPLIER PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFEC-
 TIVELY ENFORCING THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH CODE.  FURTHERMORE, THE  SWEAT-
 FREE  CODE OF CONDUCT SHALL PROVIDE THAT EVERY CONTRACT BETWEEN A STATE-
 OPERATED INSTITUTION  AND  ANY  APPAREL  MANUFACTURER  SHALL  INCLUDE  A
 PROVISION  PROVIDING  FOR  THE  TERMINATION  AND  NULLIFICATION  OF SUCH
 CONTRACT UPON ANY FINDING OF A  VIOLATION  OF  THE  SWEAT-FREE  CODE  OF
 CONDUCT  IN FACILITIES THAT SUCH MANUFACTURER OPERATES OR FROM WHOM SUCH
 MANUFACTURER PURCHASES PRODUCTS.  SUCH CODE OF  CONDUCT  SHALL  PROVIDE
 THAT  NOTICE  OF ANY SUCH VIOLATION MAY BE PROVIDED BY THE WORKER RIGHTS
 CONSORTIUM. THE SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT SHALL PROVIDE FOR  A  REMEDI-
 ATION  PROCESS WHEREBY ANY SUCH MANUFACTURER MAY BE GRANTED THE OPPORTU-
 NITY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION PRIOR TO CONTRACT TERMINATION. SUCH REME-
 DIATION PROCESS, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, SHALL  REFLECT  THE  PROCESS
 DESCRIBED IN THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT OF THE WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTIUM.
  2. SUCH CHANCELLOR SHALL, ON OR BEFORE JANUARY THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOU-
 SAND  TWENTY-FOUR,  SUBMIT  TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES THE CODE OF

 CODE OF CONDUCT, AND WHEN ANY PURCHASING AND LICENSING  AGREEMENTS  WITH
 APPAREL MANUFACTURERS WHICH HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 SUCH  CODE  OF  CONDUCT,  WILL  EXPIRE.  SUCH PRELIMINARY REPORT SHALL

 CODE  OF  CONDUCT,  A  LIST  OF EACH STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTION THAT HAS

 DESIGNATED  SUPPLIER  PROGRAM,  AND  WHEN  ANY  PURCHASING AND LICENSING
 AGREEMENTS WITH APPAREL MANUFACTURERS WHICH HAVE FAILED TO  COMPLY  WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH CODE OF CONDUCT, WILL EXPIRE.
  5.  THE  CHIEF  EXECUTIVE  OFFICER  OF EACH STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTION
 WHICH HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE CODE OF CONDUCT  OR  AFFILIATE  WITH
 THE  WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTIUM AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGNATED SUPPLIER
 PROGRAM ON OR  BEFORE  MARCH  FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  SHALL

  § 4. The opening paragraph of section 342 of the labor law, as amended
 by chapter 41 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
