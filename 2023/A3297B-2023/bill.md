 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  PIROZZOLO  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Local Governments
 
 AN ACT to amend to the general municipal law, in relation to prohibiting
  the siting of battery energy storage system sites on Staten Island
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. It is the intent of this Legislature to
 protect New York State from the adverse effects of the siting of battery
 energy storage systems and related facilities and infrastructure in most
 instances,  including  but  not limited to air pollution and the risk of
 explosions. The cumulative impact of spewing toxic fumes  into  the  air
 and  the  potential  for  explosions  in  such close proximity to homes,
 schools,  churches,  playgrounds,  and  small  businesses  would  prompt
 extremely  negative effects on the public health and safety of the local
 community.
  The Legislature hereby determines that the public interest requires  a
 prohibition  on the siting of battery energy storage systems and related
 facilities and infrastructure on Staten Island, in most instances.
  § 2. The general municipal law is amended by adding a new section  137
 to read as follows:
  §  137.  BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS; PROHIBITION ON STATEN ISLAND.

 NOT TO INCLUDE A STAND-ALONE TWELVE-VOLT  CAR  BATTERY  OR  AN  ELECTRIC
 MOTOR  VEHICLE. A BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM SHALL BE CLASSIFIED AS A
 TIER ONE OR TIER TWO BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM AS FOLLOWS: (A)  TIER
 ONE  BATTERY  ENERGY  STORAGE  SYSTEMS SHALL POSSESS AN AGGREGATE ENERGY
 CAPACITY LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO SIX HUNDRED KILOWATT HOURS AND, IF  IN  A
 ROOM  OR  ENCLOSED  AREA, CONSIST OF ONLY A SINGLE ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM
 TECHNOLOGY; (B) TIER TWO BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS SHALL POSSESS AN

 THE FUTURE SITING AND CONSTRUCTION OF BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS AND
 RELATED  FACILITIES,  SYSTEMS,  INFRASTRUCTURE,  AND  SUBSTATIONS OF ANY
 SCALE AND POSSESSING ANY STORAGE CAPACITY AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO, THOSE DEPLOYING  LITHIUM-ION  BATTERIES,  IS  HEREBY  PROHIBITED  ON
 STATEN  ISLAND.  NO  PERMIT  SHALL  BE  ISSUED  FOR  THE  APPROVAL  OR
 CONSTRUCTION THEREOF, INCLUDING THOSE RESERVED FOR UTILITY OR COMMERCIAL
 USE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE SITED  FOR  USE  IN  INDUSTRIAL  ZONES,
 ALONG WITH THOSE RESERVED FOR SMALL-SCALE RESIDENTIAL APPLICATIONS.
  §  3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to siting
 permit applications pending as of such effective date.
