  Section 1. 1. The department of financial services is  hereby  author-

  2. Such study shall include, but shall not be limited to:
  (a)  collecting data on how many people are currently uninsured in New
 York state and the reasons for their being uninsured including, but  not
 limited  to, those eligible for public assistance programs, those ineli-
 gible to purchase insurance because of  their  immigration  status,  and
 those who choose to go uninsured because of financial reasons; and
  (b)  the feasibility of creating programs, subsidies, and/or tax cred-
 its to help expand health insurance coverage in New York state to  unin-
 sured  individuals  including,  but not limited to, the costs and effec-
 tiveness  of  instituting  such  new  programs,  subsidies,  and/or  tax
 credits.  Such  new  programs shall include but shall not be limited to:
 (i) an individual state-level insurance mandate; (ii)  a  state  supple-
 mental  premium tax credit to supplement the current federal tax credit;
 and (iii) a state premium tax credit for those not  eligible  to  access
 the federal tax credit because of their immigration status or income.
  3. No later than eighteen months after the effective date of this act,
 the department of financial services shall report to the legislature and
 the  governor on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to section
 one of this act and any legislative recommendations deemed to be  neces-
 sary.
