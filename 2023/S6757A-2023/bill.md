 AN  ACT  to  amend the labor law, in relation to extending the authority
  and oversight of wage boards to include benefits  and  working  condi-
  tions and changes the reference to such boards as workers' boards
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent.  The legislature  finds  and  declares
 that:
  1. For significant periods in our history, employers have demonstrated
 that  they  can  partner with employees to ensure the provision of wages
 and conditions employees need to  succeed  in  their  work  and  achieve
 economic security.
  2.  In  1960,  the state adopted a minimum wage, which has served as a
 wage floor that has substantially increased well-being for many  workers
 throughout the state.
  3.  Since  its  initial  adoption,  the economy and the workforce have
 shifted and evolved in ways that require augmenting the minimum wage act
 to ensure that workers can provide for themselves and their families.
  4. Many employers have adapted to their employees' changing needs  and
 the  shifts  in the economy to provide more robust work-related benefits
 and more productive working conditions, thus  enhancing  their  workers'
 overall well-being.
  5.  However,  because  existing law does not fully reflect these needs
 and the changes in the economy and workers' lives, many  employers  find
 themselves at a competitive disadvantage when they provide such benefits
 and  working  conditions  for  their workers, and workers who are not as

 fortunate must overcome greater struggles to succeed and thrive in their
 careers and in their private lives.
  6.  The state's laws must adapt to changes in the economy and needs of
 workers, and New York's establishment of the  minimum  wage  provides  a
 framework  for  setting  additional  minimum  standards for benefits and
 working conditions that can reflect changes in the needs of workers.
  7. Extending the authority of wage boards under the minimum  wage  act
 to consider additional minimum standards for benefits and working condi-
 tions  will  lead to higher levels of financial stability, health, well-
 being, and satisfaction for workers, reduce the state's expenditures  on
 public benefits, and will create opportunities for employers and workers
 to  collaborate  to develop mutually beneficial strategies for workplace
 improvements and career pathways.
  § 2. Section 650 of the labor law, as amended by chapter  439  of  the
 laws of 1962, is amended to read as follows:
  §  650.  Statement  of public policy.  There are persons employed [in
 some occupations] in the state of New York at wages, WITH  BENEFITS  AND
 UNDER  WORKING  CONDITIONS insufficient to [provide adequate maintenance
 for] SUSTAIN themselves and their families. Such CONDITIONS  OF  employ-
 ment  [impairs]  IMPAIR the health, [efficiency] FINANCIAL SECURITY, and
 well-being of the persons so employed, [constitutes]  CONSTITUTE  unfair
 competition  against  other  employers  and their employees, [threatens]
 THREATEN the stability of  industry,  [reduces]  REDUCE  the  purchasing
 power  of  employees,  [and  requires]  REQUIRE, in many instances, that
 wages AND BENEFITS be supplemented by the payment of public  moneys  for
 relief  or other public and private assistance, AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL
 BURDENS ON THE STATE AND ITS PEOPLE TO  SUPPORT  THOSE  WITH  INADEQUATE
 BENEFITS  AND  TO  COMBAT THE ILLS CAUSED BY UNACCEPTABLE WORKING CONDI-
 TIONS. Employment of persons at [these] insufficient rates of pay,  WITH
 INSUFFICIENT  BENEFITS AND UNDER UNACCEPTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS threat-
 ens the health, SAFETY and well-being of the people of  this  state  and
 injures the overall economy.
  Accordingly,  it  is the declared policy of the state of New York that
 such  conditions  be  eliminated  as  rapidly  as  practicable  [without
 substantially curtailing opportunities for employment or earning power].
 To  this  end, minimum wage, MINIMUM BENEFITS AND MINIMUM WORKING CONDI-
 TION standards shall be established and maintained.
  § 3. Subdivision 3 of section 651 of the labor law, as added by  chap-
 ter  619  of the laws of 1960, is amended and three new subdivisions 10,

 ING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, PAID FAMILY LEAVE, SICK

 RITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED, THEIR CASH EQUIVALENT.
  11. "WORKING CONDITIONS" MEANS  ESTABLISHMENT  OF  WORKING  HOURS  AND
 PROTECTION OF THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF WORKERS, AND PROMOTION OF EMPLOY-
 EES' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS AFFECTING THEIR WORK.

 AGENT THEREOF;
 S. 6757--A  3

 two of this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,  except  [(1)  as  expressly  otherwise
 provided  in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, and (2)] where the board
 finds conditions of employment are  such  as  to  make  an  hourly  rate
 impracticable,  in which event the board may recommend a wage rate other

 sioner at such weekly wage as shall be prescribed in such regulation.]
  § 8. Section 656 of the labor law, as added by chapter 619 of the laws
 of 1960, is amended to read as follows:
  § 656. Action by commissioner upon [wage] WORKERS' board report.  When
 the  [wage] WORKERS' board submits its report and recommendations to the
 commissioner, the commissioner shall forthwith file them with the secre-
 tary of the department. Within five days of their receipt,  the  commis-
 sioner  shall publish a notice of such filing in at least ten newspapers
 of general circulation in the state. Any objections to  the  report  and
 recommendations shall be filed with the commissioner within fifteen days
 after  such  publication. The commissioner may, if [he] THE COMMISSIONER
 deems it appropriate, order oral  argument,  which  shall  be  scheduled
 before the commissioner, or such representative as [he] THE COMMISSIONER
 may  designate,  on  five  days'  notice  to  the persons who have filed
 objections to the report and recommendations. Whether or not oral  argu-
 ment  is scheduled, the commissioner shall by order accept or reject the
 board's report and recommendations within forty-five days  after  filing
 with the secretary of the department, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMISSIONER MAY
 ONLY  REJECT  THE BOARD'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS IF THE COMMISSIONER
 FINDS NO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  TO  SUPPORT  SUCH  RECOMMENDATIONS.  [The
 commissioner may by such order] IN INDUSTRIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT DETER-
 MINES  RELY  PREDOMINANTLY  ON THE APPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS, IF THE
 COST OF SUCH RECOMMENDATION EXCEEDS EXISTING APPROPRIATIONS, THE COMMIS-
 SIONER MAY MAKE ACCEPTANCE OF A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION CONTINGENT  UPON
 A  SUBSEQUENT APPROPRIATION OR modify the regulations recommended by the
 board, PROVIDED THAT SUCH MODIFICATIONS DO NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUC-
 ING THE MINIMUM WAGE, MINIMUM BENEFITS AND  MINIMUM  WORKING  CONDITIONS
 REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING RULES OR REGULATIONS.  IF A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDA-
 TION IS REJECTED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT APPROPRIATIONS, THE COMMISSION-
 ER  SHALL  CONSULT  WITH  THE  COMMISSIONER  OR DIRECTOR OF THE RELEVANT
 S. 6757--A  8
 
 DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY TO REQUEST SUCH APPROPRIATION. Such  order  of  the
 commissioner  shall  become  effective thirty days after publication, in
 the manner prescribed in this section, of a notice of  such  order.  The
 commissioner  may,  within  such  forty-five  days, confer with the wage
 board, which may make such changes in its report or  recommendations  as
 it  may  deem  fit.  [The commissioner also may, within such forty-five
 days, remand the matter to the board for such further proceeding  as  he
 may direct.] THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL IN NO WAY RESTRICT ANY
 COUNTY  OR  MUNICIPALITY FROM ENACTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS WHICH PROVIDE
 FOR MINIMUM WAGES, MINIMUM BENEFITS, OR MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH
 ARE MORE FAVORABLE THAN THOSE PROVIDED PURSUANT TO ANY  ORDER  OR  REGU-
 LATION ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER THIS ARTICLE, NOR SHALL ANY SUCH
 ENACTED LAWS OR REGULATIONS BE PREEMPTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTI-
 CLE.
  § 9. The labor law is amended by adding a new section 656-a to read as
 follows:
  §  656-A.  MODIFICATIONS  WITHOUT WORKERS' BOARD DETERMINATIONS. IF AN
 ESTABLISHED WORKERS' BOARD  FAILS  TO  MAKE  DETERMINATIONS  UNDER  THIS
 SECTION  WITHIN  ANY THREE-YEAR PERIOD AS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH
 (B) OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION SIX HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE OF THIS  ARTI-
 CLE,  THE MINIMUM WAGES AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, MINIMUM BENEFITS,
 FOR THE OCCUPATION OR OCCUPATIONS IN QUESTION SHALL BE  INCREASED  IN  A
 MANNER  WHICH  CORRESPONDS  TO THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR THE MOST RECENT
 TWELVE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDING JUNE OF THAT  YEAR  BASED  ON  THE  CONSUMER
 PRICE  INDEX  FOR  ALL URBAN CONSUMERS  ON  A  NATIONAL AND SEASONALLY
 UNADJUSTED BASIS, OR A SUCCESSOR  INDEX  AS  CALCULATED  BY  THE  UNITED
 STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF  LABOR.  SUCH INCREASE SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON THE
 DATE WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE END OF SUCH THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND SHALL
 ACCOUNT FOR AGGREGATE INFLATION OVER THE FOUR YEARS PRIOR TO SUCH DATE.
  § 10. Section 657 of the labor law, as added by  chapter  619  of  the
 laws  of  1960,  subdivision  2 as amended by chapter 102 of the laws of
 1968 and subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 310 of the laws of 1962, is
 amended to read as follows:
  § 657. Appeals from [wage] orders and regulations.  1. Finality.  Any
 minimum  wage,  MINIMUM BENEFITS OR MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS order and
 regulation issued by the commissioner pursuant to  this  article  shall,
 unless appealed from as provided in this section, be final. The findings
 of  the  commissioner  as to the facts shall be conclusive on any appeal
 from an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to [sections]  SECTION
 six  hundred fifty-two, six hundred fifty-six, or six hundred fifty-nine
 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2. Review by board of standards and appeals. Any person  in  interest,
 including  a  labor  organization,  ELIGIBLE  REPRESENTATIVE or employer
 association, in any occupation for which a minimum wage,  MINIMUM  BENE-
 FITS  OR  MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS order or regulation has been issued
 under the provisions of this article who is aggrieved by such  order  or
 regulation  may  obtain review before the board of standards and appeals
 by filing with said board, within forty-five days after the date of  the
 publication  of  the notice of such order or regulation, a written peti-
 tion requesting that the order or regulation be modified or set aside. A
 copy of such petition shall be served promptly upon the commissioner AND
 THE WORKERS' BOARD ISSUING THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM WHICH THE
 APPLICABLE ORDER OR REGULATION AROSE. On such appeal,  the  commissioner
 shall  certify  and file with the board of standards and appeals a tran-
 script of the entire record, including the testimony and  evidence  upon
 which  such  order  or  regulation was made and the report of the [wage]
 S. 6757--A  9
 
 WORKERS' board. The board of standards  and  appeals,  upon  the  record
 certified  and  filed  by  the commissioner, shall, after oral argument,
 determine whether the order or regulation appealed from is  contrary  to
 law.  Within  forty-five  days  after the expiration of the time for the
 filing of a petition, the board of standards and appeals shall issue  an
 order  confirming,  amending  or  setting  aside the order or regulation
 appealed from. The appellate jurisdiction of the board of standards  and
 appeals  shall  be  exclusive  and  its order final except that the same

 of the supreme court, third judicial department, within sixty days after
 its  order is issued. The commissioner AND THE WORKERS' BOARD shall EACH
 be considered an aggrieved party entitled to  take  an  appeal  from  an
 order of the board of standards and appeals.
  3.  Security.  The  taking of an appeal by an employer to the board of
 standards and appeals SHALL IN NO EVENT OPERATE AS A STAY OF  A  MINIMUM
 WORKING  CONDITIONS  ORDER  OR  REGULATION ISSUED UNDER THIS ARTICLE AND
 shall not operate as a stay of a minimum wage OR MINIMUM BENEFITS  order
 or  regulation  issued  under this article unless and until, and only so
 long as, the employer shall have provided  security  determined  by  the
 board  of  standards  and  appeals  in accordance with this section. The
 security shall be sufficient to guarantee to the employees affected  the
 payment  of  the  difference  between the wage AND THE CASH VALUE OF THE
 BENEFITS they receive and the minimum wage AND THE  CASH  VALUE  OF  THE
 MINIMUM  BENEFITS  they  would be entitled to receive under the terms of
 the minimum wage order,  MINIMUM  BENEFITS  ORDER  or  regulation  (such
 [difference]  DIFFERENCES  being  hereinafter  referred to as "underpay-
 ments") in the event that such order or regulation is  affirmed  by  the
 board of standards and appeals. The security shall be either:
  a.  A  bond  filed with the board of standards and appeals issued by a
 fidelity or surety company authorized to do business in this state.  The
 bond shall be sufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at the
 time  the  bond is filed with the board of standards and appeals and the
 amount of underpayments that can reasonably be expected to accrue within
 the following sixty days; or
  b. An escrow account established by the employer  [in]  ON  behalf  of
 employees  and  deposited  in  a bank or trust company in this state, of
 which the employer has notified the board of standards  and  appeals  in
 writing  that  he OR SHE has established such account. The account shall
 be sufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at  the  time  of
 notification  to  the  board  of standards and appeals and shall be kept
 current by the employer depositing therein the amount  of  underpayments
 accruing each and every pay period. Such deposits shall be made no later
 than  the day on which the wages for each pay period are payable.  As an
 alternative thereto, an employer may deposit the amount of underpayments
 due at the time the deposit is made and the amount of underpayments that
 can reasonably be expected to accrue within the following sixty days, as
 determined by the board of standards and  appeals.  The  employer  shall
 keep  accurate  records  showing  the  total amount of each deposit, the
 period covered, and the name and address of each employee and the amount
 deposited to his OR HER account. The employees' escrow account shall  be
 deemed to be a trust fund for the benefit of the employees affected, and
 no bank or trust company shall release funds in such account without the
 written approval of the board of standards and appeals.
  4.  Maintenance  of  security. The commissioner, at the request and on
 behalf of the board of standards and appeals, shall have  the  right  to
 inspect  the  books  and  records  of every employer who appeals from an
 S. 6757--A  10
 
 order or who provides a security in accordance with subdivision  [eight]
 SEVEN  of  this  section.  In  the event that the board of standards and
 appeals finds that the security provided by an employer is  insufficient
 to  cover  the  amount of underpayments, it shall notify the employer to
 increase the amount of the security. If the employer fails  to  increase
 the  security  to  the  amount  requested  within  seven days after such
 notice, the stay shall be terminated. If  the  board  of  standards  and
 appeals  finds  that  the  amount of the security is excessive, it shall
 decrease the amount of security required.
  5.  Review  of  determination  as  to  security.  Notwithstanding  any
 provision  in  this chapter, any determination of the board of standards
 and appeals with reference  to  subdivisions  three  and  four  of  this
 section  shall  be reviewable only by a special proceeding under article
 seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules  instituted  in  the
 supreme  court in the third judicial district within ten days after such
 determination.
  6. Security on court review. In the event that an appeal is taken from
 the order of the board of standards and appeals to the supreme court  in
 the third judicial district pursuant to subdivision two of this section,
 the  court  may continue the security in effect or require such security
 as it deems proper.
  7. [Waiver of security. Notwithstanding any provision in this section,
 the board of standards and appeals may, in  its  discretion,  waive  the
 requirement of a security for an employer who the board of standards and
 appeals  finds  is  of  such  financial  responsibility that payments to
 employees of any underpayments due or to accrue are assured without  the
 security provided by this section.
  8.] Stay for other employers. Any employer affected by a minimum wage,
 MINIMUM  BENEFITS OR MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS order or regulation from
 which an appeal has been taken by another employer to the board of stan-
 dards and appeals  or  to  the  supreme  court  in  the  third  judicial
 district,  may  obtain  [a]  THE  EMPLOYER'S  OWN  RESPECTIVE  stay  of
 proceedings [against him] WITH RESPECT TO MINIMUM WAGES OR MINIMUM BENE-
 FITS by providing a security in accordance with subdivisions  three  and
 four  of  this section within thirty days after the filing of the appeal
 by the other employer.
  § 11. Section 658 of the labor law, as amended by chapter 443  of  the
 laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  §  658.  Appeals from compliance orders. An appeal pursuant to section

 WORKING CONDITIONS order or regulation promulgated thereunder, shall not
 bring under review any minimum wage, MINIMUM BENEFITS OR MINIMUM WORKING
 CONDITIONS order or  regulation  promulgated  under  this  article.  The
 provisions of subdivision two of section six hundred fifty-seven OF THIS

 reconvene the same [wage] WORKERS' board or appoint a new  [wage]  WORK-
 ERS'  board  to recommend whether or not the minimum wage, MINIMUM BENE-
 FITS, MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS  and  regulations  prescribed  by  such
 order  should  be  modified,  and  the provisions of section six hundred
 fifty-five through six hundred fifty-seven OF THIS ARTICLE shall  there-
 after apply.
  2.  By  commissioner. The commissioner, without referral to the [wage]
 WORKERS' board, may, at any time after public hearing, by order  propose
 such  modifications  of  or  additions to any regulations as he may deem
 appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this article. Notice of  hear-
 ing  and promulgation of any such order shall be published in accordance
 with the provisions contained in section six hundred fifty-six  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE.  Such order shall be effective thirty days after such publica-
 tion and section six hundred fifty-seven OF THIS ARTICLE shall thereaft-
 er apply.

 OF REDUCING THE MINIMUM WAGE, REDUCING BENEFITS, MAKING  WORKING  CONDI-
 TIONS  LESS  FAVORABLE  TO  EMPLOYEES, OR AFFECTING THE REGULATIONS IN A
 MANNER THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS EMPLOYEES OF THE APPLICABLE OCCUPATION  OR

 CABLE  MINIMUM  WAGE,  MINIMUM  BENEFITS,  OR MINIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS

 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
