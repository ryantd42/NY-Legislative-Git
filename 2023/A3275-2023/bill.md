  §  4.  Severability.  If any clause, sentence, subdivision, paragraph,
 section or part of this act be adjudged by any court of competent juris-
 diction to be invalid, or if any federal agency  determines  in  writing
 that  this act would render New York state ineligible for the receipt of
 federal funds such judgment or written determination shall  not  affect,

 operation  to  the  clause, sentence, subdivision, paragraph, section or
 part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment
 or written determination shall have been rendered.
  § 5. This act shall take effect two years after it shall have become a
 law; provided, however, that this act shall be deemed  repealed  if  any
 federal agency determines in writing that this act would render New York
 state ineligible for the receipt of federal funds or any court of compe-
 tent jurisdiction finally determines that this act would render New York
 state out of compliance with federal law or regulation. The commissioner
 of  transportation shall notify the legislative bill drafting commission
 upon the occurrence of the provisions of section  two  of  this  act  in
 order  that the commission may maintain an accurate and timely effective
 data base of the official text of the laws of the state of New  York  in
 furtherance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of the legisla-
 tive  law  and  section 70-b of the public officers law. Effective imme-
 diately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation
 necessary for the implementation of this act on its effective  date  are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
