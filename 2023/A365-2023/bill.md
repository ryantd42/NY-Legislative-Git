  Committee on Insurance
 
 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, the public health law and the  social
  services  law,  in relation to requiring coverage for delivery through

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The Legislature here-
 by  finds  that  there is a serious health concern in insurance policies
 denying coverage for contraceptive care. The Legislature also finds that
 throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has  been  essential  for
 patients across the state to receive care safely.
  This  Act  enacts various provisions requiring that insurance policies
 cover services provided  through  telemedicine,  including  requirements
 that  insurers  provide coverage for contraceptive care, that will allow
 patients across the  state  to  receive  care  and  limit  the  risk  of
 infection of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.

 by  section 3 of part V of chapter 57 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a) (1) An insurer shall not exclude from coverage a service  that  is
 otherwise  covered  under  a policy that provides comprehensive coverage

 TECHNOLOGY, as [that term is] SUCH TERMS ARE defined in  subsection  (b)
 of  this  section[;  provided, however, that an insurer may exclude from
 coverage a service by a health care provider where the provider  is  not
 otherwise  covered  under the policy] AND IN SECTION TWENTY-NINE HUNDRED
 NINETY-NINE-CC OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW.  An  insurer  may  subject  the
