 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to requiring  public  and
  private  colleges and universities to provide all incoming and current
  students with information about depression and suicide prevention  and
  resources available to them on campus
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that there is a need to address the growing number of students
 at the collegiate level who are  suffering  from  psychiatric  stressors
 that  may  lead to suicide. The legislature further recognizes that such
 psychiatric stressors also contribute to difficulties  in  learning  and
 success  on  the collegiate level. Early detection and identification of
 at-risk individuals may not only prevent suicide,  but  may  also  allow
 such  other  students  suffering  from  psychiatric stressors to get the
 support needed to be successful in their academic endeavors. The support
 necessary to achieve these goals may often require collaboration between
 college officials and parents and/or guardians in such a manner as to be
 consistent with the needs of each student.
  Therefore, to achieve the above-stated goals, the  legislature  hereby
 finds and declares that every college within the state shall establish a
 suicide prevention program.
  §  2.  The  education law is amended by adding a new section 6438-b to
 read as follows:
  § 6438-B. THE COLLEGIATE SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM. 1.  THE  TRUSTEES
 OR  GOVERNING BOARD OF EACH COLLEGE SHALL INFORM INCOMING STUDENTS ABOUT
 SUICIDE PREVENTION MEASURES THROUGH PROGRAMS  WHICH  MAY  INCLUDE  WORK-
 SHOPS,  SEMINARS, DISCUSSION GROUPS, AND FILM PRESENTATIONS, IN ORDER TO
 DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT PRESSURES AND MATTERS  THAT  MAY  PLACE  A
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
