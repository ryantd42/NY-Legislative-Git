  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit members of the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees'  Retirement  System  (NYSLERS) who are employed by Monroe County in
 the title of deputy sheriff-civil,  as  certified  by  the  sheriff,  to
 retire  upon  completion of twenty-five (25) years of creditable service
 with a benefit of one-half (50%) final average salary,  provided  Monroe
 County  has  filed  a  resolution with the New York State Comptroller to
 provide such benefits on or before December 31, 2024. Additionally,  for
 those  members  covered  under  the  provisions of Article 14, this bill
 would permit an irrevocable election to forfeit the benefits of  Article
 14  in  favor  of  the  25-year  plan benefit, when elected on or before
 December 31, 2024 or within one year of entering  service  as  a  deputy
 sheriff-civil with Monroe County.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $24,000 in the
 annual contributions of Monroe County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $147,000 which  will  be
 borne by Monroe County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on 9 affected members employed by
 Monroe County, with annual salary of approximately $688,000 as of  March
 31,  2022.  The  affected  members  were  identified  using  information
 provided by Andrew Toranzo of the New York State Minority Ways and Means
 Committee.
