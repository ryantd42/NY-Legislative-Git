  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 2023, as Disability Pride Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2023,  as  Disability
Pride  Month  in  the  State of New York, in honor of the passing of the
Americans with Disabilities Act in July of 1990; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed by  Congress
in  1990,  enshrining  the  civil  rights of people with disabilities by
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a disability,  committing  to
greater  accessibility  in  public  spaces  and  requiring  employers to
provide basic reasonable accommodations to ensure equality for  all,  no
matter your ability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Disability  Pride  Month  is  an  opportunity to honor the
heroic activism of disability rights organizers in paving  the  way  for
the  ADA and continuing the fight to ensure greater equity for people of
all abilities,  with  protests  such  as  the  Capital  Crawl  of  1990,
protesting  for  pedestrian  ramps  in  New  York  City  and  many  more
courageous moments of activism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Disability Pride Month is also a time  to  amplify  diverse
stories of New Yorkers with disabilities and their immense contributions
to our state as approximately 1 in 5 New Yorkers has a disability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  Disability  Pride Month we honor the experience of
every person with disabilities and their own unique experience,  whether
they  experience  a  physical, mental, invisible, undiagnosed or sensory
disability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  with  disabilities  still  continue  to  face
discrimination  and  struggle  to  have  equal  access  to  meaningful
employment, education and healthcare; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is still a long way to go in supporting  New  Yorkers
with  disabilities,  from greater awareness to accessibility; Disability
Pride Month represents  a  commitment  to  create  better  accessibility
across  public and virtual spaces for all individuals with disabilities;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative to continue educating the  public  on  the
historical  activism  and the unique stories of people with disabilities
and their incredible contributions to ensuring New York is an accessible
and equitable place for all New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2023, as Disability
Pride Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
