 It  is in the interest of the people of the city of New York and the New

 complaints  concerning  misconduct by officers of the department towards
 members of  the  public  be  complete,  thorough  and  impartial.  These

 inquires  must be conducted fairly and independently, and in a manner in
 which the public and the police department have confidence. An independ-
 ent civilian complaint review board is  hereby  established  as  a  body
 comprised solely of members of the public with the authority to investi-
 gate  AND PROSECUTE allegations of police misconduct as provided in this
 section.
  (b) Civilian complaint review board.
  1. The civilian complaint review board shall consist of 15 members  of
 the public. Members shall be residents of the city of New York and shall
 reflect the diversity of the city's population. The members of the board
 shall  be  appointed  as follows: (i) five members, one from each of the
 five boroughs, shall be appointed by the city council; (ii)  one  member
 shall  be  appointed  by  the  public advocate; (iii) three members with
 experience as law enforcement professionals shall be designated  by  the
 police  commissioner and appointed by the mayor; (iv) five members shall
 be appointed by the mayor; and (v) one member shall be appointed jointly
 by the mayor and the speaker of the council to serve  as  chair  of  the
 board.
  2.  No  member  of  the  board  shall  hold any other public office or
 employment. No members, except those designated by  the  police  commis-
 sioner,  shall  have  experience as law enforcement professionals, or be
 former employees of  the  New  York  city  police  department.  For  the
 purposes  of  this section, experience as a law enforcement professional
 shall include experience as a  police  officer,  criminal  investigator,
 special  agent,  or  a  managerial or supervisory employee who exercised
 substantial policy discretion on law enforcement matters, in a  federal,
 state,  or  local  law  enforcement  agency, other than experience as an
 attorney in a prosecutorial agency.
  3. The members shall be appointed for terms of three years. The public
 advocate shall make the public advocate's first appointment to the board
 on or before May 6, 2020. The board member  so  appointed  shall  assume
 office  on  July 6, 2020. The mayor and the speaker of the council shall
 make their initial joint appointment to the board on or  before  May  6,
 2020. The member so appointed shall serve as the board's chair and shall
 assume office on July 6, 2020.
  4.  Members  of the board shall serve until their successors have been
 appointed and qualified. In the event of a vacancy on the  board  during
 the term of office of a member by reason of removal, death, resignation,
 or  otherwise,  a  successor  shall  be chosen in the same manner as the
 original appointment within 60 days from the date such vacancy occurred.
 A member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve for the balance of  the
 unexpired  term.  During  any period in which the office of the chair is
 vacant, the mayor shall select a member of the board to serve as interim
 chair until such vacancy has been filled.
  (c) Powers and duties of the board.
  1. The board shall have the power to receive, investigate, hear,  make
 findings  and  recommend  action upon complaints FILED by members of the
 public, OR INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE BOARD or complaints initiated  by
 the  board  against members of the police department that allege miscon-
 duct involving excessive use of  force,  abuse  of  authority  including
 bias-based  policing and racial profiling, discourtesy, or use of offen-
 sive language, including, but not limited to, slurs  relating  to  race,
 ethnicity,  religion,  gender,  sexual  orientation  and disability. The
 board shall also have the power to investigate, hear, make findings  and
 recommend  action  regarding  the  truthfulness of any material official
 statement made by a member of the police department who is  the  subject
 S. 2108  3

 of a complaint received or initiated by the board, if such statement was
 made  during  the course of and in relation to the board's resolution of
 such complaint. The findings and recommendations of the board,  and  the
 basis therefor, shall be submitted to the police commissioner, WHO SHALL
 HAVE  NO  DISCRETION  IN  WHETHER  TO IMPOSE THE RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE.
 WHERE THE BOARD SUBSTANTIATES  ONE  OR MORE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A MEMBER
 OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND  RECOMMENDS  A  LEVEL OF  DISCIPLINE  THAT
 WOULD SUBJECT THE MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT  TO  BEING FINED,  REPRIMAND-
 ED,  REMOVED,  SUSPENDED  OR DISMISSED  FROM THE FORCE, THE COMPLAINT
 SHALL BE ADJUDICATED BY A HEARING OFFICER PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION (D) OF
 THIS SECTION.  No finding or recommendation shall be based  solely  upon
 an  unsworn  complaint  or  statement,  nor shall prior unsubstantiated,
 unfounded or withdrawn complaints be the basis for any such  finding  or
 recommendation.
  2.  The  board  shall promulgate rules of procedure in accordance with
 the city administrative procedure act, including  rules  that  prescribe
 the  manner in which investigations AND PROSECUTIONS are to be conducted
 and recommendations made and the manner by which, when a member  of  the
 public  is  the complainant, such member of the public is to be informed
 of the status of his or her complaint. Such rules may  provide  for  the
 establishment  of  panels,  which  shall  consist of not less than three
 members of the board, which shall be empowered to supervise the investi-
 gation of matters within  the  board's  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  this
 section,  and  to  hear,  make  findings  and  recommend  action on such
 matters. No such panel shall consist exclusively of members appointed by
 the council, or designated by the police commissioner, or  appointed  by
 the mayor.
  3.  The board, by majority vote of its members, may compel the attend-
 ance of witnesses and require the production of such records  and  other
 materials  as  are  necessary  for  the investigation AND PROSECUTION of
 matters within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter. The board  may
 request  the  corporation counsel to institute proceedings in a court of
 appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the subpoena power exercised  pursu-
 ant  to this chapter, and the board itself may, subject to chapter 17 of
 the charter, institute such proceedings. The board may, subject  to  any
 conditions  it deems appropriate, delegate to and revoke from its execu-
 tive  director  such  subpoena  authority  and  authority  to  institute
 proceedings.
  4.  The  board shall establish a mediation program pursuant to which a
 complainant may voluntarily choose to resolve a complaint  by  means  of
 informal conciliation.
  5.  The board is authorized, within appropriations available therefor,
 to appoint such employees as  are  necessary  to  exercise  its  powers,
 including but not limited to the power to initiate complaints in accord-
 ance  with paragraph 1 of this subdivision, and fulfill its duties.  The
 board shall employ civilian investigators  to  investigate  all  matters
 within its jurisdiction. THE BOARD SHALL CREATE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROSE-
 CUTION  UNIT, STAFFED BY ATTORNEYS AND THE NECESSARY SUPPORT STAFF, THAT
 SHALL HANDLE THE PROSECUTION OF SUBSTANTIATED  CASES  BEFORE  A  HEARING
 OFFICER.
  6.  The board shall issue to the mayor and the city council a semi-an-
 nual report which  shall  describe  its  activities  and  summarize  its
 actions.  Such  report  shall  include, for each investigation initiated
 pursuant to  section  441,  such  investigation's  date  of  initiation,
 current  status and any date of completion or termination, a description
 of any investigative findings and recommendations set forth in a written
 S. 2108  4
 
 statement of final  determination  and  a  description  of  any  written
 reports  from the police commissioner in response to a written statement
 of final determination.
  7.  The  board  shall  have the responsibility of informing the public
 about the board and its duties, and  shall  develop  and  administer  an
 on-going  program  for  the  education  of  the  public  regarding  the
 provisions of this chapter.
  (d) HEARINGS.
  1. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHALL APPOINT AT LEAST ONE HEARING  OFFICER,
 WHO  SHALL  BE A CIVILIAN WITH NO LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND, TO PRESIDE
 OVER AND ADJUDICATE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS  AND  MAKE  FINAL  DETERMI-
 NATIONS  IN  CASES WHERE THE BOARD HAS SUBSTANTIATED ONE OR MORE ALLEGA-
 TIONS AGAINST A POLICE OFFICER AND  RECOMMENDED  COMMAND  DISCIPLINE  OR
 CHARGES AND SPECIFICATIONS.
  2.  THE  HEARING OFFICER, UPON APPROVAL OF THE BOARD CHAIR, SHALL HAVE
 THE POWER TO PUNISH AN OFFICER, UPON A PLEA OF GUILTY OR  A  FINDING  OF
 GUILTY AFTER AN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIAL, BY REPRIMAND, FORFEITING AND WITH-
 HOLDING PAY FOR A SPECIFIED TIME, SUSPENSION, SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY, OR
 BY  DISMISSAL  FROM THE FORCE. NO MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS' SALARY SHALL BE
 FORFEITED OR DEDUCTED FOR ANY OFFENSE. MEMBERS OF THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT
 MAY  BE  FINED,  REPRIMANDED,  REMOVED,  SUSPENDED OR DISMISSED FROM THE
 FORCE ONLY ON WRITTEN CHARGES MADE AND  PREFERRED  AGAINST  THEM,  AFTER
 SUCH  CHARGES  HAVE BEEN EXAMINED, HEARD AND INVESTIGATED BY THE HEARING
 OFFICER, BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE, UPON SUCH REASONABLE NOTICE
 TO THE MEMBER OF SERVICE CHARGED, AND IN SUCH MANNER OR PROCEDURE, PRAC-
 TICE, EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION AS PRESCRIBED, TO THE EXTENT  APPLI-
 CABLE  UNDER  SECTIONS  15-03  AND 15-04 OF THE RULES OF THE CITY OF NEW
 YORK.
  3. THE CONDUCT OF SUCH HEARINGS SHALL FOLLOW, TO THE  EXTENT  APPLICA-
 BLE,  THE  PARAMETERS SPECIFIED IN SECTIONS 15-03 AND 15-04 OF THE RULES
 OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
  4. ATTORNEYS FROM THE BOARD'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROSECUTION UNIT SHALL BE
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROSECUTION OF CASES BEFORE THE HEARING OFFICER.
  (E) Cooperation of police department.
  1. It shall be the duty of  the  police  department  to  provide  such
 assistance  as the board may reasonably request, to cooperate fully with
 investigations by the board, and to provide to the  board  upon  request
 records  and  other  materials  which  are  necessary for investigations
 undertaken pursuant to this chapter, except such  records  or  materials
 that cannot be disclosed by law.
  2. The police commissioner shall ensure that officers and employees of
 the  police  department  appear  before  and respond to inquiries of the
 board and its civilian investigators in connection  with  investigations
 AND PROSECUTIONS undertaken pursuant to this chapter, provided that such
 inquiries  are  conducted  in  accordance with department procedures for
 interrogation of members.
  [3. The police commissioner shall report to the board  in  writing  on
 any  action  taken,  including  the  level of discipline and any penalty
 imposed, in all cases in which the board submitted a finding  or  recom-
 mendation to the police commissioner with respect to a matter within its
 jurisdiction  pursuant to this section. In any case substantiated by the
 board in which the police commissioner intends to impose or has  imposed
 a  different penalty or level of discipline than that recommended by the
 board or by the deputy commissioner responsible for making  disciplinary
 recommendations,  the  police  commissioner  shall  provide such written
 report, with notice to the subject officer, no later than 45 days  after
 S. 2108  5

 the  imposition  of such discipline or in such shorter time frame as may
 be required pursuant to an agreement between the police commissioner and
 the board. Such report shall  include  a  detailed  explanation  of  the
 reasons for deviating from the board's recommendation or the recommenda-
 tion  of  the  deputy  commissioner  responsible for making disciplinary
 recommendations and, in cases in which the police  commissioner  intends
 to  impose or has imposed a penalty or level of discipline that is lower
 than that recommended by the board or such  deputy  commissioner,  shall
 also  include  an  explanation of how the final disciplinary outcome was
 determined, including each factor the police commissioner considered  in
 making his or her decision.
  (e)]  (F)  The  provisions  of  this section shall not be construed to
 limit [or impair the authority of the police commissioner to  discipline
 members  of  the department. Nor shall the provisions of this section be
 construed to limit] the rights of members of the department with respect
 to disciplinary action, including but not limited to the right to notice
 and a hearing, which may be established  by  any  provision  of  law  or
 otherwise.
  [(f)]  (G)  The  provisions  of this section shall not be construed to
 prevent or hinder the investigation or prosecution  of  members  of  the
 department for violations of law by any court of competent jurisdiction,
 a  grand jury, district attorney, or other authorized officer, agency or
 body.
  [(g)] (H) 1. Beginning in fiscal year 2021 and for  each  fiscal  year
 thereafter,  the  appropriations  available  to  pay  for  the  personal
 services expenses of the civilian complaint  review  board  during  each
 fiscal year shall not be less than an amount sufficient to fund personal
 services  costs  for  the  number  of full-time personnel plus part-time
 personnel, calculated based on full-time  equivalency  rates,  equal  to
 0.65  percent  of the number of uniform budgeted headcount of the police
 department for that fiscal year, as determined consistent with published
 budgeted headcount documents of the office of management and budget. The
 calculation to determine the minimum  appropriations  for  the  personal
 services  expenses  of  the  civilian complaint review board pursuant to
 this paragraph shall be set forth in the preliminary expense budget, the
 executive expense budget, and the adopted budget.
  2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and in addition to any action that  may
 be  undertaken  pursuant to section 106, the appropriations available to
 pay for the personal services expenses of the civilian complaint  review
 board  may be less than the minimum appropriations required by paragraph
 1 provided that, prior to adoption of the budget pursuant to section 254
 or prior to the adoption of a budget modification  pursuant  to  section
 107,  the mayor determines that such reduction is fiscally necessary and
 that such reduction is part of a plan to decrease overall appropriations
 or is due to unforeseen financial  circumstances,  and  the  mayor  sets
 forth  the  basis  for such determinations in writing to the council and
 the civilian complaint  review  board  at  the  time  of  submission  or
 adoption, as applicable, of any budget or budget modification containing
 such reduction.
  § 3. Section 14-115 of the administrative code of the city of New York

 offense, or neglect of duty, violation of rules, or neglect or disobedi-
 ence  of  orders,  or absence without leave, or any conduct injurious to
 the public peace or welfare, or immoral conduct or conduct unbecoming an
 officer,  or  any breach of discipline, to punish the offending party by
 reprimand, forfeiting and withholding pay for a specified time,  suspen-
 sion,  without  pay  during  such  suspension,  or by dismissal from the
 force; but no more than  thirty  days'  salary  shall  be  forfeited  or
 deducted  for  any offense. All such forfeitures shall be paid forthwith
 into the police pension fund.
  b. Members of the force, except as elsewhere provided herein, shall be
 fined, reprimanded, removed, suspended or dismissed from the force  only
 on  written  charges  made or preferred against them, after such charges
 have been examined, heard and investigated by the commissioner or one of
 his or her deputies upon such reasonable notice to the member or members
 charged, and in such manner  or  procedure,  practice,  examination  and
 investigation  as  such commissioner may, by rules and regulations, from
 time to time prescribe. WHERE THE MEMBER OF  THE  FORCE  IS  SUBJECT  TO
 BEING  FINED,  REPRIMANDED,  REMOVED,  SUSPENDED,  OR DISMISSED FROM THE
 FORCE AS A RESULT OF A COMPLAINT SUBSTANTIATED BY THE CIVILIAN COMPLAINT
 REVIEW BOARD, THE WRITTEN CHARGES MADE OR PREFERRED AGAINST  THE  MEMBER
 OF  THE  FORCE  SHALL  BE EXAMINED, HEARD, AND INVESTIGATED BY A HEARING

 TICE, EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION AS PRESCRIBED, TO THE EXTENT  APPLI-
 CABLE  UNDER  SECTIONS  15-03  AND 15-04 OF THE RULES OF THE CITY OF NEW
 YORK.

 discretion,  EXCEPT  CIVILIAN  COMPLAINTS  DETERMINED  BY  THE  CIVILIAN
 COMPLAINT  REVIEW  BOARD,  IN  WHICH  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  HAVE  NO
 DISCRETION,  to deduct and withhold salary from any member or members of
 the force, for or on account of absence for  any  cause  without  leave,
 lost  time,  sickness or other disability, physical or mental; provided,
 however, that the salary so deducted and withheld shall not,  except  in
 case of absence without leave, exceed one-half thereof for the period of
 such absence; and provided, further, that not more than one-half pay for
 three days shall be deducted on account of absence caused by sickness.
  d.  Upon  having  found  a  member  of the force guilty of the charges
 preferred against him or her, either upon such member's plea  of  guilty
 or  after  trial,  the commissioner or the deputy examining, hearing and
 investigating the charges, in his or  her  discretion,  EXCEPT  CIVILIAN
 COMPLAINTS  DETERMINED  BY THE CIVILIAN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD, IN WHICH
 THE COMMISSIONER SHALL HAVE NO  DISCRETION,  may  suspend  judgment  and
 place  the  member  of  the  force so found guilty upon probation, for a
 period not exceeding one year; and the commissioner may  impose  punish-
 ment at any time during such period.
  §  4. Nothing in this act shall make the discipline of police officers
 of the police department of the city of New York subject  to  collective
 bargaining  or arbitration or remove police discipline from local gover-
 nance.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
