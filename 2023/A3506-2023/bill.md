 Introduced  by  M.  of A. ZEBROWSKI, KELLES -- read once and referred to
  the Committee on Economic Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the economic development law, in relation to  establish-
  ing the Supply Chain Transparency Assistance Program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The Legislature  finds  and  declares
 the following:
  1.  The climate crisis is an immediate and urgent threat, and New York
 State is and must continue to be a leader in addressing it. New York has
 a statutory goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas  emissions  econo-
 my-wide  by  2050.  However,  that  goal does not include greenhouse gas
 emissions created outside of New York in the extraction, production, and
 transport of the goods  we  purchase.  Currently,  eight  global  supply
 chains  - food, construction, fashion, fast-moving consumer goods, elec-
 tronics, automobiles, professional services, and freight -  account  for
 over half of greenhouse gas emissions annually.  Increasing supply chain
 transparency  and  traceability is an important part of fighting climate
 change and moving global production toward more environmentally sustain-
 able practices.
  2. The International Labor Organization estimates that over 25 million
 people are currently caught in forced labor, 4 million of whom are chil-
 dren. Over 160 million children between the ages of  five  to  seventeen
 are  engaged  in  child labor in 2021, and about 79 million of those are
 estimated to be engaged in hazardous labor. Across  the  United  States,
 Canada  and  the  European  Union  there are estimated to be 1.5 million
 people trapped in forced labor, while  millions  of  other  people  live
 trapped  in  forced  labor across the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, Latin
 America and the Middle East. The fruit of such forced labor, as well  as
 additional  health  and  safety risks and other impacts from substandard
 labor practices, can potentially be  found  in  many  of  the  goods  we

 consume,  making  it  incumbent  on  businesses to take action to ensure
 ethical labor practices throughout their supply chains.
  3.  Businesses  throughout  the United States and across the world are
 increasingly engaged in efforts to ensure their supply chains are trans-
 parent,  traceable,  ethical,  and  environmentally  sound,  whether  in
 reaction  to  consumer  pressure  or government regulation, or out of an
 understanding  of  corporate  social  responsibility.  Businesses  that
 achieve  ethical  and  sustainable  supply  chains  may  also be able to
 increase their appeal with certain consumers, charge premium prices,  or
 access  previously  untapped  markets  as  a result of their efforts. In
 order to remain competitive, New York businesses, particularly small and
 medium-sized businesses and minority- and women-owned  businesses,  must
 be able to take advantage of and stay ahead of this socially responsible
 and beneficial trend.
  4.  It  is  therefore the intent of the Legislature to create a Supply
 Chain Transparency Assistance Program to encourage the shifting  of  the
 state's economy toward more ethical and sustainable supply chains, while
 ensuring  New York businesses have the tools they need to compete in the
 national and global marketplace.
