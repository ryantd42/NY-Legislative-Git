  HONORING  James  Sullivan upon the occasion of his
  designation for special recognition after  50  years
  of dedicated service to the Snyder Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  Firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to honor James
"Sully" Sullivan upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  50  years  of  dedicated  service to the Snyder Fire
Department to be  celebrated  at  this  year's  Installation  Dinner  on
Saturday, April 22, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  James  Sullivan  has  consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  lifelong  resident of Amherst, New York, James Sullivan
joined the Snyder Fire Department in 1973; throughout his  50  years  of
service,  he  has  held several offices within the Department including:
Examining Board member and long-time, as well as,  current  Director  on
the Board of Directors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
James Sullivan is one such firefighter; throughout 50 years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor James Sullivan upon the occasion of his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  50  years  of  dedicated  service to the Snyder Fire
Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to James Sullivan.
