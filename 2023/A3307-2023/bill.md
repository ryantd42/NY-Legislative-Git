  the  department  of  public  health to prepare and disseminate certain

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The  legislature  declares  that  it  finds,  according  to
 contemporary medical research, all of the following:
  1. As many as thirty percent of natural pregnancies end in spontaneous
 miscarriage.
  2.  Less than five percent of all natural pregnancies end in spontane-
 ous miscarriage after detection of fetal cardiac activity.
  3. Over ninety percent of  in  vitro  pregnancies  survive  the  first
 trimester if cardiac activity is detected in the gestational sac.
  4.  Nearly  ninety  percent of in vitro pregnancies do not survive the
 first trimester where cardiac activity is not detected in the gestation-
 al sac.
  5. Fetal heartbeat, therefore, has become a key medical predictor that
 an unborn human individual will reach live birth.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 3307  2
 
  6. Cardiac activity begins at a biologically  identifiable  moment  in
 time, normally when the fetal heart is formed in the gestational sac.
  7.  The  state of New York has legitimate interests from the outset of
 the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life  of  an
 unborn human individual who may be born.
  8.  In  order to make an informed choice about whether to continue her
 pregnancy, the pregnant woman has a legitimate interest in  knowing  the
 likelihood  of  the  fetus  surviving  to full-term birth based upon the
 presence of cardiac activity.
