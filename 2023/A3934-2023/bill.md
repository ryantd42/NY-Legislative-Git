 Introduced  by M. of A. FAHY, SEAWRIGHT, SIMON -- read once and referred
  to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  a recycling program for containers of adult-use cannabis
  sold in New York, and requiring such containers to be made of at least
  fifty percent recycled materials
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 27-1001 of the environmental conservation law, as
 amended by section 1 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws  of  2009,  is
 amended to read as follows:
 § 27-1001. Legislative findings.
  The  legislature hereby finds that litter composed of discarded bever-
 age containers AND OTHER SINGLE USE CONTAINERS is a growing  problem  of
 state  concern and a direct threat to the health and safety of the citi-
 zens of this state. Discarded beverage containers AND OTHER  SINGLE  USE
 CONTAINERS  create  a  hazard to vehicular traffic, a source of physical
 injury to pedestrians and farm animals,  a  hazard  to  farm  and  other
 machinery and an unsightly accumulation of litter which must be disposed
 of  at  increasing  public expense. Beverage containers AND OTHER SINGLE
 USE CONTAINERS also create an unnecessary addition to  the  state's  and
 municipalities'  already  overburdened  solid  waste and refuse disposal
 systems. Unsegregated disposal of such containers creates an  impediment
 to  the  efficient  operation  of resource recovery plants. Further, the
 legislature finds that the uninhibited discard  of  beverage  containers
 AND  OTHER SINGLE USE CONTAINERS constitutes a waste of both mineral and
 energy resources. The legislature hereby finds that requiring a  deposit
 on  all  beverage  containers  AND SINGLE USE CANNABIS CONTAINERS, along
 with certain other  facilitating  measures,  will  provide  a  necessary
 incentive  for  the  economically  efficient  and environmentally benign
 collection and recycling of such containers.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  12. No person shall intentionally program, tamper with, render inaccu-
 rate, or circumvent the proper operation of a reverse vending machine to

  § 8. Subdivisions 1, 3 and 4 of section 27-1013 of  the  environmental
 conservation  law,  subdivisions 1 and 3 as amended and subdivision 4 as
 added by section 7 of part F of chapter 58 of  the  laws  of  2013,  are
 amended to read as follows:
 A. 3934  10
 
  1.  The commissioner is hereby empowered to promulgate rules and regu-
 lations governing (a) the circumstances  in  which  deposit  initiators,
 dealers  and distributors, individually or collectively, are required to
 accept the return of empty beverage OR  CANNABIS  containers,  including
 beverage  OR  CANNABIS  containers  processed  through  reverse  vending
 machines and make payment therefor; (b) the sorting  of  the  containers
 which  a  deposit  initiator  or  distributor may require of dealers and
 redemption centers; (c) the collection of returned beverage OR  CANNABIS
 containers by deposit initiators or distributors, including the party to
 whom  such  expense is to be charged, the frequency of such pick ups and
 the payment for refunds and handling fees  thereon;  (d)  the  right  of
 dealers  to  restrict  or  limit  the number of containers redeemed, the
 rules for redemption at the dealers' place of business, and the  redemp-
 tion  of containers from a beverage for which sales have been discontin-
 ued; (e) to issue registrations to persons, firms or corporations  which
 establish  redemption centers, subject to applicable provisions of local
 and state laws, at which redeemers and dealers may return empty beverage
 OR CANNABIS containers and receive payment of the refund value  of  such
 beverage  OR  CANNABIS containers. Such registrations shall be issued at
 no cost. Should the department require by regulations  adopted  pursuant
 to  this paragraph that redemption centers must obtain a registration as
 a condition of operation, any redemption center in business as of  March
 first,  two  thousand  thirteen  that previously provided the department
 with the notification information required by regulations in  effect  as
 of  such  date  may  continue to operate as if the department had issued
 such redemption center a registration required  by  regulations  adopted
 under  this  paragraph;  provided,  however, that such redemption center
 shall provide the department with  any  other  information  required  by
 regulations  adopted  pursuant  to this paragraph.  The department may,
 after due notice and opportunity of hearing, pursuant to the  provisions
 of  section  71-1709  of  this  chapter, deny an application or revoke a
 registration. In determining whether or not to revoke a registration the
 commissioner shall at a minimum, take into consideration the  compliance
 history  of  a violator, good faith efforts of a violator to comply, any
 economic benefit from noncompliance and whether the violation was proce-
 dural in nature. The commissioner's determination to revoke a  registra-
 tion is subject to review under article seventy-eight of the civil prac-
 tice  law  and rules; and (f) the operation of mobile redemption centers
 in order to ensure that to the best extent  practicable  containers  are
 not  proffered  for  redemption  to  a  deposit initiator or distributor
 outside of the  geographic  area  where  such  deposit  initiator  sells
 containers and initiates deposits.
  3.  No  dealer  or  distributor, as defined in section 27-1003 of this
 title, shall be required to obtain a  permit  to  operate  a  redemption
 center  at  the  same location as the dealer's or distributor's place of
 business. Operators of such redemption centers shall receive payment  of
 the  refund value of each beverage OR CANNABIS container from the appro-
 priate deposit  initiator  or  distributor  as  provided  under  section
 27-1007 of this title.
  4.  Each dealer and redemption center shall require any person tender-
 ing for redemption more than two thousand five hundred containers at one
 time to such dealer or redemption center to provide such  person's  name
 and  address  and the license plate of the vehicle used to transport the
 containers, or, in the case of an agent or employee of a  not-for-profit
 corporation, a sales tax exemption certificate. The dealer or redemption
 center  redeeming  the  beverage  OR  CANNABIS containers shall keep the
 A. 3934  11
 
 information on file for a minimum of twelve months and provide  same  to
 the department upon request.
  §  9.  Subdivisions 3, 4 and 6 of section 27-1015 of the environmental
 conservation law, subdivisions 3 and 4 as amended and subdivision  6  as
 added  by  section  8  of  part F of chapter 58 of the laws of 2013, are
 amended to read as follows:
  3. It shall be unlawful for a distributor or deposit initiator, acting
 alone or aided by another, to return  any  empty  beverage  OR  CANNABIS
 container  to  a dealer or redemption center for its refund value if the
 distributor or deposit initiator had previously accepted  such  beverage
 OR CANNABIS container from any dealer or operator of a redemption center
 or  if  such  container  was  previously  accepted  by a reverse vending
 machine. A violation of this subdivision shall be a misdemeanor punisha-
 ble by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor  more  than  one
 thousand  dollars  and  an amount equal to two times the amount of money
 received as a result of such violation.
  4. Any person who willfully tenders to a dealer, distributor,  redemp-
 tion center or deposit initiator more than forty-eight empty beverage OR
 CANNABIS  containers  for  which  such person knows or should reasonably
 know that no deposit was paid in New York state may be assessed  by  the
 department  a  civil  penalty  of  up  to  one  hundred dollars for each
 container or up to twenty-five thousand dollars for each such tender  of
 containers.  At  each  location  where  a  person tenders containers for
 redemption, dealers and redemption centers must conspicuously display  a
 sign  in letters that are at least one inch in height with the following
 information: "WARNING:  Persons tendering for redemption  containers  on
 which  a  deposit was never paid in this state may be subject to a civil
 penalty of up to one hundred dollars per container or up to  twenty-five
 thousand  dollars for each such tender of containers." Any civil penalty
 may be assessed following a hearing or opportunity to be heard.
  6. (a) Any person who willfully violates or directs another to violate
 the requirements to collect  or  charge  the  refund  value  imposed  by
 section 27-1005 or paragraph a of subdivision nine of section 27-1012 of
 this  title  on five thousand or more beverage OR CANNABIS containers in
 one or more separate transactions within one year shall be guilty  of  a
 class B misdemeanor.
  (b)  Any  person,  having  previously been convicted of a violation of
 paragraph (a) of this section within the past three years, who willfully
 violates or directs another to violate the requirements  to  collect  or
 charge  the  refund  value  imposed by section 27-1005 or paragraph a of
 subdivision nine of section 27-1012 of this title on  five  thousand  or
 more  beverage  OR  CANNABIS  containers  in one or more separate trans-
 actions within one year shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.
  (c) Any person who willfully violates or directs  another  to  violate
 the  requirements  to  collect  or  charge  the  refund value imposed by
 section 27-1005 or paragraph a of subdivision nine of section 27-1012 of
 this title on twenty thousand or more beverage OR CANNABIS containers in
 one or more separate transactions within one year shall be guilty  of  a
 class E felony.
  Nothing in this subdivision shall apply to common or contract carriers
 or  warehousemen  while engaged in lawfully transporting or storing such
 containers as merchandise, nor to any employee of such carrier or  ware-
 houseman acting within the scope of his or her employment.
  §  10. Section 27-1016 of the environmental conservation law, as added
 by section 12 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws of 2009,  is  amended
 to read as follows:

  The commissioner shall establish a public education program to dissem-
 inate  information regarding implementation of this title. Such informa-
 tion shall include, but not be limited to, publication of the  New  York
 Bottle Bill of Rights AND THE NEW YORK CANNABIS CONTAINER BILL OF RIGHTS
 as specified in subdivision two of section 27-1007 of this title; publi-
 cation of information specifying the procedures necessary to establish a

 ing information regarding financial assistance available for the  estab-
 lishment  of  redemption  centers as provided in section 27-1018 of this

 tion centers and redeemers under the provisions of this title;  publica-
 tion  of  information  regarding the requirement that deposit initiators

 information on the general benefits of recycling.
  § 11. Section 27-1018 of the environmental conservation law, as  added
 by  section  13 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws of 2009, is amended
 to read as follows:
 § 27-1018. Beverage OR CANNABIS container assistance program.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, within the
 limits of appropriations therefor, the  commissioner  shall  make  state
 assistance  payments  to  municipalities,  businesses and not-for-profit
 organizations located in the state  for  the  cost  of  reverse  vending
 machines  located  or  to be located in the state. Such state assistance
 payments shall not exceed fifty  percent  of  the  costs  of  equipment,
 and/or  the acquisition and/or rehabilitation of real property or struc-
 tures located or to be located in the state related to  the  collecting,
 sorting,  and packaging of empty beverage OR CANNABIS containers subject
 to the provisions of this title. Such payments may include costs related
 to the establishment of redemption centers, including mobile  redemption
 centers.  For  the purposes of this section, municipalities and not-for-
 profit organizations shall  have  the  meaning  as  defined  in  section
 54-0101  of this chapter and businesses shall mean a dealer, distributor
 or redemption center as defined in this title  that  employs  less  than
 fifty employees.
  §  12.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law. Effective immediately,  the  addition,
 amendment  and/or  repeal  of  any  rule or regulation necessary for the
 implementation of this act on its effective date are  authorized  to  be
 made and completed on or before such effective date.
