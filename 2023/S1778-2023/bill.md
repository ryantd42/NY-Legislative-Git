 AN  ACT  to  amend  the general business law, in relation to immigration
  bonds and disclosures for providers of immigrant assistant services

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general business law is amended by adding a new section
 460-d-1 to read as follows:
  §  460-D-1.  RESTRICTIONS ON BONDS. 1. (A) NO BOND AGENT OR PERSON WHO
 UNDERWRITES OR INSURES THE PROVISION OF AN  IMMIGRATION  OR  OTHER  BAIL
 BOND  WHO REQUIRES THE USE OF AN ANKLE MONITOR OR OTHER HOMING DEVICE AS
 A CONDITION FOR THE PROVISION OF SUCH A BOND MAY CHARGE ANY FEE FOR SUCH
 MONITOR OR DEVICE THAT EXCEEDS THE COST  OF  MAINTAINING  AND  OPERATING
 SUCH  MONITOR  OR  DEVICE CHARGED TO THE BOND AGENT OR PERSON WHO UNDER-
 WRITES OR INSURES THE PROVISION OF THE BOND.
  (B) ANY FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MONITOR OR DEVICE CHARGED PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE INCLUDED IN  CALCULATING  THE
 LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENT FOR A GIVEN BOND.
  (C)  NO  BOND AGENT OR PERSON WHO UNDERWRITES OR INSURES THE PROVISION
 OF AN IMMIGRATION OR OTHER BAIL BOND WHO REQUIRES THE USE  OF  AN  ANKLE
 MONITOR  OR OTHER HOMING DEVICE AS A CONDITION FOR THE PROVISION OF SUCH
 A BOND MAY PROHIBIT SUCH MONITOR OR DEVICE FROM BEING REMOVED, OR CHARGE
 ANY FEE FOR SUCH REMOVAL OR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT, IN CASE OF A MEDICAL
 NECESSITY OR REASONABLE FEAR OF A MEDICAL NECESSITY.  ANY STATEMENT  TO
 THE  CONTRARY,  WHETHER  MADE IN WRITING OR ORALLY, RENDERS THE CONTRACT
 VOIDABLE BY THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM THE BOND IS PROVIDED.
  2. NO BOND AGENT OR PERSON WHO UNDERWRITES OR INSURES THE PROVISION OF
 AN IMMIGRATION OR OTHER BAIL BOND SHALL  CHARGE  A  PREMIUM  OR  RECEIVE
 COMPENSATION IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION SIX
 THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR OF THE INSURANCE LAW.
