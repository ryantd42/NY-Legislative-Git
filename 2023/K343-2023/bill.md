BY: M. of A. Thiele
 
  COMMEMORATING the 100th Anniversary of Goldsmith's
  Boat Shop, the oldest continuously run marina in the
  country
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements of those  individuals  and  recreational  businesses  which
substantially  contribute  to the economic vitality of their communities
and the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Goldsmith's Boat Shop,  the  oldest
continuously run marina in the country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1923,  Alvah  Goldsmith  Sr.,  who  lived on a farm in
Peconic and worked in a car dealership, began a side business of selling
Evinrude outboard motors from the front porch of his house; his business
thrived, and by 1930, he purchased land at Founders Landing in Southold,
New York, and set up a marina and boat-building business; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of Alvah Goldsmith Sr.'s early customers  were  owners
of  fishing  stations in the town; after World War II broke out, he took
regular trips into New York City  to  meet  officials  with  the  United
States  Navy  to promote his business as a place where boats for the war
effort could be constructed; and
 
  WHEREAS, During that time, Alvah Goldsmith Sr. and approximately  50
employees  worked  seven  days  a  week  to  build  150 ships which held
torpedoes that  could  be  transported  out  on  the  water  to  waiting
seaplanes  for  the  United  States  Navy at Founders Landing; after the
boats were built, they were tested in the bay and then delivered to  the
United States Navy on trains from Southold; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the  end of the war in 1945, the contracts ceased, and
Alvah Goldsmith Sr. decided to buy land on Mill Creek in 1947, to  start
his recreational boating business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the  death of his father, Alvah Goldsmith Sr., Alvah
Goldsmith Jr. took over the business which he had worked  in  since  the
young  age  of  14;  today,  Goldsmith's  continues to prosper under the
luminous leadership of Alvah Jr.'s sons, Glenn and Craig Goldsmith; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  business  and  its contributions to the
local and State economies, fully confident  that  it  will  continue  to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th Anniversary of Goldsmith's Boat Shop, the oldest
continuously run marina in the country; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Glenn and Craig Goldsmith, Goldsmith's Boat Shop.
