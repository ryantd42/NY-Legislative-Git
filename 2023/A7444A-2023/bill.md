 SYSTEM  OF THE STATE, EXCLUDING ANY TRANSFERS WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE NEW
 YORK  CITY  EMPLOYEES'  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM,  THE NEW YORK CITY TEACHERS'
 RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD  OF  EDUCATION  RETIREMENT
 SYSTEM.  For the purpose of giving the transferring member such status
 and crediting such service in the retirement system to which the  member
 is transferring as such member was allowed in the retirement system from
 which  the member has transferred, the transfer shall be deemed complete
 upon receipt by the transferee retirement system of (a) a statement from
 the transferor retirement system of the transferring  member's  date  of
 membership  in  the  transferor  retirement system, tier status, service
 credited to the transferred membership, and such  other  information  as
 the transferee retirement system may require to effectuate the transfer,
 [and]  (b)  such  member's accumulated contributions from the transferor
 retirement system, if same had not been previously withdrawn, or  notice
 from  the  transferor  retirement system that such member had no accumu-
 lated contributions, or notice from  the  transferor  retirement  system
 that  such member's accumulated contributions had been withdrawn and the
 amount thereof and, as applicable, receipt  from  such  member  of  such
 member's  accumulated  contributions  and  interest, AND (C) THE PENSION

  § 2. Subdivisions k and l of section 43 of the retirement  and  social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 41 of the laws of 2009, are amended
 to read as follows:
  k. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any member  of
 the  New  York  state  and local employees' retirement system or the New
 York city teachers' retirement system  who  retired  from  service  from
 either  the  New  York city employees' retirement system or the New York
 city board of education retirement system as  a  member  of  the  career
 pension plan maintained by such system and who, but for the fact that he
 or she retired, would be eligible for transfer and who has not, in fact,
 received a pension payment from such system shall be permitted to trans-
 fer  his  or her retirement system membership pursuant to the provisions
 of this section. In such event, the application for retirement shall  be
 deemed  to  have been rescinded and the retirement system from which the
 service shall be transferred shall transfer the appropriate reserves  as
 provided by this section, provided, however, that with respect to trans-
 fers  pursuant  to this subdivision which occur on or after the [twenty-
 sixth day of October, two thousand four] EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE  CHAPTER
 OF  THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE THAT AMENDED THIS SUBDIVISION,
 except for the purposes of providing the benefits, if any,  of  subdivi-
 sion  four  of  section five hundred twenty-two of the education law, no
 determination of a reserve pursuant to subdivision c of this section  or
 transfer thereof pursuant to the first sentence of subdivision d of this
 section  shall  be required in the case of any transfer pursuant to this

 year-increased-service-fraction plan who has received a pension  payment
 or  payments  from  such  system shall be eligible for the provisions of
 this subdivision upon payment, to the retirement system from  which  the

 section or transfer thereof pursuant to the first sentence  of  subdivi-
 sion  d  of  this  section shall be required in the case of any transfer

 ment system to said police pension fund [shall not be required]  WHEN  A

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend  Section 522 of the Education Law and various
 sections of the Retirement and Social Security Law and  the  Administra-
 tive  Code  of  the  City of New York to require the transfer of pension
 reserves between retirement systems in cases in which a  member  of  the
 New  York  State  Teachers' Retirement System (NYSTRS) or any Retirement
 System of the State or City of New York transfers a membership with  ten
 or more years of credited service at the time the transfer is initiated.
 This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any membership
 transfer initiated on or after the effective date of this act. No trans-
 fer  of  reserves  will be required for transfers within and between the
 NYC Retirement Systems. The current transfer of reserves that occurs due
 to transfers between the police and fire systems shall not be disturbed.
  It is estimated that there will be no additional annual  cost  to  the
 employers  of  members  of  the NYSTRS if this bill is enacted. In fact,
 this bill will greatly increase equity between the retirement systems of
 the state by ensuring that a member who  transfers  with  a  significant
 liability  will bring with him or her the pension reserve accumulated by
 the prior retirement system to offset the liability assumed by  the  new
 retirement system.
  Member  data  is  from  the  System's  most recent actuarial valuation
 files, consisting of data provided by the employers  to  the  Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the System's
 Annual Report. System assets are as reported in the  System's  financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al  assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-1  dated  October  14,
 2022  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2023
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend sections 43 and 343 of the Retirement and Social
 Security  Law and various sections of the Education Law and the Adminis-
 trative Code of the City of New York to reinstate  the  calculation  and
 transfer  of  a  pension  reserve  for a member transferring between the
 public retirement systems in New York State,  provided  such  member  is
 transferring ten (10) or more years of service credit.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS) and the New York State and Local Police  and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this legislation is enacted during
 the 2023 legislative session, there would be some ongoing administrative
 costs to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The  actuarial  gains and losses arising from the transfer of reserves
 is expected to net to zero over the long term, making the proposal  cost
 neutral.
  Summary of relevant resources:

 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2022  Report  of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.

  This estimate, dated January 3, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-005,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation (see Appendix) would amend
 Sections 43 and 343 of the Retirement and Social  Security  Law  (RSSL),
 Sections 13-143 and 13-144 of the Administrative Code of the City of New
 York  (ACCNY),  Section 522 of the Education Law, and Chapter 666 of the
 laws of 1990 to reinstate the transfer of reserves between  certain  New
 York City and State retirement systems.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND:  Chapter  647 of the Laws of 2004, for purposes of stream-
 lining transfers between certain public retirement systems and alleviat-
 ing the administrative burden of  reserve  calculations  and  transfers,
 eliminated the transfer of reserves as a required step in completing the
 transfer of memberships between certain public retirement systems within
 New  York.  This proposed legislation would repeal parts of Chapter 647
 and eliminate the administrative efficiencies created by such law.
  Currently, members of the New York City Employees'  Retirement  System
 (NYCERS), the New York City Teachers' Retirement System (NYCTRS), or the
 New  York  City  Board  of Education Retirement System (BERS) who accept
 another position that entitles them to membership in  another  New  York
 public  retirement  system may choose to transfer their membership. Upon
 successful application for such  transfer,  certain  member  accumulated
 contributions  (with  accrued  interest)  are generally transferred, but
 additional employer paid reserves are not.
  Under the proposed legislation, if enacted, when members with a  mini-
 mum of 10 years of Credited Service transfer their membership to another
 retirement system, the originating system would be required to calculate
 and  pay  such  member's  pension reserve, net of any accumulated salary
 deductions otherwise transferred, to the destination retirement  system.
 Such  transfers  of  reserves  would  not be required for members trans-
 ferring wholly between NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - OVERVIEW: It is not possible to accurately estimate
 the number of New York City Retirement System or  Pension  Fund  (NYCRS)
 members with at least 10 years of service who would potentially transfer
 between  affected  City  and  State  retirement  systems  in the future.
 Therefore, the estimated financial impact has been calculated on  a  per
 event  basis  equal  to the increase in Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL)
 for an average NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS member with at least 10 years of
 service. This increase in UAL consists of the  reserve  required  to  be
 transferred  to  the  State system, net of any member contributions that
 would otherwise be transferred.
  With respect to an individual member,  the  additional  cost  of  this
 proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's length
 of service, age, and salary history.
 A. 7444--A  9
 
  These  costs  would be offset by any reserves reciprocally transferred
 from a State system to a City system. Transfers  between  affected  City
 systems would not be expected to materially impact these costs.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - SUMMARY: The enactment of this proposed legislation
 would  not be expected to result in any material changes in the ultimate
 costs of the NYCRS but is expected to  increase  administrative  burdens
 and potentially delay member transfers.
  Enactment of this proposed legislation would, on transfers from a City
 system  to  a  State system, increase employer contributions, where such
 amount would depend on the number of members affected as well  as  other
 characteristics  including the age, years of service, and salary history
 of the member. A breakdown of the financial impact by System is shown in
 the table below.

  NYCERS  $307,000  $36,300
  NYCTRS  $396,000  $46,800
  BERS  $178,600  $21,100
 
  As there is no data currently available  to  accurately  estimate  the
 number  and  demographic  characteristics of members who may transfer to
 the State, the financial impact would  be  recognized  at  the  time  of
 event.  Consequently, changes in employer contributions have been esti-
 mated assuming that the increase in the UAL will  be  recognized  as  an
 actuarial  loss  and  financed over a closed 15-year period (14 payments
 under the One-Year Lag Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  With respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions  would
 depend  upon  when  eligible  members file their application to transfer
 their NYCRS membership to the State but, generally,  increased  employer
 contributions  will  first  occur  the  second fiscal year following the
 transfer of reserves to the State.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census

  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCRS.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.

  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial and ongoing, additional administrative costs to imple-
 ment the proposed legislation.
