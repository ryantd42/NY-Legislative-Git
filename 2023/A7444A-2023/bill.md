 upon receipt by the transferee retirement system of (a) a statement from
 the transferor retirement system of the transferring  member's  date  of
 membership  in  the  transferor  retirement system, tier status, service
 credited to the transferred membership, and such  other  information  as
 the transferee retirement system may require to effectuate the transfer,
 [and]  (b)  such  member's accumulated contributions from the transferor
 retirement system, if same had not been previously withdrawn, or  notice
 from  the  transferor  retirement system that such member had no accumu-
 lated contributions, or notice from  the  transferor  retirement  system

 either  the  New  York city employees' retirement system or the New York
 city board of education retirement system as  a  member  of  the  career
 pension plan maintained by such system and who, but for the fact that he
 or she retired, would be eligible for transfer and who has not, in fact,
 received a pension payment from such system shall be permitted to trans-
 fer  his  or her retirement system membership pursuant to the provisions
 of this section. In such event, the application for retirement shall  be
 deemed  to  have been rescinded and the retirement system from which the
 service shall be transferred shall transfer the appropriate reserves  as
 provided by this section, provided, however, that with respect to trans-
 fers  pursuant  to this subdivision which occur on or after the [twenty-
 sixth day of October, two thousand four] EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE  CHAPTER

 except for the purposes of providing the benefits, if any,  of  subdivi-
 sion  four  of  section five hundred twenty-two of the education law, no
 determination of a reserve pursuant to subdivision c of this section  or

 retiree covered by either the career pension  plan  or  the  fifty-five-
 year-increased-service-fraction  plan who has received a pension payment
 or payments from such system shall be eligible  for  the  provisions  of
 this  subdivision  upon payment, to the retirement system from which the

 sion d of this section shall be required in the  case  of  any  transfer

 subdivision, no determination or transfer of the reserve on the benefits
 allowable  to the transferring member as the result of employer contrib-
 utions,  including  the  reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay,  shall  be
 required  FOR A MEMBER WITH LESS THAN TEN YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE FROM
 THE TRANSFERRING SYSTEM AT THE TIME  THE  TRANSFER  IS  INITIATED.  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  TRANSFERS  PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION WHICH OCCUR ON OR AFTER
 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-
 THREE  THAT  AMENDED THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TRANSFER OF A PENSION RESERVE

 A. 7444  7
 
 NEW YORK CITY TEACHERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF
 EDUCATION RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
  §  7.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any
 covered membership transfer initiated on or after such  effective  date;
 provided,  however,  that  no provision of this act shall affect (a) the
 transfer of reserves required with respect to transfers between any  two
 of  the  New York state and local police and fire retirement system, the
 New York city police department subchapter two pension fund and the  New
 York  city  fire department subchapter two pension fund and with respect
 to transfers from the New York state and local police and  fire  retire-
 ment  system to the metropolitan transportation authority police pension
 fund; and (b) the transfer of reserves with respect to transfers  within
 and between the New York city employees' retirement system, the New York
 city  teachers'  retirement system and the New York city board of educa-
 tion retirement system.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend Section 522 of the  Education  Law  and  various
 sections  of  the Retirement and Social Security Law and the Administra-
 tive Code of the City of New York to require  the  transfer  of  pension
 reserves  between  retirement  systems in cases in which a member of the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System (NYSTRS)  or  any  Retirement
 System  of the State or City of New York transfers a membership with ten
 or more years of credited service at the time the transfer is initiated.
 This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any membership
 transfer initiated on or after the effective date of this act. No trans-
 fer of reserves will be required for transfers within  and  between  the
 NYC Retirement Systems. The current transfer of reserves that occurs due
 to transfers between the police and fire systems shall not be disturbed.
  It  is  estimated  that there will be no additional annual cost to the
 employers of members of the NYSTRS if this bill  is  enacted.  In  fact,
 this bill will greatly increase equity between the retirement systems of
 the  state  by  ensuring  that a member who transfers with a significant
 liability will bring with him or her the pension reserve accumulated  by
 the  prior  retirement system to offset the liability assumed by the new
 retirement system.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.
  The  source  of  this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-1 dated October 14,
 2022 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2023
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the
 American  Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend sections 43 and 343 of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and various sections of the Education Law and the  Adminis-
 trative  Code  of  the City of New York to reinstate the calculation and
 transfer of a pension reserve for  a  member  transferring  between  the
 A. 7444  8
 
 public  retirement  systems  in  New York State, provided such member is
 transferring ten (10) or more years of service credit.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS) and the New York State and Local Police  and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this legislation is enacted during
 the 2023 legislative session, there would be some ongoing administrative
 costs to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The  actuarial  gains and losses arising from the transfer of reserves
 is expected to net to zero over the long term, making the proposal  cost
 neutral.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2022  Report  of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.
  The actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in the  2020,
 2021,  and  2022  Annual  Report to the Comptroller on Actuarial Assump-
 tions, and the Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State  of  New  York:
