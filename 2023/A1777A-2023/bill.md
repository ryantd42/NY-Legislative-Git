 the health care professional a written explanation of  the  reasons  for

 provided  by  the health care plan to the health care professional shall
 include:
  (i) the reasons for the proposed action;
  (ii) notice that the health care professional has the right to request
 a hearing or review, at the professional's discretion,  before  a  panel
 [appointed  by  the  health  care plan] COMPRISED OF NO FEWER THAN THREE
 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS LICENSED TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK;
  (iii) a time limit of not less than thirty days within which a  health
 care professional may request a hearing; and

  (c) The hearing panel shall be comprised of three  [persons  appointed
 by  the health care plan] HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS LICENSED TO PRACTICE
 BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN THE SAME PROFESSION AS THE  SUBJECT  OF  THE
 REVIEW, ONE OF WHOM IS APPOINTED BY THE HEALTH CARE PLAN, ONE OF WHOM IS
 APPOINTED  BY  THE  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONAL WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE
 HEARING. THE REMAINING MEMBER OF THE PANEL SHALL BE CHOSEN BY THE  OTHER
 TWO PANEL MEMBERS. At least one person on such panel shall be a clinical
 peer  in  the  same  discipline and the same or similar specialty as the
 health care professional under review. The hearing panel may consist  of
 more  than  three  persons, provided however that the number of clinical
 peers on such panel shall constitute one-third  or  more  of  the  total
 membership  of  the  panel  AND  PROVIDED  FURTHER THAT THE RATIO OF THE
 NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS APPOINTED BY THE HEALTH CARE PLAN TO
 THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS APPOINTED BY THE SUBJECT OF  THE
 HEARING  TO  THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS CHOSEN BY THE OTHER
 PANEL MEMBERS REMAINS ONE TO ONE TO ONE.
  (d) The hearing panel shall render a decision on the  proposed  action
 in  a  timely  manner.  Such decision shall include reinstatement of the
 health care professional by the  health  care  plan,  provisional  rein-
 statement  subject  to  conditions  set forth by the health care plan or
 termination of the health care  professional.  Such  decision  shall  be
 provided in writing to the health care professional.
  (e) A decision by the hearing panel to terminate OR NOT RENEW a health
 care professional shall be effective not less than thirty days after the
 receipt by the health care professional of the hearing panel's decision;
 provided,  however,  that the provisions of paragraph (e) of subdivision
 six of section [four thousand four] FORTY-FOUR  hundred  three  of  this
 article shall apply to such termination OR NON-RENEWAL.
  (f) In no event shall termination be effective earlier than sixty days
 from the receipt of the notice of termination.
  3.  [Either party to a contract may exercise a right of non-renewal at
 the expiration of the contract  period  set  forth  therein  or,  for  a
 contract  without  a  specific  expiration  date,  on each January first
 occurring after the contract has been in effect for at least  one  year,
 upon  sixty  days notice to the other party; provided, however, that any
 non-renewal shall not constitute a  termination  for  purposes  of  this
 section.
  4.] A health care plan shall develop and implement policies and proce-
 dures to ensure that health care professionals are regularly informed of
 information  maintained by the health care plan to evaluate the perform-
 ance or practice of the health care professional. The health  care  plan
 shall consult with health care professionals in developing methodologies
 to  collect  and analyze health care professional profiling data. Health
 care plans shall provide any such information  and  profiling  data  and
 analysis  to health care professionals. Such information, data or analy-
 sis shall be provided on a periodic basis appropriate to the nature  and
 amount  of  data  and  the  volume and scope of services provided.  Any
 profiling data used to evaluate the performance or practice of a  health
 care  professional  shall  be  measured  against  stated criteria and an
 appropriate group of health care professionals using  similar  treatment
 modalities serving a comparable patient population. Upon presentation of
 such  information  or data, each health care professional shall be given
 the opportunity to discuss the unique nature of the health care  profes-
 sional's  patient population which may have a bearing on the health care
 professional's profile and to work cooperatively with  the  health  care
 plan to improve performance.

 tunity  for a hearing or review concerning such termination OR NON-RENE-
 WAL.
