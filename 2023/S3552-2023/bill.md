 Introduced  by  Sen. BRESLIN -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to licensing  of  genetic
  counselors
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent and findings. The legislature finds that
 while significant steps have been taken through legislation in  response
 to  the  COVID-19  crisis  in  New York State, much more must be done to
 combat the continued threat to public health  and  safety  presented  by
 COVID-19 and future pandemics including identifying risk factors, devel-
 oping responses, and increasing access to treatment.
  The  legislature intends to build on the initial efforts of the execu-
 tive and legislature in responding to the COVID-19 crisis by recognizing
 the significant role genetic  counselors  play  in  identifying  genetic
 variants  through  predictive  testing, investigating underlying genomic
 susceptibilities and deciphering complex testing infrastructures, culmi-
 nating in the critical counseling of patients and educating other health
 care providers.
  The legislature finds that the state's mission to ensure  preparedness
 against  future  health  crises  through  data collection, research, and
 access to safe care will be advanced through the  licensure  of  genetic
 counselors  and  the active engagement of these uniquely trained practi-
 tioners and researchers in the making of informed personal  health  care
 decisions and the development of effective health care policies.
  §  2. The education law is amended by adding a new article 142 to read
 as follows:
