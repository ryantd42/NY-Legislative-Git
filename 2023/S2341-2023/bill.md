 Introduced  by  Sen.  RIVERA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to the use  and  sale  of
  tobacco  at state-operated institutions of the state university of New
  York

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent. The legislature finds and declares
 that it shall be the policy of the state university of New  York  (SUNY)
 to  ensure that all state-operated campuses embrace a tobacco-free envi-
 ronment. Tobacco use is the number one preventable cause of death in the
 United States and accounts for more annual deaths than suicide,  murder,
 HIV/AIDS,  alcohol  use,  illegal  drug  use  and motor vehicle injuries
 combined. Using tobacco is a personal choice, a tobacco-free policy does
 not take away an individual's right to choose to use  tobacco,  it  does
 limit  where  a  person  may  use tobacco. SUNY respects an individual's
 right to choose to use tobacco off campus, in places where it is accept-
 able to do so. SUNY is first and foremost an educational institution.
  § 2. Section 355 of the education law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 22 to read as follows:
  22. THE FOLLOWING ARE PROHIBITED AT STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTIONS OF THE
 STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:
  A.  THE  USE  OR  SALE OF TOBACCO ON ALL GROUNDS AND FACILITIES OWNED,
 LEASED OR CONTROLLED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY OR  ITS  RELATED  ENTITIES,
 INCLUDING INDOOR AND OUTDOOR LOCATIONS; AND
  B. THE USE OF TOBACCO IN VEHICLES OWNED, RENTED OR LEASED BY THE STATE
 UNIVERSITY OR ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION,
 THE  "AFFILIATED  ENTITIES"  OF  THE  STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTIONS OF THE
 STATE UNIVERSITY ARE THE FOUNDATIONS, AUXILIARY  SERVICES  CORPORATIONS,
 AND ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS AND SUBSIDIARIES THEREOF.
  §  3. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become a
 law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
