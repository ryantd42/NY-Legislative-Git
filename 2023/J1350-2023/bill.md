local driving force in the world of advertising  for  an  impressive  50
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded by Don Romanelli, the family-owned agency holds its
corporate office in the beautiful orange-brick building on the corner of

Communications  has  had  the  privilege  of  partnering  with  national
clients, including the prestigious Boston Marathon,  where  they  worked
closely  with  the  Marathon's  organizers,  crafting  material that has
inspired and motivated  participants  from  all  walks  of  life;  their
creative  endeavors  have  celebrated  the  spirit,  resilience,  and

athletes; and

trusted, local institutions such as First Source Federal  Credit  Union,

in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
