 AN  ACT to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to eligibil-
  ity for classification as permanent total disability

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  1 of section 15 of the workers' compensation
 law, as amended by chapter 675 of the laws of 1977, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  1. Permanent total disability. In case of total disability adjudged to
 be  permanent  sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly
 wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of such total
 disability. Loss of both hands, or both arms,  or  both  feet,  or  both
 legs,  or  both eyes, or of any two thereof, OR INABILITY TO PERFORM THE
 FULL RANGE OF SEDENTARY WORK, OR APPROVAL FOR  FEDERAL  SOCIAL  SECURITY
 DISABILITY  BENEFITS  AS  A  RESULT OF A COMPENSABLE ACCIDENT OR OCCUPA-
 TIONAL DISEASE shall, in the absence of conclusive proof to the  contra-
 ry, constitute permanent total disability.  In all other cases permanent
 total  disability  shall  be  determined  in  accordance with the facts.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an injured employee
 disabled due to the loss or total loss of use  of  both  eyes,  or  both
 hands,  or  both arms, or both feet, or both legs, or of any two thereof
 shall not suffer any diminution of his compensation by engaging in busi-
 ness or employment provided his earnings or wages,  when  combined  with
 his  compensation,  shall not be in excess of the wage base on which the
 maximum weekly compensation benefit is computed under the law in  effect
 at  time  of  such  earning;  further  provided, that if the combination
 exceeds such wage base, the  compensation  shall  be  diminished  to  an
 amount  which, together with his earnings or wages, shall equal the wage
 base; and further provided that  the  application  of  this  subdivision

 shall  not result in reduction of compensation which an injured employee
 who is disabled due to the loss or total loss of use of  both  eyes,  or
 both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs or of any two ther-
 eof,  would  otherwise  be entitled to under any other provision of this
 section.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION,  INABILITY  TO  PERFORM  THE
 FULL RANGE OF SEDENTARY WORK SHALL MEAN THE INABILITY TO EXERT UP TO TEN
 POUNDS  OF  FORCE OCCASIONALLY OR UP TO ONE-THIRD OF THE WORKDAY, OR THE
 INABILITY TO EXERT A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT  OF  FORCE  FREQUENTLY  TO  LIFT,
 CARRY,  PUSH,  PULL, OR OTHERWISE MOVE OBJECTS, INCLUDING THE HOME BODY,
 AND EXAMPLES OF THE INABILITY TO PERFORM THE  FULL  RANGE  OF  SEDENTARY
 WORK  SHALL  INCLUDE  BUT  NOT BE LIMITED TO THE INABILITY TO SIT FOR AT
 LEAST SIX HOURS IN AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY AND OCCASIONALLY WALK OR STAND  FOR
 NO  MORE THAN TWO HOURS IN AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE
 INABILITY TO PERFORM THE FULL  RANGE  OF  SEDENTARY  WORK  INVOLVES  THE
 PERFORMANCE  OF UNSKILLED SEDENTARY WORK, RELATED ACTIVITIES OF A NON-E-
 XERTIONAL NATURE SUCH AS SEEING, HAND-MANIPULATION,  AND  UNDERSTANDING,
 REMEMBERING, AND CARRYING OUT SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS SHALL BE CONSIDERED.
  §  2.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to inju-
 ries subject to the provisions of the workers' compensation law  arising
 on and after the effective date of this act.
