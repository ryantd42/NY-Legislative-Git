  COMMEMORATING  the  1st Annual Honor Flight Day in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Services from the State of  New  York,
who  have  served  so  faithfully  and courageously in wars in which our
Nation's freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation  of  peace
during  peacetime,  deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with which these men and women served their country, and must  recognize
that  no  greater  debt  is  owed than that owed to those who gave their
lives for their beloved Nation and to those who continue to  be  missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
1st Annual Honor Flight Day in the State of New York, to be observed  at
an event at the Capitol in Albany on Tuesday, April 18, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honor Flights are an opportunity to recognize and thank the
Americans  who  secured  our  freedom  by  bringing them to the Nation's
capital to see the memorials that commemorate their service, giving them
a hero's welcome every step of the way; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 2005 by Jeff Miller and  Earl  Morse,  Honor
Flight  Network  is  a  national  nonprofit  organization  comprised  of
independent hubs working together to achieve the Honor  Flight  mission;
our  Nation's  meritorious veterans always travel free of charge, thanks
to generous donations to this vital non-profit organization; and
 
  WHEREAS, Participation in an Honor Flight trip  gives  veterans  the
opportunity  to  share  this  momentous  occasion  with  other comrades,
remember the fallen, and share their stories and experiences with  other
veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  Honor Flight Network commends those who served
during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War,  and  veterans  of
any service era who are critically ill; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each year, the Honor Flight Network helps make it possible
for about 22,000 veterans  to  travel  to  Washington  D.C.;  since  its
inception,  approximately  275,000  veterans from all services from more
than 130 locations across the country have taken the flight; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York State alone, more than  5,000  members  of  our
armed  services  have  fulfilled  their  wish  of  visiting our Nation's
capital and all its sites and memorials  honoring  our  country's  great
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  the  Honor  Flight  Network is in direct
correlation to the efforts of  its  Chief  Executive  Director  Meredith
Rosenbeck and her staff and volunteers, whose involvement is, and always
has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an unbridled
 
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and abroad,
these brave men and women of our military have demonstrated  their  love
for  their  country  and merit forevermore, the highest respect of their
State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's veterans deserve to be  recognized,  commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 1st Annual Honor Flight Day in the State  of  New  York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Meredith Rosenbeck, Chief Executive Officer, Honor Flight
Network.
