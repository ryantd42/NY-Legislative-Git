 AN  ACT to authorize the town of Seneca Falls to offer an optional twen-
  ty-year retirement plan to a certain formerly employed police officer
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Jamie  Buffone, a member of the New York state and local police and fire
 retirement system, who is currently employed by the city of Ithaca,  who
 was employed as a police officer with the village of Seneca Falls, which
 merged  into the town of Seneca Falls subsequent to her employment, from
 August 5, 2002 through October 11, 2005, and who, through  no  fault  of
 her  own,  failed  to  file  a  timely application to participate in the
 special twenty-year retirement plan contained in section  384-d  of  the
 retirement  and  social  security  law resulting in the crediting of her
 service with the former village of Seneca Falls in the  retirement  plan
 contained  in  section  375-i of such law, shall be given full credit in
 the special twenty-year retirement plan contained in  section  384-d  of
 the  retirement  and  social  security  law  for  such  service upon the
 election of the town of Seneca Falls to assume the  additional  cost  of
 such  service.  The town of Seneca Falls may so elect by filing with the
 state comptroller, no later than one year from  the  effective  date  of
 this  act,  a  resolution  of  its  local legislative body together with
 certification that such police officer did not bar herself from  partic-
 ipation in such retirement plan as a result of her own negligence. Ther-
 eafter, such police officer may elect to be covered by the provisions of
 section  384-d  of  the retirement and social security law, and shall be

 entitled to the full rights and benefits associated with coverage  under
 such  section,  by  filing a request to that effect with the state comp-
 troller no later than one year from the effective date of this act.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the town of Seneca Falls.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would grant Jamie Buffone, a Tier 2 member of the New York
 State and Local Police and Fire Retirement  System,  additional  service
 creditable  under  the provisions of section 384-d of the Retirement and
 Social Security Law (RSSL) for time worked as a police officer  for  the
 Village  of  Seneca  Falls,  which merged into the Town of Seneca Falls.
 Such service is currently creditable in the age-55  retirement  plan  of
 section  375-i of the RSSL but not in the 20-year plan of section 384-d.
 Jamie Buffone is currently employed by the City of Ithaca.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  legislative  session,  there
 will  be  an immediate past service cost of approximately $108,000 which
 will be borne by the Town of Seneca Falls as a  one-time  payment.  This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 City of Ithaca.
