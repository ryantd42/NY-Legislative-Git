 TEXT  BALLOT  PROPOSAL OF UP TO THIRTY WORDS, WRITTEN IN PLAIN LANGUAGE,
 THAT DESCRIBES THE CHANGE IN POLICY TO BE  ADOPTED  AND  NOT  THE  LEGAL
 MECHANISM;  AND  C.  A STATEMENT OF WHAT A YES OR NO VOTE MEANS IN UP TO
 THIRTY  WORDS  WRITTEN  IN  PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT IDENTIFIES THE PRACTICAL
 OUTCOME OF EACH ELECTION RESULT AND NOT THE  LEGAL  MECHANISM.  If  more

 such election, each such amendment, proposition or question respectively
 shall be separately and consecutively numbered.
  3. The attorney general shall  advise  in  the  preparation  of  [such

 BOARD  OF ELECTIONS SHALL STATE THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION THAT THE
 PLAIN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION ARE MET.

 FORM OF THE BALLOT PROPOSAL AND ABSTRACT:

 SECTION, THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL CALCULATE AN AUTOMATED READ-
 ABILITY INDEX SCORE, SEPARATELY,  FOR  EACH  STATEWIDE  FORM  OF  BALLOT
 PROPOSAL AND ABSTRACT.
  THE  AUTOMATED  READABILITY INDEX SCORE SHALL BE CALCULATED ACCORDING
 TO THE FOLLOWING FORMULA:
  A. DIVIDE THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS (EXCLUDING SPACES) BY THE NUMBER OF
 WORDS AND MULTIPLY THAT NUMBER BY 4.71;
  B. DIVIDE THE NUMBER OF WORDS BY THE NUMBER OF SENTENCES AND  MULTIPLY
 THAT NUMBER BY 0.5;
  C. ADD THE RESULTS OF PARAGRAPHS A AND B OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  D. SUBTRACT 21.43 FROM THE RESULT OF PARAGRAPH C OF THIS PARAGRAPH AND
 ROUND TO THE NEAREST WHOLE NUMBER.
  7.  NO  SPECIFIC  AUTOMATED READABILITY INDEX SCORE SHALL BE REQUIRED;
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE BOARD SHALL USE  BEST  EFFORTS  TO  SCORE  AT  AN
 EIGHTH  GRADE  READING  LEVEL  OR BELOW AND MEET THE DEFINITION OF PLAIN
 LANGUAGE IN SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION.  IN  ADDITION,  THE  BOARD
 SHALL  EXPEND THEIR BEST EFFORTS NOT TO EXCEED THE WORD LIMITS IN SUBDI-
