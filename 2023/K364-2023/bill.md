  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 30, 2023, as Therapy Animal Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  appreciate  the  service,
companionship,  loyalty,  and medical benefits therapeutic animals bring
to the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 30, 2023, as Therapy
Animal Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance
of National Therapy Animal Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Therapy Animal Day was created by Pet Partners to
recognize all of the exceptional therapy animals who partner with  their
human companions to bring comfort and healing to those in need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Therapy  animals  and  their handlers can be found helping
people of all  ages  in  a  variety  of  settings  including  hospitals,
pediatric  care  units,  schools,  nursing  homes  and  assisted  living
facilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, With  a  goal  to  recognize  and  honor  therapy  animals,
National  Therapy  Animal  Day  also  raises  awareness and educates the
public about the role therapy animals play in enhancing the  health  and
well-being of humans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, this vital commemoration honors the thousands
of dedicated handlers who volunteer their  time  and  compassion  during
visits; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  primary  purpose  of  therapy  animals  is to provide
affection and comfort; these kind and  compassionate  animals  are  most
often  privately  owned and tend to visit facilities on a regular basis;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dedicated  to  helping  people  with  a  wide  variety  of
problems,  therapy animals can be classified into three different types:
Therapeutic Visitation Animals are household  pets  whose  owners  bring
them to care facilities; Animal Assisted Therapy Animals assist physical
and  occupational  therapists  at  rehabilitation  centers; and Facility
Therapy Animals primarily work in  nursing  homes  for  the  purpose  of
helping patients with Alzheimer's disease and mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Visits  by  therapy  animals  in an outpatient setting can
provide many patients with significant reductions in pain and  emotional
distress;  these visits have also been proven to give family members and
friends of patients a sense of comfort and well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, therapy animals have helped numerous war-time
veterans in making the difficult transition from bravely serving in  our
military to returning to life in the civilian world; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
extraordinary  therapy  animals  and  their  handlers  who  demonstrate
tremendous care and compassion by bringing comfort and healing to  those
in need; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 30, 2023, as Therapy
Animal Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
