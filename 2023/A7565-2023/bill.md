  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Section 404-p of the vehicle and traffic law, as  added  by

 of the laws of 2001, is amended to read as follows:
  § 404-p. Distinctive plates for [congressional] medal of honor recipi-
 ents.  1.  Any [congressional] medal of honor recipient residing in this
 state shall, upon request, be issued a license plate bearing  the  words
 "[congressional]  medal  of  honor".  Application for said license plate
 shall be filed with the commissioner in such  form  and  detail  as  the
 commissioner shall prescribe.
  2. The distinctive plate authorized herein shall be issued upon proof,
 satisfactory  to the commissioner, that the applicant is a [congression-
 al] medal of honor recipient.
  3. A distinctive plate issued pursuant to this section shall be issued
 in the same manner as other number plates, provided,  however,  that  no
 registration fee or service charge shall be charged for such plate.
  §  2. Distinctive plates issued pursuant to section 404-p of the vehi-
 cle and traffic law prior to the  amendment  of  such  section  made  by
 section  one  of  this act shall be reissued to any person assigned such
 plate upon such person's request. No fee  or  service  charge  shall  be
 charged  for  the  reissuance  of  such  plate.  Provided, however, that
 notwithstanding the provisions of  section  one  of  this  act,  nothing
 contained in this act shall be deemed to invalidate "Congressional Medal
 of  Honor" distinctive license plates issued prior to the effective date
 of this act.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
