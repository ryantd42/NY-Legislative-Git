 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be

 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or  property,  or  any  charge  of  criminal  possession of a firearm as

 released  on  his or her own recognizance or under appropriate non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]

 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable

 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
