  A  reporting  individual  need not disclose activities performed while
 lawfully acting in his or her capacity as provided  in  paragraphs  (c),
 (d),  (e)  and (f) of subdivision seven of section seventy-three of this
 article.
 The disclosure requirement  in  questions  (b-1)  and  (b-2)  shall  not
 require  disclosing  clients  or customers receiving medical, pharmaceu-
 tical or dental services, mental health services,  or  residential  real
 estate  brokering  services  from the reporting individual or his or her
 firm or if federal law prohibits or  limits  disclosure.  The  reporting
 individual  need not identify any client to whom he or she or his or her
 firm provided legal representation  with  respect  to  investigation  or
 prosecution  by  law  enforcement authorities, bankruptcy, family court,
 estate planning, or domestic relations matters, nor shall the  reporting
 individual  identify  individuals  represented  pursuant to an insurance
 policy but the reporting individual shall  in  such  circumstances  only
 report  the  entity that provides compensation to the reporting individ-
 ual; with respect to matters in which the client's name is  required  by
 law  to  be  kept  confidential  (such as matters governed by the family
 court act) or in matters in which the reporting individual represents or
 provides services to minors, the client's  name  may  be  replaced  with
 initials.  To  the  extent  that the reporting individual, or his or her
 firm, provided legal representation with respect to  an  initial  public
 offering,  and  professional  disciplinary  rules,  federal law or regu-
 lations restrict the disclosure of information relating  to  such  work,
 the  reporting  individual shall (i) disclose the identity of the client
 and the services provided relating to the initial public offering to the
 office of court  administration,  who  will  maintain  such  information
 confidentially  in a locked box; and (ii) include in his or her response
 to questions (b-1) and (b-2) that pursuant to this paragraph, a  disclo-
 sure to the office of court administration has been made. Upon such time
 that  the  disclosure  of information maintained in the locked box is no
 longer restricted by professional disciplinary  rules,  federal  law  or
 regulation,  the reporting individual shall disclose such information in
 an amended disclosure statement in response to the  disclosure  require-
 ments  in  questions (b-1) and (b-2). The office of court administration
 shall develop and maintain a secure  portal  through  which  information
 submitted  to  it pursuant to this paragraph can be safely and confiden-
 tially stored. With respect to clients represented in other matters  not
 otherwise  exempt,  the reporting individual may request an exemption to
 S. 3544  9
 
 publicly disclosing the name of  that  client  from  the  commission  on
 ethics and lobbying in government pursuant to section ninety-four of the
 executive  law,  or  from  the  office  of court administration. In such
 application,  the  reporting  individual  shall state the following: "My
 client is not currently receiving my services or seeking my services  in
 connection with:
  (i) A proposed bill or resolution in the senate or assembly during the
 reporting period;
  (ii)  A  contract in an amount totaling $10,000 or more from the state
 or any state agency for services, materials, or property;
  (iii) A grant of $10,000 or more from the state or  any  state  agency
 during the reporting period;
  (iv)  A  grant  obtained  through  a legislative initiative during the
 reporting period; or
  (v) A case, proceeding, application or other  matter  that  is  not  a
 ministerial matter before a state agency during the reporting period."
  In  reviewing  the  request for an exemption, the commission on ethics
 and lobbying in government or the office  of  court  administration  may
 consult  with bar or other professional associations and the legislative
 ethics commission for individuals subject to its  jurisdiction  and  may
 consider the rules of professional conduct. In making its determination,
 the  commission  on  ethics  and lobbying in government or the office of
 court administration shall conduct its own inquiry  and  shall  consider
 factors  including,  but  not limited to: (i) the nature and the size of
 the client; (ii) whether the client has any business before  the  state;
 and  if  so, how significant the business is; and whether the client has
 any particularized interest in pending legislation and if so how signif-
 icant the  interest  is;  (iii)  whether  disclosure  may  reveal  trade
 secrets;  (iv) whether disclosure could reasonably result in retaliation
 against the client; (v) whether disclosure may cause undue harm  to  the
 client;  (vi)  whether disclosure may result in undue harm to the attor-
 ney-client relationship; and (vii) whether disclosure may result  in  an
 unnecessary invasion of privacy to the client.
  The  commission  on  ethics and lobbying in government or, as the case
 may be, the office of court administration shall promptly make  a  final
 determination in response to such request, which shall include an expla-
 nation  for its determination.  The office of court administration shall
 issue its  final  determination  within  three  days  of  receiving  the
 request.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any professional
 disciplinary rule to the contrary, the disclosure of the identity of any
 client or customer in response to this  question  shall  not  constitute
 professional misconduct or a ground for disciplinary action of any kind,
 or  form the basis for any civil or criminal cause of action or proceed-
 ing. A reporting individual who first enters public office after January
 first, two thousand sixteen, need not report clients or  customers  with
 respect to matters for which the reporting individual or his or her firm
 was retained prior to entering public office.
  (c)  APPLICABLE ONLY TO NEW CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS FOR WHOM SERVICES ARE
 PROVIDED ON OR AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN, OR FOR
 NEW MATTERS FOR EXISTING CLIENTS OR  CUSTOMERS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  THOSE
 SERVICES  THAT ARE PROVIDED ON OR AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOU-
 SAND FIFTEEN:
  If the reporting individual receives income of ten thousand dollars or
 greater from any employment or activity reportable under question  8(a),
 identify  each  registered  lobbyist  who  has directly referred to such
 individual a client who was successfully referred to the reporting indi-
 S. 3544  10
 
 vidual's business  and  from  whom  the  reporting  individual  or  firm
 received  a  fee for services in excess of five thousand dollars. Report
 only those referrals that were made to a reporting individual by  direct
 communication  from  a person known to such reporting individual to be a
 registered lobbyist at the time the referral is made.  With  respect  to
 each  such referral, the reporting individual shall identify the client,
 the registered lobbyist who has made the referral, the category of value
 of the compensation received and a general description of  the  type  of
 matter  so referred. A reporting individual need not disclose activities
 performed while lawfully acting pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and
 (f) of subdivision seven of section seventy-three of this  article.  The
 disclosure  requirements  in  this question shall not require disclosing
 clients  or  customers  receiving  medical,  pharmaceutical  or  dental
 services,  mental  health services, or residential real estate brokering
 services from the reporting individual or his or her firm or if  federal
 law  prohibits  or  limits disclosure. The reporting individual need not
 identify any client to whom he or she or his or her firm provided  legal
 representation  with  respect  to  investigation  or  prosecution by law
 enforcement authorities, bankruptcy, family court, estate  planning,  or
 domestic  relations matters, nor shall the reporting individual identify
 individuals represented pursuant to an insurance policy but the  report-
 ing  individual  shall in such circumstances only report the entity that
 provides compensation to  the  reporting  individual;  with  respect  to
 matters  in which the client's name is required by law to be kept confi-
 dential (such as matters governed by the family court act) or in matters
 in which the reporting individual represents  or  provides  services  to
 minors,  the  client's name may be replaced with initials. To the extent
 that the reporting individual, or his or her firm, provided legal repre-
 sentation with respect to an initial public offering, and federal law or
 regulations restricts the disclosure of  information  relating  to  such
 work,  the  reporting  individual shall (i) disclose the identity of the
 client and the services provided relating to the initial public offering
 to the office of court administration, who will maintain  such  informa-
 tion  confidentially  in  a  locked  box; and (ii) include in his or her
 response a statement that pursuant to this paragraph,  a  disclosure  to
 the  office  of  court administration has been made. Upon such time that
 the disclosure of information maintained in the locked box is no  longer
 restricted  by federal law or regulation, the reporting individual shall
 disclose such information in an amended disclosure statement in response
 to the disclosure requirements of this paragraph.  The office  of  court
 administration  shall develop and maintain a secure portal through which
 information submitted to it pursuant to this paragraph can be safely and
 confidentially stored. With respect  to  clients  represented  in  other
 matters  not  otherwise  exempt, the reporting individual may request an
 exemption to publicly disclosing  the  name  of  that  client  from  the
 commission  on  ethics  and  lobbying  in government pursuant to section
 ninety-four of the executive law, or from the office of  court  adminis-
 tration.  In  such application, the reporting individual shall state the
 following: "My client is not currently receiving my services or  seeking
 my services in connection with:
  (i) A proposed bill or resolution in the senate or assembly during the
 reporting period;
  (ii)  A  contract in an amount totaling $10,000 or more from the state
 or any state agency for services, materials, or property;

  (iv)  A  grant  obtained  through  a legislative initiative during the
 reporting period; or
  (v)  A  case,  proceeding,  application  or other matter that is not a

  In reviewing the request for an exemption, the  commission  on  ethics
 and  lobbying  in  government  or the office of court administration may
 consult with bar or other professional associations and the  legislative
 ethics  commission  for  individuals subject to its jurisdiction and may
 consider the rules of professional conduct. In making its determination,
 the commission on ethics and lobbying in government  or  the  office  of
 court  administration  shall  conduct its own inquiry and shall consider
 factors including, but not limited to: (i) the nature and  the  size  of
 the  client;  (ii) whether the client has any business before the state;
 and if so, how significant the business is; and whether the  client  has
 any particularized interest in pending legislation and if so how signif-
 icant  the  interest  is;  (iii)  whether  disclosure  may  reveal trade
 secrets; (iv) whether disclosure could reasonably result in  retaliation
 against  the  client; (v) whether disclosure may cause undue harm to the
 client; (vi) whether disclosure may result in undue harm to  the  attor-
 ney-client  relationship;  and (vii) whether disclosure may result in an
 unnecessary invasion of privacy to the client.
  The commission on ethics and lobbying in government or,  as  the  case
 may  be,  the office of court administration shall promptly make a final
 determination in response to such request, which shall include an expla-
 nation for its determination.  The office of court administration  shall
 issue  its  final  determination  within  three  days  of  receiving the
 request. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any  professional
 disciplinary rule to the contrary, the disclosure of the identity of any
 client  or  customer  in  response to this question shall not constitute
 professional misconduct or a ground for disciplinary action of any kind,
 or form the basis for any civil or criminal cause of action or  proceed-
 ing.  A reporting individual who first enters public office after Decem-
 ber thirty-first, two thousand  fifteen,  need  not  report  clients  or
 customers  with respect to matters for which the reporting individual or
 his or her firm was retained prior to entering public office.
