 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to offenses  for
  which  a  court  may  fix bail or commit a principal to custody of the
  sheriff

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 and subdivision 3 of
 section  510.10  of the criminal procedure law, the opening paragraph of
 subdivision 1 as amended by section 1 of subpart C of part UU of section
 56 of the laws of 2022 and subdivision 3 as added by section 2  of  part
 JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  When  a  principal, whose future court attendance at a criminal action
 or proceeding is or may be required, comes under the control of a court,
 such court shall, in accordance with this title,  by  a  securing  order
 release  the  principal on the principal's own recognizance, release the
 principal under non-monetary conditions, or, where authorized, fix  bail
 or  commit  the  principal  to  the  custody of the sheriff. In all such
 cases, except where another type  of  securing  order  is  shown  to  be
 required  by law, the court shall release the principal pending trial on
 the principal's own recognizance, unless  it  is  demonstrated  and  the
 court  makes an individualized determination that: the principal poses a
 risk of flight to avoid prosecution; OR  THAT  THE  PRINCIPAL  HAS  BEEN
 DESIGNATED  A SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW. If
 such a finding is made, the court  must  select  the  least  restrictive
 alternative  and condition or conditions that will reasonably assure the
 principal's return to court.  The court shall  explain  its  choice  of
 release,  release  with  conditions,  bail or remand on the record or in
 writing. In making its determination, the court must consider  and  take
 into account available information about the principal, including:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  3.  In  cases  other  than  as  described  in subdivision four of this
 section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-
 cipal's own recognizance, unless the court finds on  the  record  or  in
 writing  that:  (A) release on the principal's own recognizance will not
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court; OR (B) THAT THE PRIN-
 CIPAL  HAS  BEEN  DESIGNATED  A  SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE
 CORRECTION LAW. In such instances, the court shall release the principal
 under non-monetary conditions, selecting the least restrictive  alterna-
 tive  and  conditions that will reasonably assure the principal's return
 to court; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, WHERE THE PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN  DESIGNATED  A
 SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW, THE COURT MAY IN
 ITS  DISCRETION  FIX  BAIL OR COMMIT THE PRINCIPAL TO THE CUSTODY OF THE
 SHERIFF. The court shall explain its [choice  of  alternative]  DETERMI-
 NATION and conditions on the record or in writing.
  §  2.  The  opening  paragraph  of  paragraph  (a) of subdivision 1 of
 section 530.20 of the criminal procedure law, as amended by section 3 of
 subpart C of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  In  cases other than as described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision
 the court shall release the principal pending trial on  the  principal's
 own  recognizance,  unless  the  court finds on the record or in writing
 that: release on the principal's own recognizance  will  not  reasonably
 assure  the  principal's return to court; OR THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN
 DESIGNATED A SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW.  In
 such instances, the court shall release the principal under non-monetary
 conditions,  selecting  the least restrictive alternative and conditions
 that will reasonably assure the principal's return to  court;  PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER,  WHERE  THE  PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A SEX OFFENDER UNDER
 ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW, THE COURT MAY IN ITS DISCRETION FIX
 BAIL OR COMMIT THE PRINCIPAL TO THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF.  The  court
 shall  explain  its [choice of alternative] DETERMINATION and conditions
 on the record or in writing. In making its determination, the court must
 consider and take into account available information about  the  princi-
 pal, including:
  §  3.  The opening paragraph of subdivision 3 of section 530.40 of the
 criminal procedure law, as amended by section 3 of subpart B of part  UU
 of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  In  cases  other than as described in subdivision four of this section
 the court shall release the principal pending trial on  the  principal's
 own  recognizance,  unless  the  court finds on the record or in writing
 that: release on the principal's own recognizance  will  not  reasonably
 assure  the  principal's return to court; OR THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN
 DESIGNATED A SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW.  In
 such instances, the court shall release the principal under non-monetary
 conditions,  selecting  the least restrictive alternative and conditions
 that will reasonably assure the principal's return  to  court;  HOWEVER,
 WHERE  THE  PRINCIPAL  HAS  BEEN DESIGNATED A SEX OFFENDER UNDER ARTICLE
 SIX-C OF THE CORRECTION LAW, THE COURT MAY IN ITS DISCRETION FIX BAIL OR
 COMMIT THE PRINCIPAL TO THE CUSTODY OF  THE  SHERIFF.  The  court  shall
 explain  its [choice of alternative] DETERMINATION and conditions on the
 record or in writing.  In  making  its  determination,  the  court  must
 consider  and  take into account available information about the princi-
 pal, including:
