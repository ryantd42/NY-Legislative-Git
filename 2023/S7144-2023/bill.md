 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation  to  integrated  pest
  management requirements for hospitals
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public health law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 2803-zz to read as follows:
  §  2803-ZZ. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR HOSPITALS.  1.
 FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS ARE DEFINED:
  (A) "INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT" MEANS A DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS  FOR
 PEST  CONTROL  THAT UTILIZES REGULAR MONITORING TO DETERMINE IF AND WHEN
 CONTROLS ARE NEEDED; EMPLOYS PHYSICAL, MECHANICAL, CULTURAL,  BIOLOGICAL
 AND EDUCATIONAL TACTICS TO CONTROL CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE PEST INFESTA-
 TIONS  AND  TO  KEEP  PEST  POPULATIONS AT TOLERABLE DAMAGE OR ANNOYANCE
 LEVELS; AND ONLY  AS  A  LAST  RESORT,  UTILIZES  LEAST-TOXIC  PESTICIDE
 CONTROLS.  THE OVERALL GOALS OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT ARE TO ELIMI-
 NATE THE UNNECESSARY USE OF PESTICIDES AND REDUCE THE USE OF ALL  PESTI-
 CIDES.
  (B) "FACILITIES" MEANS HOSPITAL BUILDINGS, LAND AND OTHER APPURTENANC-
 ES.
  2.  TO  ENSURE  THAT  HOSPITALS  ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS FOR
 PATIENTS, VISITORS AND  HOSPITAL  STAFF  MEMBERS,  CERTAIN  REQUIREMENTS
 SHALL BE PLACED ON PESTICIDE USE IN HOSPITAL FACILITIES.
  (A)  EACH  HOSPITAL  SHALL  HAVE  A  PEST MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ALL PEST
 CONTROL ACTIVITIES. SUCH PLAN SHALL UTILIZE INTEGRATED  PEST  MANAGEMENT
 TECHNIQUES  TO  MANAGE  AND  CONTROL PESTS AND PROBLEMS. EACH INTEGRATED
 PEST MANAGEMENT PLAN SHALL INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR PUBLIC ACCESS TO  ALL
 INFORMATION  ABOUT  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN. HOSPITALS MAY ESTAB-
 LISH ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED PEST
 MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  SUCH  PLANS.  NO
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 THE  DEPARTMENT. EVERY HOSPITAL SHALL UPDATE ITS INTEGRATED PEST MANAGE-
 MENT PLAN AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.
  (C) EVERY PESTICIDE  APPLICATION  AT  A  HOSPITAL  FACILITY  SHALL  BE
 CONDUCTED BY A CERTIFIED COMMERCIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATOR. NO SUCH APPLI-

 FIED COMMERCIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATOR.
  (D)  A  NOTICE  OF  PESTICIDE  APPLICATION AND A COPY OF THE PESTICIDE

 HOSPITAL  EMPLOYEE OR CONTACT PERSON WHO SHALL PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMA-
 TION ON THE PESTICIDE APPLICATION. A COPY OF THE PESTICIDE  LABEL  SHALL
 BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY PERSON REQUESTING SUCH LABEL WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR
 HOURS OF SUCH REQUEST.
