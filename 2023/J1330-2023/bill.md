  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary of the John
  McLane Hose Company
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proud  to  commemorate  the  100th
Anniversary  of  the  John McLane Hose Company and to honor its past and
present members for a century of fire protection and emergency  response
to  the  citizens of the Hamlet of Rexford, New York and its surrounding
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fire companies are an integral part of community protection
services in every locality of our State; during the past 100 years,  the
courageous and devoted firefighters of the John McLane Hose Company have
valiantly  responded to all types of emergencies and have won the praise
and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Rexford Fire District is located at the western end  of
the Town of Clifton Park and the south-western corner of Saratoga County
in  New  York  State,  and the District is managed by a board of elected
commissioners and is responsible for the  fire  protection  and  medical
first response of approximately 800 homes in the Hamlet of Rexford; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters serve without pay, devote hundreds
of hours of time away from family, and in many cases;  spend  their  own
money  on  firefighting gear and bear the responsibility for recruitment
and retention to maintain organizational stability; and
 
  WHEREAS, Soon after the burning of a cement shed in  the  spring  of
1923, a meeting was held by several residents of Rexford for the purpose
of  determining  what  could  be  done to protect life and property from
damaging fires; and
 
  WHEREAS, Those attending this meeting were  Michael  Travis,  Joseph
Mahar,  Fred Bennett, William Drumm, John McLane, Jr., Edmund Hinchcliff
and Homer Tracey; and
 
  WHEREAS, The resulting conclusions of the meeting  were  that  if  a
small  shed  or  shanty  were to be built near the church, to house fire
extinguishers and pails, the residents  of  the  village  would  have  a
common place suitable for obtaining firefighting equipment, and further;
the church bell would be used for a fire alarm; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  current  leadership  of  Company  President Al
Craver, and Chief Aaron Cote, the John McLane Hose Company has  held  up
the  high standards of ensuring public safety which has been a staple of
this company since its inception; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by individual firefighters and emergency personnel, the John McLane Hose
Company  reflects  on their rich history and development of firefighting
over the past 100 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
 
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving, especially in a volunteer capacity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the  volunteer  fire  companies  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the  100th  Anniversary  of  the  John  McLane  Hose
Company; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a copies of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ranking members of the John McLane Hose Company.
