 fied in this article, provided, however, that administrative matters  of
 general  applicability  within the department shall be applicable to the
 board. Such board shall  consist  of  not  more  than  nineteen  members
 appointed  by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. OF

 than  by  expiration of term shall be appointed for the remainder of the
 unexpired term of the member whom he OR SHE is to succeed. In the  event
 of  the  inability  to  act of any member, the governor may appoint some
 competent informed person to act in his OR HER stead during the  contin-
 uance  of such disability; PROVIDED THAT ANY PERSON APPOINTED TO REPLACE

 AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS FORMERLY INCARCERATED SHALL HAVE  THE  SAME  BACK-

 additional persons to the state board of parole if the  board  currently
 includes  a member who is a current or former member of law enforcement,
 a member who is a past victim of a crime  or  the  representative  of  a
 victim  of  a past crime, and/or a member who was formerly incarcerated;
 provided that in the event of a vacancy by any such person  or  persons,
 new  members  of  similar  background  shall be appointed to replace the
 departing members.

 appointment  or reappointment of members of the state board of parole on
