 or  (C)  AFTER  AN ORAL FLUID TEST INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF CANNABIS IN

 having  thereafter  been  requested  to submit to such chemical test and
 having been informed that the person's license or permit  to  drive  and

 whether or not the person is found guilty of the charge for  which  such
 person  is arrested or detained, refuses to submit to such chemical test
 or any portion thereof, unless a court order has been  granted  pursuant
 to  subdivision three of this section, the test shall not be given and a
 written report of such refusal shall be immediately made by  the  police
 officer  before  whom such refusal was made. Such report may be verified
 by having the report sworn to, or by affixing  to  such  report  a  form
 notice  that  false  statements made therein are punishable as a class A

 of  the date of receipt of such waiver in accordance with the provisions
 of paragraph (d) of this subdivision.
