  HONORING  McCall  Wines  upon  the occasion of its
  designation as a Gold Medalist by the New York  Wine
  and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
McCall  Wines upon the occasion of its designation as a Gold Medalist by
the New York Wine and Grape Foundation at its 36th Annual New York  Wine
Classic on Tuesday, July 12, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  36th  Annual  New  York  Wine Classic is a nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years  and
allowing  wine  enthusiasts  to  enjoy  this unique part of the New York
experience across the  state,  this  extraordinary  vineyard  has  truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  McCall  Wines  was  awarded  for  its 2014 Corchaug Estate
Reserve, Pinot Noir, Best Pinot Noir; and its 2014 North Ridge Vineyards
Reserve, Cabernet Franc; and
 
  WHEREAS, Until roughly 300 years ago, Downs Woods and  the  adjacent
McCall  vineyards were the cultural center of an Algonquin Indian tribe;
known as Fort  Corchaug,  the  natives  selected  this  unique  maritime
property along the estuary as their home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1902,  Russell  Simeon  Walker,  President of the Dime
Savings Bank in Brooklyn, rode his horse and buggy to the North Fork  to
find  a  summer  home;  from  the Walkers to the Munkenbecks down to the
McCalls, the property remained in the family; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1996, Russell McCall joined forces with the Peconic Land
Trust to save Down's Woods, Fort Corchaug, and the farmland adjacent  to
his  family's  property  from  the threat of development, after which he
replanted the corn and potato fields with 21 acres of vineyards;  a  few
years  later,  he purchased and gifted the North Fork Stewardship Center
to the Peconic Land Trust in allegiance to their shared commitment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 2007, McCall Wines made its  first  vintage  the
same  year  before  opening its tasting room, erecting its wind turbine,
and raising cattle in 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  2011,  McCall  Wines  acquired  North  Ridge  Vineyard,
expanding  its  production  of  estate-grown  wines  with  this old-vine
planting; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of McCall Wines is in direct correlation to the
efforts  of  its  dedicated  owners and staff, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors  on  behalf  of the businesses and the communities they serve;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community,  fully confident it will continue to enjoy the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  McCall  Wines  upon  the  occasion  of  its designation as a Gold
Medalist by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to McCall Wines.
