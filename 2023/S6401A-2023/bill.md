  § 5. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, none of the
 provisions of this act shall be subject to the appropriation requirement
 of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  § 6. All past service costs incurred with implementing the  provisions
 of  this  act  shall  be  borne by any county that elects to provide the
 benefits provided by this act.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow county employers to elect to provide  correction
 officers  with  an increased limit on the overtime compensation included
 in the final average salary calculation beginning January 1,  2025.  The
 improved  limit  would  be thirty percent of a member's annual wages, if
 greater than the limit. Current limits were set at $15,000 at the incep-
 tion of each tier, with the Tier 5 limit increasing 3% annually and  the
 Tier 6 limit increasing annually with inflation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that there will be an increase in the annual contributions of any
 electing county of 0.4% of affected correction officers' salary for Tier
 5 and 1.0% of affected correction officers' salary for Tier  6  for  the
 fiscal  year ending March 31, 2025. In future years, this cost will vary
 as the billing rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate  past  service  cost  of  approximately  5.4%  of  affected
 correction  officers' salary, which will be borne by any electing county
 as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that payment will  be  made
 on February 1, 2025.
  Further,  we  anticipate  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Prior to electing to provide these benefits, an eligible county would be
 required to submit a roster of individuals in covered titles to the  New
 York  State  and  Local  Retirement System. This roster would be used to
 develop an exact cost for the  individual  county  electing  to  provide
 these benefits.
