 TION THAT IT HAS COVERED THE DRUG FOR THE ENROLLEE WITHIN THE PAST THREE
 HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE DAYS;
  (V)  REQUIRE  A  NEWLY  ENROLLED  INSURED TO REPEAT STEP THERAPY FOR A
 PRESCRIBED DRUG WHERE THAT INSURED ALREADY COMPLETED  STEP  THERAPY  FOR
 THAT  DRUG  UNDER  A  PRIOR  PLAN,  SO  LONG AS THE ENROLLEE OR PROVIDER
 SUBMITS INFORMATION DEMONSTRATING COMPLETION OF A STEP THERAPY  PROTOCOL
 OF THE PRIOR PLAN WITHIN THE PAST THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE DAYS; AND
  (VI) BE IMPOSED ON AN INSURED FOR A PRESCRIBED DRUG THAT WAS PREVIOUS-
 LY  APPROVED  FOR  COVERAGE  BY  A PLAN FOR A SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITION
 AFTER THE INSURED'S PLAN IMPLEMENTS A FORMULARY  CHANGE  OR  UTILIZATION
 MANAGEMENT  THAT  IMPACTS  THE COVERAGE CRITERIA FOR THE PRESCRIBED DRUG
 UNTIL THE APPROVED OVERRIDE EXPIRES, UNLESS  A  SPECIFICALLY  IDENTIFIED
 AND  CURRENT EVIDENCE-BASED SAFETY CONCERN EXISTS AND A DIFFERENT THERA-
 PEUTIC ALTERNATIVE DRUG EXISTS.
  (16) WHEN ESTABLISHING A STEP THERAPY PROTOCOL, A  UTILIZATION  REVIEW
 AGENT  SHALL  ENSURE THAT THE PROTOCOL ACCEPTS ANY WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC
 ATTESTATION SUBMITTED BY  THE  INSURED'S  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONAL  AS
 DEFINED IN SECTION FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED OF THIS TITLE STATING THAT
 A  REQUIRED  DRUG  HAS  FAILED AS PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THAT THE REQUIRED
