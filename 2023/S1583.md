 Introduced  by  Sen.  ORTT  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Internet and Technology
 
 AN ACT to establish the internet media freedom task force; and providing
  for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative findings. The twenty-first century has seen an
 increasing reliance upon social media as a source of news  and  informa-
 tion.  Social media platforms allow third-party users to post content on
 an unlimited number of issues, and,  unfortunately,  though  not  solely
 designed  or  intended  for  such use, more and more people have come to
 rely on these third-party postings as their main source  of  news.  Some
 social  media platforms have recently taken it upon themselves to act as
 arbiters of truth, and have even gone so far as to block access  to  the
 President of the United States. Given the expanding use of, and reliance
 on,  these  social media platforms as a source of news, it is imperative
 that use of such platforms be open and  maintained  for  all  people  to
 ensure  that no perspective or piece of information is barred or blocked
 from view by the public at large who has come to rely on such  platforms
 for information.
  §  2.  Legislative task force on internet media freedom. A legislative
 task force on internet media freedom is hereby established to study  the
 practices  and policies of social media companies that allow the posting
 of third-party content by users, as well as  other  issues  relating  to
 dissemination  of  such  content, including but not limited to, forms of
 censorship employed by social media companies. The task force will  also
 examine  the impact social media has on elections, including the ability
 of candidates and political parties to access and use the  platform  and
 the use of censorship to unfairly benefit one candidate over another.
  § 3. Composition. (a) The task force shall consist of eight members to
 be  appointed  as  follows:  two members appointed by the speaker of the

 Assembly, two members  appointed  by  the  temporary  president  of  the
 Senate,  two  members  appointed by the minority leader of the Assembly,
 and two members appointed by the minority  leader  of  the  Senate.  All
 appointments made by legislative leaders to the task force shall, to the
 extent  practicable,  have  backgrounds  in  news  publishing, including
 online media publishing, and/or the study of law.
  (b) Members of the task force shall serve without compensation.
  (c) The members of the task force shall elect, by a majority vote, one
 of its appointed members to serve as a chair.
  § 4. Organization. (a) The task force shall meet for the first time on
 May 1, 2023, at which time they shall elect a member to serve as a chair
 of the task force pursuant to subdivision (c) of section three  of  this
 act.
  (b)  The  first  meeting  of the task force shall be held in the State
 Capitol, in offices  made  available  to  it  by  the  Legislature.  The
 location  of subsequent meetings shall be at the discretion of the chair
 of the task force.
  (c) The task force shall create and maintain a website  that  provides
 access  to written submissions received by it, as well as means by which
 individuals can submit testimony and view live and archived meetings and
 hearings of the task force.
  § 5. Hearings. The task force shall be authorized to hold public hear-
 ings and meetings, and to consult  with  any  organization,  educational
 institution,  or  other  government  entity  or  person, to enable it to
 accomplish its duties. The task force shall hold  at  least  two  public
 hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment.
  §  6.  Duties  and powers. (a) To effectuate the purposes of this act,
 the task force may request and shall receive from any department,  divi-
 sion,  board,  bureau,  commission  or  other agency of the state or any
 state public authority such assistance, information  and  data  as  will
 enable the task force to properly carry out its powers and duties.
  (b)  The  task  force  may  hire  any necessary staff to assist in the
 discharge of its duties, and may utilize funds appropriated  to  it  for
 necessary expenses related to the discharge of its duties.
  (c)  The  task  force shall undertake an examination of existing state
 and federal policies relating to publishing third-party content  on  the
 internet, including, but not limited to:
  (i)  use of social media platforms, including, but not limited to, who
 uses them, for what purposes are they used, and a  review  of  usage  in
 past political campaigns;
  (ii)  safeguards  that  exist to ensure accuracy of information posted
 online;
  (iii) use of censorship to restrict publication of third-party created
 content online;
  (iv) statutory protections that currently exist to  ensure  access  to
 social media platforms; and
  (v) liability shields that protect platform operators.
  §  7.  Report. The task force shall draft a final report detailing its
 findings, as well as any recommendations it has on changes to  state  or
 federal  law,  and to executive agency policies, actions, and procedures
 relating to the use of and access to social media. Such report shall  be
 completed  and  delivered  to the Governor, the speaker of the Assembly,
 the temporary president of the Senate, the minority leader of the Assem-
 bly, the minority leader of the Senate, and each member of the New  York
 State  Congressional  Delegation  on  or  before  December 31, 2024. The
 S. 1583  3
 
 report shall also be made publicly available and posted on the  websites
 of the State Assembly and Senate.
  §  8.  Dissolution.  Upon completion of a final report and delivery as
 directed by this act, the legislative task  force  shall  be  dissolved;
 provided, however, that dissolution of this task force shall occur on or
 before January 1, 2025.
  §  9.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed January 1, 2025.
