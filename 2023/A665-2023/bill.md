 CONSIDER AND RESPOND TO SUCH REQUEST PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF  THIS
 SECTION.
  B.  THE  EMPLOYER  SHALL RESPOND TO THE REQUEST FOR A FLEXIBLE WORKING
 ARRANGEMENT FROM THE EMPLOYEE, AND SHALL CONSIDER THE EMPLOYEE'S REQUEST

 ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR ITS LEGAL OR  CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.  AN
