  tion  law  and the highway law, in relation to memorializing Robert F.
  Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Pedro  Albizu  Campos  by

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 recognizes  Robert  F. Kennedy by naming after him a span of the Tribor-
 ough bridge, as a tribute befitting his  historic  contribution  to  the
 state  of  New  York  and  the nation. Robert F. Kennedy represented the
 state of New York in the United States Senate  with  great  distinction,
 from  1965  until  his  untimely  death  in  1968, working tirelessly to
 improve the lives of New Yorkers, fighting  poverty  and  advancing  the
 civil  rights movement. The state of New York and our entire nation were
 further enriched by Robert F. Kennedy's  prior  service  as  the  sixty-
 fourth Attorney General of the United States, and trusted advisor to the
 President.  Common throughout his many works was an effort to bridge the
 gaps among persons of diverse racial, ethnic and  economic  backgrounds.
 Accordingly,  the  legislature  hereby  names the span of the Triborough
 bridge which stretches over the East river from the borough of Queens to
 Ward's Island the Robert F.  Kennedy bridge.
  The legislature further recognizes Dr. Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  in
 this  fifty-fourth  year  following  his tragic assassination, by naming
 after him a span of the Triborough bridge, as a  tribute  befitting  his
 historic  contributions  to  the nation.  Dr. King worked tirelessly to
 improve the lives of the citizens of this country, fighting  segregation
 and  discrimination  through non-violent protest and advancing the civil
 rights movement, until his untimely death in 1968. The state of New York
 and our entire nation were enriched by Dr.  King's  dedication,  example

 and sacrifices. Common throughout his many works was an effort to bridge
 the  gaps  among  persons  of  diverse racial, ethnic and economic back-
 grounds. Accordingly, the legislature  hereby  names  the  span  of  the
 Triborough bridge which stretches from Randall's Island to Manhattan the
 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. bridge.
  The  legislature  also  hereby  recognizes Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, by
 naming after him a span of the Triborough bridge, as a tribute befitting
 his historic contributions to the nation  of  Puerto  Rico.  Dr.  Albizu
 Campos,  the  most  prominent  Puerto Rican political figure of the 20th
 century, was instrumental in Puerto Rico's fight for independence  until
 his death in 1965. Accordingly, the legislature hereby names the span of
 the Triborough bridge which stretches from Randall's Island to the Bronx
 the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos bridge.
