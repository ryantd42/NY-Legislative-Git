 Introduced  by Sen. HARCKHAM -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  a  marine  fisheries licensing task force; and providing
  for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative Findings. New York state's commercial fishing
 industry is an important sector of the New York state economy.  The  New
 York  state  commercial fishing industry generates more than $40 million
 in revenue. New York state is fifth in the nation in terms of  jobs  and
 sales generated by the seafood industry.
  The  contribution  of  the  commercial fishing industry to the state's
 economy has been hindered by an outdated and antiquated licensing proce-
 dure which has failed to address the current  needs  of  the  commercial
 fishing  industry.  The  current law has been extended largely unchanged
 for decades. This statute is archaic and  has  worked  to  unnecessarily
 injure  the  commercial  fishing  in New York state. It has been a major
 culprit thwarting the growth of this vital part of the  New  York  state
 economy.
  The  adverse  impact has been recognized by the department of environ-
 mental conservation. In 2017, the department requested a 3  year  exten-
 sion  of  New  York  state's limited entry, commercial fishing licensing
 law. The legislature objected to the 3 year  extension  because  of  the
 adverse  impact  the  law was having on the commercial fishing industry.
 The legislature recognized that action to reform the commercial  fishing
 licensing  statute needed to be taken with all deliberate speed.  Conse-
 quently, only a 1 year extension was granted through 2018.
  As part of the enactment of  the  1  year  extension,  the  department
 agreed to meet with the commercial fishing industry to discuss licensing

 reform.  That  meeting took place in the fall of 2017. At that time, the
 department agreed to undertake a review of the licensing law.
  In  spring  2018,  a  consultant was hired by the department to assist
 with the review. In the summer of 2018, public meetings were  held  with
 the  commercial  fishing  industry throughout the marine district to get
 the industry's input on licensing reform. In 2019 with this report still
 pending, the state legislature agreed to extend the current  law  for  2
 additional  years  through  the end of 2020, to permit the completion of
 the department's report on licensing reform. In  July  2019,  the  draft
 report  was finally issued. In August, public meetings were conducted to
 present the report.
  However, to date, no final report has been issued by  the  department.
 By  chapter  58  of  the  laws  of  2020, the current commercial fishing
 licensing statute was again extended for another year.
  It is now imperative that after  almost  four  years  of  review  that
 legislative action be taken to reform and modernize the commercial fish-
 ing licensing law with the input of the commercial fishing industry.  It
 is the purpose of this law to establish a task force from members of the
 industry under the department to finish this review and make recommenda-
 tions to the legislature for enactment.
  This  act will utilize the work already accomplished regarding commer-
 cial fishing licensing and finalize recommendations for  action  by  the
 legislature.

 section 13-0328-a to read as follows:
