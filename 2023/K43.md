Assembly Resolution No. 43
 
BY: M. of A. Manktelow
 
  COMMEMORATING the 100th Anniversary of the Trolley
  Station in Lyons, New York, on December 28, 2022
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to commend the
efforts of those  organizations  which  seek  to  bring  recognition  to
historical places within the State of New York, and in doing so, help to
ensure  that  the  complete history of our State and Nation is preserved
and shared with present generations of citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Trolley Station in  Lyons,  New
York,  which  was celebrated at an Open House on Wednesday, December 28,
2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Trolley Station, located at  1  Montezuma  Street,  was
built  as  a  combined  passenger and freight station for the Rochester,
Syracuse & Eastern Railroad (RS&E), an electric trolley car service from
Rochester to Syracuse, in December of 1922; however, the RS&E  had  been
running  through  Lyons  since 1905, when the trolley line first started
service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to the building of a  dedicated  trolley  station  in
Lyons,  the  RS&E  used a rented storefront on Williams Street (possibly
No. 30) as its passenger station; the trolley  line  predominantly  used
the old Erie Canal route from Rochester to Syracuse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  Lyons,  it snaked its way through the village, sharing
the road bed with wagons and horses; the trolley  traveled  along  Water
Street,  turning  a  sharp  corner onto William Street, and then turning
again onto Canal Street before exiting  Lyons  to  the  east;  the  RS&E
entered  the  village  of  Lyons from the west via a metal bridge, which
exists today carrying a pipeline over the barge canal; and
 
  WHEREAS, By 1909, the trolley line was completed  to  Syracuse,  and
numerous branch lines were added over time; the RS&E (and its successor,
Empire  United  Railways), ceased operation in 1930, when the system was
declared bankrupt, largely due to the advent of the automobile; and
 
  WHEREAS, The trolley drew its power from overhead  cables,  and  the
system  utilized  direct  current (dc) power which was converted to high
voltage alternating current power (ac) for efficiency in transmission to
distant places, and then was converted back to dc power; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lyons powerhouse provided power for the entire  system,
and substations located every 10 miles or so were used to convert the ac
power  back  to  dc for the trolley to use; old substations can still be
seen in Port Gibson and in Savannah, among others; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the Fall of 1922, the RS&E straightened  out  the  route
through  Lyons  by  utilizing  the  old  canal  bed,  routing new tracks
starting at Water Street, and then  curving  slightly  to  traverse  the
current  parking  lot  behind the Wayne County Social Services building,
 
crossing Montezuma  Street,  and  then  continuing  across  the  current
parking lot behind Dobbins Drugs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  that  spot,  the  RS&E  built  a new type "A" combined
passenger and freight  station,  completed  in  December  of  1922;  the
freight  portion  of the station, encompassing the current diner counter
and kitchens, was 50 feet long, while the passenger waiting area and the
ticket counter were 18.5 feet long; the windows and the large front door
are mostly original; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1922, the old canal bed and canal  basin  had  not  been
filled  in  after  the  two  disused  versions of the Erie Canal and the
enlarged Canal  were  drained;  in  order  to  fill  the  canal  bed  to
accommodate  the  new  double  track,  the  RS&E used an accumulation of
cinders from its main powerhouse; 20,000 cubic yards of fill were needed
to complete the project, of which 12,000 cubic yards were  cinders  from
the Lyons powerhouse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Trolley  House's  raised freight floor was lowered to
provide more dining space, and the ceiling was dropped  to  provide  for
modern  utilities;  the  exterior of the building is original, including
the cement "trolley stop" where the trolley would park to  dispense  its
passengers and freight; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to express its highest admiration for the Lyons Main State Program,  and
for  all of the individuals who have worked to bring proper attention to
a place and time which merits recognition in the grand panorama  of  the
history of our State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th  Anniversary  of  the  Lyons  Trolley  Station  on
December 28, 2022; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Kim Howell, Director, Lyons Main Street Program.
