 Introduced  by  Sen.  RAMOS  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, the criminal procedure
  law, the executive law, and the legislative law, in  relation  to  the
  use  in evidence of the fact of possession or presence on the premises
  of condoms and other sexual and reproductive health  devices;  and  to
  repeal  paragraph (d) of subdivision 1 of section 160.10 of the crimi-
  nal procedure law relating thereto
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Decrimi-
 nalize condoms act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that promoting
 and protecting health and respecting and  fulfilling  human  rights  are
 necessarily  linked,  and  that  health-oriented  and  rights-based  law
 enforcement efforts are central to the effective provision of government
 services for the benefit of the people of the State. Article 17, section
 3 of the New York constitution requires that the legislature protect and
 promote the health of the inhabitants of  this  state  as  a  matter  of
 public  concern.  Despite  these provisions, for purposes of prosecuting
 certain criminal, civil and administrative  offenses,  reproductive  and
 sexual  health  tools, including condoms, are currently being destroyed,
 confiscated, or used as  evidence  by  law  enforcement  officers.  This
 legislation is intended to strengthen the public health of all New York-
 ers,  including the most vulnerable, while preserving the ability of law
 enforcement to prosecute other crimes such as  felony  sexual  offenses.
 The  purpose  of this bill is to avoid the disparate impact of the prac-
 tice of citing condoms and other reproductive and sexual health tools as
 evidence upon survivors  of  trafficking  and  people  who  are  or  are
 profiled as being engaged in sex work.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
