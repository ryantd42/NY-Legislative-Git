 ized  to file an application for accidental disability retirement with a

 husband Gerald Sullivan. If this bill is enacted, and an application for
 accidental disability retirement is timely filed, the current retirement
 benefit  will be recalculated, and payment will be made to Bonnie Sulli-
 van  retroactive to June 1, 2015, the date Gerald Sullivan first retired
 with a performance of duty disability benefit pursuant to section  363-c
 of the RSSL.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, and
 Bonnie Sullivan timely files the  required  application  for  accidental
 disability  retirement,  there will be an immediate past service cost of
 approximately $233,000 which will be borne by the State of New York as a
 one-time payment. This estimate assumes that payment  will  be  made  on
 March 1, 2025.
