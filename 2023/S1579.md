  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 11 of section  400.00  of  the

 issued pursuant to section 400.01 of this article  may  be  revoked  and
 cancelled  at  any time by the licensing officer or any judge or justice
 of a court of record. A license to engage in the business of dealer  may

 be  supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Such notice shall also
