 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  accidental  disability  retirement  for  uniformed  court officers and
  peace officers employed in the unified court system

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision a of section 605-a of the retirement and social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 489 of the laws of 2008, is amended
 to read as follows:
  a. A member employed as a uniformed court officer or peace officer  in
 the  unified  court system shall be entitled to an accidental disability
 retirement allowance if, at the time application therefor is filed, such
 member is:
  1. Physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of duty as the
 natural and proximate result of an accident, not caused by  his  OR  HER
 own  willful  negligence, sustained in such service and while actually a
 member of the retirement system; and
  2. Actually in service upon which his  or  her  membership  is  based.
 However,  in  a  case where a member is discontinued from service subse-
 quent to the accident, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and provided
 that the member meets the requirements of paragraph one of this subdivi-
 sion, application may be made either (a) by a  vested  member  incapaci-
 tated  as  the  result  of  a qualifying World Trade Center condition as
 defined in section two of this chapter at any time,  or  (b)  not  later
 than two years after the member is first discontinued from service.
  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  A  MEMBER WHO IS INJURED AS THE
 RESULT OF A PHYSICAL ASSAULT BY AN ASSAILANT, SUFFERED WHILE IN  SERVICE
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY RETIREMENT UNLESS THE CONTRA-
 RY CAN BE PROVEN BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE UNDER THIS SECTION.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 S. 3492  2
 
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall be subject  to  section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow Tier 3, 4, 5 and 6 uniformed court officers and
 peace officers in the unified court system to be eligible for  an  acci-
 dental  disability  for injuries sustained in the performance of duty as
 the result of a physical assault by an assailant, unless the contrary be
 proven by competent evidence. The benefit for an  accidental  disability
 would be 75% of final average salary less worker's compensation.
  If  this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, the cost
 will depend upon the applicant's age, service,  salary,  plan,  and  any
 benefit type otherwise payable.
  Benefit without enactment:  None  Ordinary  Service

  Cost for proposed benefit:  7.5 times  3 times  0 times
