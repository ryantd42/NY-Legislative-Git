  HONORING  Wallace  Wilson III upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of the New  York  State
  High  School  Football  Coaches Association 12th Man
  Award
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
outstanding athletes who have  distinguished  themselves  through  their
exceptional performance, attaining unprecedented success and the highest
level of personal achievement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Wallace Wilson III upon the occasion of his designation as recipient  of
the  New  York  State  High School Football Coaches Association 12th Man
Award, to be celebrated at the Section XI Dinner on Friday, February  3,
2023, in Verona, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State High School Football Coaches Association
12th Man Award is given to an athlete who overcomes adversity or medical
hardship,  something  Wallace  Wilson  III  has  seen a lot of since his
freshmen year of high school; and
 
  WHEREAS, A Longwood High School football player, Wallace Wilson  III
was  diagnosed  with  Graves'  Disease,  a rare autoimmune disorder that
affects the thyroid, when he was just 14 years old after his legs  began
to  lock  up  during  a  summer  workout;  he  will be honored with this
esteemed award for his perseverance, years after  being  told  he  might
never walk again; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  this disease and his temporary paralysis, Wallace
Wilson III had to relearn how to walk as a freshman in high  school;  he
went  to rehab and pushed himself to get back to where he was, all while
trying different medications, some of which made him tired and weak;  it
was  during  this time, Wally made peace with the fact he may never play
football again; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the  next  year,  Wallace  Wilson  III  overcame  much
adversity  and  regained his ability to walk, found the right medication
to regulate his thyroid and his body, and battled back with the goal  of
playing football, the game he has played since sixth grade; and
 
  WHEREAS, During his junior year, just 18 months after not being able
to  walk,  Wallace  Wilson  III  worked  himself  back into the starting
lineup, started all eight games on the defensive side of the  ball,  and
established  himself  as one of the best linemen in Division 1 football;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, as  a  senior,  Wallace  Wilson  III  has  made  the
extraordinary  move  to  the offensive line of the ball, where he blocks
for one of the best rushing attacks in the county; a  truly  humble  and
remarkable  young  man,  he  amassed  27  pancake blocks, and is a vocal
leader on the line; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, just playing the game of  football  after  the
type  of situation Wally has gone through would be a huge accomplishment
in itself; to start and play how he has played  in  the  trenches  after
relearning to walk makes him nothing short of incredible; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wallace Wilson III committed to SUNY Cortland where he will
continue to play football and major in special education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  gifted  athlete,  Wallace  Wilson III has become a role
model in society as well as the sport of  football;  his  character  and
achievements  stand  as  a  sterling  example and inspiration to all who
would aspire to greatness; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Wallace  Wilson  III  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation as
recipient of the New York State High School Football Coaches Association
12th Man Award; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Wallace Wilson III.
