  2. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  EVERY
 AWARD,  GRANT OR OTHER BUSINESS INCENTIVE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS CHAP-
 TER SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REPAYMENT WITH INTEREST, BY THE RECIPIENT UPON A
 FINDING BY THE AWARDING  ENTITY  THAT  THE  PERSON,  FIRM,  PARTNERSHIP,

 COMPLETED THE STATED PURPOSES OR OBJECTIVES OF THE AWARD, GRANT OR OTHER

  3.  IF  THE  AWARDING  ENTITY  DETERMINES  THAT  THE RECIPIENT WHO HAS
 RECEIVED AN AWARD, GRANT OR OTHER BUSINESS INCENTIVE UNDER THIS  CHAPTER
 IS  NOT  COMPLYING WITH THE CONTRACT, AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING ENTERED
 INTO WITH THE AWARDING ENTITY, IT SHALL NOTIFY  THE  RECIPIENT  OF  SUCH
 NONCOMPLIANCE.  SUCH NOTICE SHALL STATE THAT THE RECIPIENT IS ENTITLED
 TO A HEARING AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN  THE  NONCOMPLIANCE.  IF  THE

 FACILITIES  OR  OPERATIONS AS PROMISED UNDER THE CONTRACT, AGREEMENT, OR
 UNDERSTANDING, THE RECIPIENT SHALL REFUND THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD, GRANT
 OR BUSINESS INCENTIVE AS FOLLOWS:
  (I) WHERE THE RECIPIENT HAS DEVELOPED ONE-THIRD OR LESS OF THE FACILI-

 THE  ENTITY DETERMINES TO BE A REASONABLE PROPORTION OF THE AWARD, GRANT
 OR BUSINESS INCENTIVE NOT FULFILLED.
  4. UPON A FINDING THAT THE RECIPIENT OF THE  AWARD,  GRANT,  OR  OTHER
 BUSINESS  INCENTIVE HAS NOT FULLY EXECUTED AND COMPLETED THE PURPOSES OR
 OBJECTIVES OF THE AWARD, GRANT OR BUSINESS INCENTIVE, THE AWARDING ENTI-
 TY MAY WAIVE REPAYMENT OF SUCH AWARD, GRANT  OR  BUSINESS  INCENTIVE  AS
 REQUIRED  PURSUANT  TO THIS SECTION, UPON A FINDING THAT THE FAILURE WAS
 CAUSED BY UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONTROL
 OF THE RECIPIENT PERSON,  FIRM,  PARTNERSHIP,  COMPANY,  ASSOCIATION  OR
 CORPORATION,  AND WAS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO BAD FAITH OR FRAUD. UNFORESEEN
 CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED  TO,  MARKET  CONDITIONS
 WHICH  ADVERSELY IMPACT UPON A RECIPIENT AND WHICH ARE OF SUCH MAGNITUDE

 WAS  GRANTED  OR TO ENSURE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF ITS EMPLOYEES AT SUCH
 LOCATION. NO WAIVER OF FULL REPAYMENT MAY BE PROVIDED, HOWEVER, UPON THE
 RELOCATION OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE, OR FROM THE LOCATION SUCH  RECIPI-
 S. 7291  3
 
 ENT  OCCUPIED  AT  THE  TIME  THE RECIPIENT RECEIVED THE AWARD, GRANT OR
 BUSINESS INCENTIVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE STATE. UPON  THE  DETERMI-
 NATION  OF  UNFORESEEN  CIRCUMSTANCES APPROPRIATE TO GRANT A WAIVER, THE
 REPAYMENT  OF  THE  OUTSTANDING  BALANCE OF ANY AWARD, GRANT OR BUSINESS
 INCENTIVE, OR OF ANY TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING  INTEREST  THEREON,  MAY  BE
 DEFERRED  FOR  A  PERIOD  NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF SUCH
 WAIVER, PROVIDED THAT IF AT THE END OF FIVE  YEARS  THE  CONDITIONS  FOR
 WHICH  THE WAIVER WAS GRANTED CONTINUE, THE AWARDING ENTITY MAY GRANT AN
 ADDITIONAL WAIVER.
  5. EACH ENTITY OF THE STATE WHICH ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  CHAPTER  SHALL  ESTABLISH  RULES  AND  REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE
 CONDUCT OF A HEARING AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF REPAYMENT.
  6. ANY RECIPIENT AGGRIEVED BY A DETERMINATION OF THE  AWARDING  ENTITY
 MAY  SEEK REVIEW OF SUCH DETERMINATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVENTY-EIGHT
 OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.
  7. UNLESS THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ENTITY AND THE RECIPIENT OTHERWISE
 PROVIDES FOR A PENALTY OF INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF  NON-COMPLIANCE,  FOR
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, INTEREST CHARGED IN THE REPAYMENT OF AN AWARD,
 GRANT  OR  BUSINESS INCENTIVE SHALL BE CALCULATED AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE
 UNDERPAYMENT RATE SET BY THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION AND FINANCE PURSU-
 ANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBSECTION (E) OF SECTION ONE THOUSAND  NINETY-
 SIX  OF  THE TAX LAW; AND SHALL BE CALCULATED FROM THE DATE OF DISBURSE-
 MENT OF SUCH AWARD, GRANT OR BUSINESS INCENTIVE.
  8. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT  BE  DEEMED  TO  ALTER  OR
