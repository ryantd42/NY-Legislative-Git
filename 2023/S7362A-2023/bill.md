 AN  ACT  to  amend  the general municipal law, in relation to electronic
  bidding
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general municipal law,
 as amended by section 1 of chapter 2 of the laws of 2012, is amended  to
 read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature
 or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred
 fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of
 more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase contracts
 involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be
 awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political
 subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a
 soil  conservation  district to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing
 the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section,  provided, however, that purchase contracts
 (including contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any  purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant  to  article  eight of the labor law) may be awarded on the basis of
 best value, as defined in section one hundred sixty-three of  the  state
 finance  law,  to  a responsive and responsible bidder or offerer in the
 manner provided by this section except that in a  political  subdivision
 other  than  a city with a population of one million inhabitants or more
 or any district, board or agency with jurisdiction  exclusively  therein
 the  use  of  best  value  for  awarding a purchase contract or purchase

 contracts must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a  district
 corporation,  school  district  or  board  of  cooperative  educational
 services, by rule, regulation or resolution adopted at a public meeting.
 In  any case where a responsible bidder's or responsible offerer's gross
 price is reducible by an allowance for  the  value  of  used  machinery,
 equipment,  apparatus  or  tools to be traded in by a political subdivi-
 sion, the gross price shall be reduced by the amount of such  allowance,
 for  the  purpose  of determining the best value.  In cases where two or
 more responsible bidders furnishing the required security submit identi-
 cal bids as to price, such  officer,  board  or  agency  may  award  the
 contract  to  any of such bidders. Such officer, board or agency may, in
 his or her or its discretion, reject all bids or offers and  readvertise
 for new bids or offers in the manner provided by this section. In deter-
 mining  whether  a  purchase  is an expenditure within the discretionary
 threshold amounts established by this subdivision, the officer, board or
 agency of a political subdivision  or  of  any  district  therein  shall
 consider  the  reasonably  expected aggregate amount of all purchases of
 the same commodities, services or  technology  to  be  made  within  the
 twelve-month  period  commencing  on the date of purchase.  Purchases of
 commodities, services or technology shall not  be  artificially  divided
 for the purpose of satisfying the discretionary buying thresholds estab-
 lished  by this subdivision. A change to or a renewal of a discretionary
 purchase shall not be permitted if the change or renewal would bring the
 reasonably expected aggregate  amount  of  all  purchases  of  the  same
 commodities,  services  or  technology from the same provider within the
 twelve-month period commencing on the date of the first purchase  to  an
 amount  greater  than  the  discretionary  buying  threshold amount. For
 purposes of this section, "sealed bids" and  "sealed  offers",  as  that
 term  applies  to  purchase  contracts, (including contracts for service
 work, but excluding any purchase contracts necessary for the  completion
 of  a  public works contract pursuant to article eight of the labor law)
 shall include bids and offers submitted in an electronic format  includ-
 ing submission of the statement of non-collusion required by section one
 hundred  three-d  of  this article, provided that the governing board of
 the political subdivision or district, by resolution, has authorized the
 receipt of bids and offers in  such  format.  Submission  in  electronic
 format may, for technology contracts only, be required as the sole meth-
 od  for  the submission of bids and offers. PROVIDED HOWEVER, THE APPRO-
 PRIATE OFFICER, BOARD OR AGENCY OF A  CITY  WITH  A  POPULATION  OF  ONE
 MILLION  INHABITANTS  OR  MORE,  OR  ANY  DISTRICT, BOARD OR AGENCY WITH
 JURISDICTION EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN SUCH CITY, MAY AUTHORIZE OR REQUIRE BIDS
 AND OFFERS FOR ANY CONTRACT TO BE SUBMITTED  IN  AN  ELECTRONIC  FORMAT.
 Bids  and  offers submitted in an electronic format shall be transmitted
 by bidders and offerers to the receiving device designated by the  poli-
 tical  subdivision  or  district.  Any method used to receive electronic
 bids and offers shall comply with article three of the state  technology
 law,  and any rules and regulations promulgated and guidelines developed
 thereunder and, at a minimum, must (a) document the  time  and  date  of
 receipt  of each bid and offer received electronically; (b) authenticate
 the identity of the sender; (c) ensure the security of  the  information
 transmitted;  and  (d)  ensure  the  confidentiality of the bid or offer
 until the time and date established for the opening of bids  or  offers.
 The  timely  submission of an electronic bid or offer in compliance with
 instructions provided for such submission in the advertisement for  bids
 or  offers  and/or the specifications shall be the responsibility solely
 of each bidder or offerer or prospective bidder or offerer. No political
 S. 7362--A  3
 
 subdivision or district therein shall incur any liability from delays of
 or interruptions in the receiving device designated for  the  submission
 and receipt of electronic bids and offers.
  §  2.  Subdivision  2  of section 103 of the general municipal law, as
 amended by section 1 of chapter 367 of the laws of 2014, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  2.  Advertisement  for bids and offers shall be published in the offi-
 cial newspaper or newspapers, if any, or otherwise  in  a  newspaper  or
 newspapers  designated  for  such  purpose  and  may be published in the
 procurement opportunities newsletter pursuant to article four-C  of  the
 economic  development  law. Such advertisement shall contain a statement
 of the time when and place where all  bids  received  pursuant  to  such
 notice  will  be  publicly opened and read and where the identity of all
 offerers will be publicly disclosed, and the designation of the  receiv-
 ing  device  if the political subdivision or district has authorized the
 receipt of bids and offers in an electronic format. Such board or agency
 may by resolution designate any officer or employee to open the bids and
 offers at the time and place specified  in  the  notice.  Such  designee
 shall  make  a record of such bids and offers in such form and detail as
 the board or agency shall prescribe and present the  same  at  the  next
 regular  or  special  meeting of such board or agency. All bids received
 shall be publicly opened and read at the time and place so specified and
 the identity of all offerers shall be publicly disclosed at the time and
 place so specified. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE APPROPRIATE OFFICER, BOARD OR
 AGENCY OF A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION INHABITANTS  OR  MORE,
 OR  ANY  DISTRICT,  BOARD OR AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN
 SUCH CITY, MAY CONDUCT A PUBLIC OPENING, READING AND  IDENTIFICATION  BY
 MEANS  OF  LIVESTREAMING  ON A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE LISTED IN THE
 ADVERTISEMENT AT A TIME AND DATE SPECIFIED IN  SUCH  ADVERTISEMENT,  AND
 POST  A RECORD OF SUCH BIDS OR OFFERS AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED INFORMATION
 ON A WEBSITE MAINTAINED OR CONTROLLED BY SUCH DISTRICT,  OFFICER,  BOARD
 OR AGENCY ON SUCH DATE WITHIN FIVE DAYS. At least five days shall elapse
 between  the  first  publication  of  such advertisement and the date so
 specified for the opening and reading of bids and offers.
  § 3. This act shall take effect March 1, 2024; provided, however, that
 if the chapter of the laws of 2023 amending part X of chapter 62 of  the
 laws  of 2003 amending the general business law and other laws generally
 relating to implementing the state fiscal plan for the  2003-2004  state
 fiscal  year,  relating  to  extending certain provisions of the general
 municipal law and the local finance law relating to electronic  bidding,
 as  proposed  in  legislative bills numbers S. 7363-A and A. 7445, shall
 not have taken effect on or before such date then sections one  and  two
 of this act shall take effect on the same date and in the same manner as
 such  chapter of the laws of 2023, takes effect;  and provided, further,
 that:
  (a) the amendments to subdivisions 1 and  2  of  section  103  of  the
 general municipal law made by sections one and two of this act shall not
 apply to any solicitation released prior to the date upon which this act
 takes effect; and
  (b)  the  amendments  to  subdivisions  1  and 2 of section 103 of the
 general municipal law made by sections one and two of this act shall not
 affect the expiration and reversion of such subdivisions as provided  in
 subdivision  (a)  of  section  41 of part X of chapter 62 of the laws of
 2003, as amended, and shall expire and be deemed repealed therewith.
