 individual's institutional record to determine whether  he  or  she  has
 complied  with the assigned program. If the commissioner determines that
 the incarcerated individual has successfully participated in the program

 bility,  shall be granted parole release at the expiration of his or her

 cerated individual's institutional record to determine whether he or she
 has complied with the assigned program. If the  commissioner  determines
 that  the  incarcerated  individual has successfully participated in the
 program he or she may issue the incarcerated individual a certificate of
 earned eligibility. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  an
 incarcerated individual who is serving a sentence with a minimum term of
 not  more than six years and who has been issued a certificate of earned
 eligibility, shall be granted parole release at the expiration of his or
 her minimum term, OR WHERE APPLICABLE, AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE  MINIMUM
