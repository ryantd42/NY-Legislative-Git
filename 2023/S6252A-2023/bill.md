  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide an increase in the defined benefit cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with a payment in September 2024, additional payments will  be  made
 for those members who retired after 1960 and prior to 1973.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $171,000. To fund these costs, the State  of
 New  York  will  be  required to pay $191,000 (including interest) as of
 March 1, 2025.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $232,000.
 S. 6252--A  6
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1-5  $232,000  $111,000
  Tier 6  $0  $121,000
  Total  $232,000  $232,000
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS would be approximately $4,300 to
 the State of New York and approximately $18,000 to the local participat-
 ing  employers  in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. This permanent
 annual cost will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes  in  the
 billing rate and salary of the affected members.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 42 retirees and beneficiaries in
 the NYSLERS and 41 pin the NYSLPFRS as of March 31, 2023.
