 AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to  prohibiting  recurring

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The election law is amended by adding a new section  14-115

 UTION  IN  EACH  COMMUNICATION  WITH  THE  CONTRIBUTOR THAT CONCERNS THE
