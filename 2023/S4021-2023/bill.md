 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation  to  establishing  an
  office  of  antibiotic-resistance  control; to amend the state finance

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. Antibiotics are rightfully considered
 one of the medical miracles of the last century because of their  power-
 ful  ability  to  fight  illness and disease caused by bacteria. But the
 effectiveness of medically important antibiotics is now  at  great  risk
 due  to  their  misuse  and  overuse  in  medicine and agriculture. Many
 strains of bacteria have  evolved  resistance  to  antibiotics,  meaning
 instead  of  being  killed  by  the  drugs,  they survive, multiply, and
 spread. In fact, the more antibiotics are used, the  faster  antibiotic-
 resistant  bacteria  (aka  "superbugs")  emerge,  increasing the risk of
 contracting an antibiotic-resistant infection. If effective policy meas-
 ures are not soon adopted, some experts predict that by 2050,  antibiot-
 ic-resistant  infections will be responsible for more annual deaths than
 cancer.
  In recognition of the serious public health threat posed by  antibiot-
 ic-resistant  infections,  the  United  Nations General Assembly in 2016
 committed to taking action. The World Health Organization (WHO)  consid-
 ers it to be one of the biggest threats to global health, food security,
 and  international  development  today.  The  United  States Centers for
 Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  has  stated  that  fighting  this
 threat is a public health priority and estimates that each year, antibi-

 otic-resistant  bacteria  are  responsible  for  at  least  2.8  million
 infections in the United States and at  least  35,000  deaths.  A  study
 commissioned by the United Kingdom government predicts that if action is
 not  taken now to combat antibiotic resistance, by 2050 the annual death
 toll will have risen to 10 million  globally.  Most  major  medical  and
 health groups in the United States, including the American Medical Asso-
 ciation, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Infectious Diseases Society
 of  America,  have  recognized  the urgency of the antibiotic-resistance
 crisis. New York State, in its Prevention Agenda 2019-2024,  established
 Antibiotic  Resistance  and  Healthcare-Associated  Infections as one of
 five major focus areas.
  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are bacteria  that  are  immune  to  the
 effect of antibiotics. These so-called "superbugs" can infect humans and
 animals, and the infections they cause are harder and sometimes impossi-
 ble to treat. Antibiotic resistance is a naturally occurring phenomenon,
 but  the speed at which superbugs are emerging and spreading is acceler-
 ating due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics in  humans  and  animals.
 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are most prevalent in environments associ-
 ated  with  high antibiotic use: healthcare settings and animal agricul-
 ture. Two-thirds of all medically important antibiotics are sold for use
 in animals. Bacteria that  are  resistant  can  spread  from  person  to
 person,  and  from  animal  to  person--via  the  natural environment or
 contaminated food--and resistance genes can transfer  from  bacteria  to
 bacteria.  Some bacteria have developed resistance to multiple antibiot-
 ics, making common infectious diseases such as tuberculosis,  pneumonia,
 food  poisoning,  urinary  tract infections (UTIs), and gonorrhea harder
 and sometimes impossible to treat. Everyone is at risk  of  exposure  to
 antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but those who work in hospitals and nurs-
 ing  homes, patients in such facilities, and those who work in livestock
 farming, slaughterhouses, and large animal veterinarian practices have a
 greater risk of getting antibiotic-resistant infections.
  Given the current and growing threat posed by  antibiotic  resistance,
 the  state  of  New York must organize itself to adequately respond. The
 WHO and the CDC recommend taking a "One Health" approach,  which  recog-
 nizes  the interconnectedness of humans and animals in achieving optimal
 health outcomes.
