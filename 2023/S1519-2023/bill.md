  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  the  commissioner  may
 acquire such property as may be necessary for the purposes and functions

 Such property may be acquired pursuant to the provisions of the  eminent
 domain  procedure law, or by purchase, lease, exchange, grant, condemna-
 tion, gift, devise, bequest, or by any other lawful means. No real prop-
 erty shall be so acquired unless the title thereto is  approved  by  the
 attorney  general.  PROVIDED,  FURTHER, THAT NO REAL PROPERTY SHALL BE
 ACQUIRED, RECEIVED, HELD OR ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMISSIONER UNLESS  THE
 MINERAL  RIGHTS  ON AND UNDER SUCH LAND ARE ALSO ACQUIRED BY THE COMMIS-
 SIONER IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE  OF  NEW  YORK;  PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER,  THAT THE COMMISSIONER MAY ACQUIRE, RECEIVE, HOLD OR ADMINISTER
 REAL PROPERTY TO WHICH HE OR SHE HAS NOT  ACQUIRED  THE  MINERAL  RIGHTS
 THERETO IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT SUCH REAL PROP-
 ERTY IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE.  PRIOR TO THE
 ACQUISITION,  RECEIPT, HOLDING OR ADMINISTRATION OF REAL PROPERTY BY THE
 OFFICE TO WHICH THE COMMISSIONER HAS NOT  ACQUIRED  THE  MINERAL  RIGHTS
 THERETO, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ISSUE AN ANALYTICAL REPORT THAT PROVIDES
 JUSTIFICATION  AND THE RATIONALE FOR SUCH PROPERTY ACQUISITION, NOTWITH-
