  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Kinship Care Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness of issues  that
affect the lives of residents of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is moved to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023, as Kinship Care Month
in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship Care Month is observed in  September  to  recognize
children in kinship families, and the grandparents, other relatives, and
family  friends  who  raise them, ensuring their safety, promoting their
well-being, and establishing a stable household for these  young  people
to thrive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  kinship  families,  a  caregiver  cares for a child or
children who were biologically born to another family  member  or  close
friend because the biological parents are unable to raise them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nationally,  approximately 2.7 million children are living
with grandparents and other relatives in kinship care; more than 195,000
of these young people reside in the State of New York, with  fewer  than
7,500 kinship children in foster care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  grandparents  provide  more than 60% of all kinship
care, aunts, uncles, adult siblings, other relatives, and family friends
are also acting as parents for vulnerable children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of these kinship caregivers give up  their  retirement
years to assume parenting duties for children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  children come to live with kinship caregivers, after
allegations of parental abuse or neglect; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because of  parental  substance  use  disorders  and  other
adverse  childhood experiences, children in kinship care frequently have
trauma-related conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kinship  caregivers  often  cope  with  difficult  family
relations  caused by parental addictions, incarcerations, mental illness
and other unfortunate circumstance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship care homes offer a refuge for traumatized children;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship care is a national resource  that  provides  loving
homes for vulnerable at risk children; and
 
  WHEREAS, One in 11 of all children, and one in five African-American
children,  will  live  within  a  kinship  family  sometime during their
childhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kinship  caregivers  reside  in  urban, rural and suburban
households in every county of this great Empire State, stepping  forward
out of love and loyalty to care for their young relatives, offering much
needed  continuity  and  security, and providing the best opportunity to
retain a child's cultural heritage and community ties; and
 
  WHEREAS, The number  of  congregate  care  placements  continues  to
decrease  and child welfare agencies are increasingly reliant on kinship
families; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship caregivers are increasingly providing caring  homes
for children because of the opioid crisis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The wisdom and compassion of kinship caregivers is a source
of  self-reliance  and  strength  for countless children and for all New
Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kinship  Care  Month  honors  the  priceless  role  these
grandparents  and other kin play in the lives of the children they love;
famous kinship caregivers include President George Washington; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship Care Month also recognizes  the  accomplishment  of
countless  youth  throughout  this  great  Empire  State, and across the
nation, who, with the unconditional support of  grandparents  and  other
relatives,  have  successfully  navigated the emotional trauma of losing
their parents; famous youth who were raised in kinship care include Maya
Angelou, Sandra Day O'Connor, and President Barack Obama; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is vitally important the public grow in awareness of the
challenges faced  by  children,  grandparents  and  other  relatives  in
kinship  families;  partnerships  among  the  education,  legal,  social
services, mental health, justice, and other  systems  are  necessary  to
ensure  access to the services that can enable kinship youth to flourish
in all facets of their life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  entire  community  of  New  Yorkers  expresses  its
wholehearted  support  for kinship caregivers in their task of providing
loving homes for children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kinship Care Month is reflective of the values  of  family,
community,  and  the  welfare  of children shared by citizens across New
York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023, as Kinship
Care Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
