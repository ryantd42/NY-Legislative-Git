 AN ACT authorizing the Bais Tefila of Inwood to receive retroactive real
  property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Bais Tefila of Inwood, an application for exemption from  real  property
 taxes  pursuant  to  section  420-a  of  the  real property tax law with
 respect to the 2019-2020 assessment roll  for  a  portion  of  the  2019
 general  taxes  and  all  of  the  2020  general  taxes,  and all of the
 2019-2020 school taxes for the parcel  conveyed  to  such  organization,
 with such parcel being located at 259 Doughty Blvd, in the town of Hemp-
 stead,  otherwise  known as Nassau county tax map section 40, block 163,
 lot 216.  If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as  if  it  had
 been received on or before the taxable status dates established for such
 rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption if such organization had acquired  the  subject  property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date,  the assessor, upon approval by the Nassau county legislature, may
 grant exemption from all taxation and make  appropriate  corrections  to
 the  subject rolls.  If such exemption is granted and such organization
 therefore shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject roll,  the
 governing  body  or  tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide
 for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel any taxes,  fines,  penal-
 ties, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
