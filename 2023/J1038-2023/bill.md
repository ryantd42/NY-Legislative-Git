  COMMEMORATING  the  56th  Anniversary of the world
  famous African Record Center
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups and their
respected  organizations  which  comprise and contribute to the richness
and diversity of the community of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 56th Anniversary of  the  world  famous  African  Record
Center; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  humble  beginnings in 1969, the world famous African
Record Center, also known as the ARC Distributor, has served as a  mecca
of  African  culture  and  music  in  Brooklyn, New York for the last 56
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Owned and operated  by  brothers  Roger  Francis  and  Rudy
Francis, the world famous African Record Center specializes in Afrobeat,
Zouk,  and  Calypso  records;  in addition to music, they sell Caribbean
crafts,  including  handwoven  baskets  and  sculptures,  masks,  and
instruments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  making  a noble effort to preserve African culture,
the  world  famous  African  Record  Center  since  its  opening  has
distributed,  promoted,  and  introduced African music to its community;
their first efforts were to introduce  African  music  into  the  United
States because before that time nothing existed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  their  first  store  based in Harlem, Manhattan, the
world famous African Record Center's crowning achievement is  that  they
are  able  to  bring  African  nationals  together  from  all  over  the
continent, whether they are  dignitaries  from  the  United  Nations  or
African students, to meet in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful  care  on behalf of improving the quality and dignity of life
in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 56th Anniversary of  the  world  famous  African  Record
Center; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the African Record Center Ltd.
