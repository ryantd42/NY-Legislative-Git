 ed  for  good  behavior  and efficient and willing performance of duties
 assigned or progress and achievement in an assigned  treatment  program,
 and  may  be withheld, forfeited or canceled in whole or in part for bad
 behavior, violation of institutional rules or failure to perform proper-

 ALLOWANCES  SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPHS (B) AND (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, MAY
 BE REINSTATED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND EFFICIENT AND WILLING PERFORMANCE OF
 DUTIES ASSIGNED OR PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENT  IN  AN  ASSIGNED  TREATMENT

 WITH THIS PROVISION.
  (b)  A  person serving an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment [may]
 SHALL receive A time allowance against the maximum term of [his or  her]
 THEIR sentence [not to exceed one-third] of ONE-HALF OF the maximum term
 imposed by the court.
  (c)  A  person  serving  a  determinate sentence of imprisonment [may]
 SHALL receive A time allowance against the term of [his  or  her]  THEIR

  (d) (i) [Except as provided in subparagraph (ii)  of  this  paragraph,
 every] EVERY person under the custody of the department or confined in a

 S. 774--A  3

 determinate sentence of imprisonment of one year or more [imposed pursu-
 ant  to  section 70.70 or 70.71 of the penal law,] may earn a merit time
 allowance.
  (ii)  [Such  merit time allowance shall not be available to any person
 serving an indeterminate sentence authorized for an A-I felony  offense,
 other  than  an A-I felony offense defined in article two hundred twenty
 of the penal law, or any sentence imposed for a violent  felony  offense
 as defined in section 70.02 of the penal law, manslaughter in the second
 degree,  vehicular  manslaughter  in  the  second  degree,  vehicular
 manslaughter in the first  degree,  criminally  negligent  homicide,  an
 offense  defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law, incest,

 ual.
  (iii)]  The  merit time allowance credit against the minimum period of
 the indeterminate sentence shall be [one-sixth] ONE-HALF of the  minimum
 period  imposed by the court [except that such credit shall be one-third
 of the minimum period imposed by the court for  an  A-I  felony  offense
 defined  in article two hundred twenty of the penal law]. In the case of
 such a determinate sentence, in addition to the  time  allowance  credit
 authorized  by  paragraph (c) of this subdivision, the merit time allow-
 ance credited against the term of the determinate sentence  pursuant  to
 this paragraph shall be [one-seventh] ONE-QUARTER of the term imposed by
 the court.
  [(iv)]  (III) Such merit time allowance [may] SHALL be granted when an
 incarcerated individual successfully participates in the work and treat-
 ment program assigned pursuant to section eight  hundred  five  of  this
 article [and], INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO when such incarcerated indi-
 vidual  obtains  a general equivalency diploma, an alcohol and substance
 abuse treatment certificate, a vocational trade  certificate  [following
 at  least six months of vocational programming], at least eighteen cred-
 its in a program registered by the state  education  department  from  a

 hundred hours of service as part of a community work crew,  OR  SUCCESS-
 FULLY  COMPLETES  ONE OR MORE "SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS"
 AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED
 THREE-B  OF  THIS  ARTICLE.  THE  COMMISSIONER  MAY DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL
 PROGRAMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS FOR WHICH MERIT TIME SHALL  BE  GRANTED.  ONCE
 GRANTED, SUCH ALLOWANCES SHALL NOT BE WITHHELD, FORFEITED, OR CANCELLED.
 WHERE  THE  INSTITUTION IN WHICH THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL IS CONFINED
 DOES NOT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL TO EARN
 MERIT TIME ALLOWANCES, SUCH MERIT TIME ALLOWANCE SHALL BE  AUTOMATICALLY
 CREDITED  AGAINST  THE  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL'S SENTENCE ACCORDING TO
 SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  [Such allowance shall be withheld for any serious disciplinary infrac-
 tion or upon a judicial determination that the person, while  an  incar-
 cerated individual, commenced or continued a civil action, proceeding or
 claim  that  was  found to be frivolous as defined in subdivision (c) of
 section eight thousand three hundred three-a of the civil  practice  law
 and  rules,  or  an  order of a federal court pursuant to rule 11 of the
 federal rules  of  civil  procedure  imposing  sanctions  in  an  action
 commenced by a person, while an incarcerated individual, against a state
 agency, officer or employee.
  (v)]  (IV)  The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to persons in
 custody serving [an] A DETERMINATE  OR  indeterminate  sentence  on  the
 effective date of this paragraph as well as to persons sentenced to [an]
 S. 774--A  4
 
 A  DETERMINATE OR indeterminate sentence on and after the effective date
 of this paragraph [and prior to September first, two thousand  five  and
 to persons sentenced to a determinate sentence prior to September first,
 two thousand eleven for a felony as defined in article two hundred twen-
 ty  or two hundred twenty-one of the penal law]. THE TIME ALLOWANCES SET
 FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL APPLY RETROACTIVELY AND SHALL BE  CREDITED
 TOWARD  EVERY  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL'S SENTENCE WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF
 THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR  THAT  AMENDED  THIS
 PARAGRAPH.
  2.  If  a  person  is  serving  more than one sentence, the authorized
 allowances may be granted separately against the term or maximum term of
 each sentence or, where consecutive sentences are involved, against  the
 aggregate maximum term. Such allowances shall be calculated as follows:
  (a)  A  person  serving  two or more indeterminate sentences which run
 concurrently [may] SHALL receive A time allowance [not  to  exceed  one-
 third]  of  ONE-HALF OF the indeterminate sentence which has the longest
 unexpired time to run.
  (b) A person serving two or more  indeterminate  sentences  which  run
 consecutively  [may]  SHALL receive A time allowance [not to exceed one-
 third] of ONE-HALF OF the aggregate maximum term.
  (c) A person serving two  or  more  determinate  sentences  which  run
 concurrently  [may]  SHALL  receive A time allowance [not to exceed one-
 seventh] of ONE-HALF OF the determinate sentence which has  the  longest
 unexpired time to run.
  (d)  A  person  serving  two  or  more determinate sentences which run
 consecutively [may] SHALL receive A time allowance [not to  exceed  one-
 seventh] of ONE-HALF OF the aggregate maximum term.
  (e)  A  person  serving  one or more indeterminate sentence and one or
 more determinate sentence which run concurrently [may] SHALL  receive  A
 time  allowance  [not to exceed one-third] of ONE-HALF OF the indetermi-
 nate sentence which has the longest unexpired term to run  or  [one-sev-
 enth]  ONE-HALF  of the determinate sentence which has the longest unex-
 pired time to run, whichever allowance is greater.
  (f) A person serving one or more indeterminate  sentence  and  one  or
 more  determinate sentence which run consecutively [may] SHALL receive A
 time allowance [not to exceed] OF the sum of [one-third] ONE-HALF of the
 maximum or aggregate maximum of the indeterminate sentence or  sentences
 and  [one-seventh]  ONE-HALF  of  the  term  or aggregate maximum of the
 determinate sentence or sentences.
  2-a. If a person is serving more than  one  sentence,  the  authorized
 merit  time  allowances  may  be granted against the period or aggregate
 minimum period of the indeterminate sentence or  sentences,  or  against
 the  term or aggregate term of the determinate sentence or sentences, or
 where consecutive determinate and indeterminate sentences are  involved,
 against  the aggregate minimum period as calculated pursuant to subpara-
 graph (iv) of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 70.40  of  the
 penal law. Such allowances shall be calculated as follows:
  (a)  A  person  serving  two or more indeterminate sentences which run
 concurrently may receive a merit time  allowance  not  to  exceed  [one-
 sixth]  ONE-HALF  of  the  minimum  period of the indeterminate sentence
 imposed [for an offense other than an  A-I  felony  offense  defined  in
 article two hundred twenty of the penal law, or one-third of the minimum
 period  of  the indeterminate sentence imposed for an A-I felony offense
 defined in article two hundred twenty of the penal law, whichever allow-
 ance results in the longest unexpired time to run] BY THE COURT.
 S. 774--A  5
 
  (b) A person serving two or more  indeterminate  sentences  which  run
 consecutively  may  receive  a  merit  time  allowance not to exceed the
 amount of [one-third] ONE-HALF of the minimum or aggregate minimum peri-
 od of the sentences imposed [for an A-I felony offense defined in  arti-
 cle  two  hundred twenty of the penal law, plus one-sixth of the minimum
 or aggregate minimum period of the  sentences  imposed  for  an  offense
 other than such A-I felony offense] BY THE COURT.
  (c) A person serving two or more determinate sentences [for an offense
 defined  in  article two hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-one of the
 penal law] which run concurrently may receive a merit time allowance not
 to exceed [one-seventh] ONE-QUARTER  of  the  term  of  the  determinate
 sentence which has the longest unexpired time to run.
  (d) A person serving two or more determinate sentences [for an offense
 defined  in  article two hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-one of the
 penal law] which run consecutively may receive a  merit  time  allowance
 not  to  exceed  [one-seventh] ONE-QUARTER of the aggregate term of such
 determinate sentences.
  (e) A person serving one or more indeterminate sentences  and  one  or
 more  determinate  sentences  [for  an  offense  defined  in article two
 hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-one of the  penal  law]  which  run
 concurrently  may  receive  a  merit  time allowance not to exceed [one-
 sixth] ONE-HALF of the minimum  period  of  the  indeterminate  sentence

 period  of  the indeterminate sentence imposed for an A-I felony offense
 defined in article two hundred twenty of the penal  law,]  or  [one-sev-
 enth]  ONE-QUARTER  of  the  term of the determinate sentence, whichever
 allowance results in the largest unexpired time to run.
  (f) A person serving one or more indeterminate sentences  and  one  or
 more  determinate  sentences which run consecutively may receive a merit
 time allowance not to exceed the sum  of  [one-sixth]  ONE-HALF  of  the
 minimum  or  aggregate  minimum  period of the indeterminate sentence or
 sentences imposed [for an offense  other  than  an  A-I  felony  offense
 defined in article two hundred twenty of the penal law, one-third of the
 minimum  or  aggregate  minimum  period of the indeterminate sentence or
 sentences imposed for an A-I  felony  offense  defined  in  article  two
 hundred  twenty  of  the penal law] and [one-seventh] ONE-QUARTER of the
 term or aggregate term of the determinate sentence or sentences.
  (g) The provisions of this  subdivision  shall  apply  to  persons  in
 custody  serving  [an]  A  DETERMINATE  OR indeterminate sentence on the
 effective date of this subdivision as well as to  persons  sentenced  to
 [an]  A DETERMINATE OR indeterminate sentence on and after the effective
 date of this subdivision [and prior to  September  first,  two  thousand
 five and to persons sentenced to a determinate sentence prior to Septem-
 ber  first,  two  thousand eleven for a felony as defined in article two
 hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-one of the penal  law].  THE  MERIT
 TIME ALLOWANCES SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL APPLY RETROACTIVELY,
 AND  SHALL  BE  CREDITED TOWARD EVERY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S SENTENCE
 WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE  LAWS  OF
 TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR THAT AMENDED THIS SUBDIVISION.
  [2-b.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a person is serving more than
 one indeterminate sentence, at least one of which is imposed for a class
 A-I felony offense defined in article two hundred twenty  of  the  penal
 law,  the  authorized merit time allowance granted pursuant to paragraph
 (d) of subdivision one of this section shall be calculated as follows:
 S. 774--A  6

  (a) In the event  a  person  is  serving  two  or  more  indeterminate
 sentences  with  different  minimum  periods which run concurrently, the
 merit time allowance shall be based upon the sentence with  the  longest
 unexpired  minimum  period.  If  the sentence with the longest unexpired
 minimum period was imposed for a class A-I felony, the merit time credit
 shall  be  one-third of such sentence's minimum period; if such sentence
 was imposed for an offense other than a class  A-I  felony,  such  merit
 time  credit  shall  be  one-sixth  of  such  sentence's minimum period.
 Provided, however, that where the minimum period of any other concurrent
 indeterminate sentence is greater than such reduced minimum period,  the
 minimum  period  of  such  other concurrent indeterminate sentence shall
 also be reduced but only to the extent that the minimum period  of  such
 other  concurrent sentence, as so reduced, is equal to the reduced mini-
 mum period of such sentence with the longest unexpired minimum period to
 run.
  (b) A person serving two or more indeterminate sentences with the same
 minimum periods which run concurrently, and no concurrent  indeterminate
 sentence  with any greater minimum period, shall have the minimum period
 of each such sentence reduced in the amount of one-third of such minimum
 period if all such sentences were imposed for a class A-I felony.
  (c) A person serving two or  more  indeterminate  sentences  that  run
 consecutively  shall have the aggregate minimum period of such sentences
 reduced in the amount of one-third of such aggregate minimum  period  of
 the  sentences  imposed  for  a class A-I felony, plus one-sixth of such
 aggregate minimum period of the sentences imposed for an  offense  other
 than a class A-I felony.]
  3.  The  commissioner  of  corrections and community supervision shall
 promulgate rules and regulations for the FAIR  AND  EQUITABLE  granting,
 withholding,  forfeiture,  cancellation  and  restoration  of allowances
 authorized by this section in accordance with the criteria herein speci-
 fied. Such rules and regulations shall SPECIFY PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT
 SIMILARLY SITUATED  INCARCERATED  PERSONS  ARE  TREATED  SIMILARLY  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  THE  GRANTING,  WITHHOLDING,  FORFEITURE OR CANCELLATION OF
 ALLOWANCES, AND include provisions designating the person  or  committee
 in  each correctional institution delegated to make discretionary deter-
 minations with respect to the allowances, the books and  records  to  be
 kept,  and a procedure for review of the institutional determinations by
 the commissioner.
  4. [No person shall have the right to demand or require the allowances
 authorized  by  this  section.  The  decision  of  the  commissioner  of
 corrections  and  community supervision as to the granting, withholding,
 forfeiture, cancellation or restoration  of  such  allowances  shall  be
 final and shall not be reviewable if made in accordance with law.
  5.]  Time  allowances granted prior to any release to community super-
 vision shall be forfeited and shall not  be  restored  if  the  released
 person is returned to an institution under the jurisdiction of the state
 department  of  corrections  and  community supervision for violation of
 community supervision or by reason of a conviction for a crime committed
 while on community supervision. A person who is so returned may,  howev-
 er,  subsequently  receive time allowances against the remaining portion
 of [his or her] THEIR term,  maximum  term  or  aggregate  maximum  term
 pursuant  to this section [and provided such remaining portion of his or
 her term, maximum term, or aggregate  maximum  term  is  more  than  one
 year].
  [6.]  5.  Upon  commencement  of  an  indeterminate  or  a determinate
 sentence the provisions of this section shall be furnished to the person
 S. 774--A  7
 
 serving the sentence and the meaning of same shall be fully explained to
 [him] THEM by a person designated by the commissioner  to  perform  such
 duty.
  § 4. Section 804 of the correction law, as added by chapter 680 of the
 laws of 1967, subdivisions 1 and 2 as amended by chapter 145 of the laws
 of 1976, and subdivision 6 as amended by section 39 of subpart B of part
 C of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, is amended to read as follows:
  §  804.  Good behavior allowances against definite sentences. 1. Every
 person confined in an institution serving a definite sentence of  impri-
 sonment  [may]  SHALL  receive  A  time  [allowances  as  discretionary
 reductions of the term of his sentence not to exceed  in  the  aggregate
 one-third]  ALLOWANCE OF ONE-HALF of the term imposed by the court. Such
 allowances [may be granted for good behavior and efficient  and  willing
 performance  of  duties  assigned  or  progress  and  achievement  in an
 assigned treatment program, and may be withheld, forfeited or  cancelled
 in  whole  or in part for bad behavior, violation of institutional rules
 or failure to perform properly in the duties or program assigned]  SHALL
 BE  CREDITED TOWARD A PERSON'S SENTENCE ON AN ANNUAL PRO RATA BASIS, AND
 ANY CREDIT AWARDED OVER THE COURSE OF THE CALENDAR YEAR  SHALL  VEST  ON
 THE  FINAL DAY OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.  ONCE VESTED, SUCH CREDIT SHALL NOT
 BE WITHHELD, FORFEITED, OR CANCELED.
  1-A. TIME ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN GRANTED TOWARD A  PERSON'S
 SENTENCE  MAY BE WITHHELD, FORFEITED OR CANCELED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR
 VIOLATION OF INSTITUTIONAL RULES, AS DEMONSTRATED  AT  A  HEARING  BY  A
 PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. SUCH RESTRICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
 PRO  RATA  SHARE  OF CREDIT WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT THE OFFENSE IS
 COMMITTED. IF SUCH TIME ALLOWANCE IS WITHHELD, FORFEITED OR CANCELED  IN
 WHOLE OR IN PART, FURTHER ALLOWANCES, NOT TO EXCEED ONE-HALF OF THE TERM
 IMPOSED  BY THE COURT, MAY BE REINSTATED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND EFFICIENT
 AND WILLING PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES ASSIGNED OR PROGRESS  AND  ACHIEVEMENT
 IN  AN  ASSIGNED  TREATMENT  PROGRAM.  FOLLOWING ANY FINAL DETERMINATION
 WITHHOLDING, FORFEITING, OR CANCELING A TIME ALLOWANCE, THE INCARCERATED
 PERSON SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  APPEAL  TO  THE
 SHERIFF  AND  SHALL  BE ADVISED OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN
 THE TAKING OF SUCH  APPEAL.  THE  SHERIFF  SHALL  ADOPT  REGULATIONS  IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
  2.  If  a  person  is  serving  more than one sentence, the authorized
 allowances may be granted separately against the term of  each  sentence
 or,  where  consecutive  sentences  are  involved, against the aggregate
 term. Allowances based upon sentences of less  than  one  month  may  be
 granted,  and  in  such  case the maximum allowance shall be one day for
 every [three] TWO days of the sentence. In no case, however,  shall  the
 total  of  all  allowances granted to any such person exceed [one-third]
 ONE-HALF of the time [he] THEY would  be  required  to  serve,  computed
 without regard to this section.
  3. [No person shall have the right to demand or require the allowances
 authorized by this section. The decision of the sheriff, superintendent,
 warden  or  other  person  in  charge  of the institution, or where such
 institution is under the jurisdiction of a county or city department the
 decision of the head of such department, as to the  granting,  withhold-
 ing, forfeiture, cancellation or restoration of such allowances shall be
 final and shall not be reviewable if made in accordance with law.
  4.]  A  person who has earned a reduction of sentence pursuant to this
 section and who has been conditionally released under subdivision two of
 section 70.40 of the penal law  shall  not  forfeit  such  reduction  by
 reason  of  conduct  causing  [his]  THEIR  return  to  the institution.
 S. 774--A  8
 
 Provided, nevertheless, that such reduction may be forfeited  by  reason
 of subsequent conduct while serving the remainder of [his] THEIR term.
  [5.]  4.  The  state  commission of correction shall promulgate record
 keeping rules and regulations for the FAIR AND EQUITABLE granting, with-
 holding, forfeiture, cancellation and restoration of allowances  author-
 ized  by  this  section. SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS SHALL SPECIFY PROCE-
 DURES TO ENSURE THAT SIMILARLY SITUATED INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE TREATED
 SIMILARLY WITH RESPECT  TO  THE  GRANTING,  WITHHOLDING,  FORFEITURE  OR
 CANCELLATION OF ALLOWANCES.
  [6.]  5.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, in
 any case where a person is serving a definite sentence in an institution
 under the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections and commu-
 nity supervision, [subdivisions] SUBDIVISION three [and four] of section
 eight hundred three of this [chapter] ARTICLE shall apply.
  [7.] 6. Upon commencement of any definite sentence the  provisions  of
 this  section  shall be furnished to the person serving the sentence and
 the meaning of same shall be fully explained to [him] THEM by an officer
 designated in the regulation to perform such duty.
  § 5. Section 804-a of the correction law, as added by chapter  220  of
 the laws of 1987, is amended to read as follows:
  §  804-a.  Good  behavior allowances for certain civil commitments. 1.
 Every person confined in an institution serving a civil commitment for a
 fixed period of time, whose release is  not  conditional  upon  any  act
 within [his] THEIR power to perform, [may] SHALL receive time allowances
 as discretionary reductions of the term of [his] THEIR commitment not to
 exceed,  in  the  aggregate, [one-third] ONE-HALF of the term imposed by
 the court.  Such allowances [may be granted for good behavior and  effi-
 cient  and  willing  performance  of  duties  assigned  or  progress and
 achievement in an assigned  treatment  program,  and  may  be  withheld,
 forfeited  or  cancelled in whole or in part for bad behavior, violation
 of institutional rules or failure to perform properly in the  duties  or
 program  assigned]  SHALL  BE  CREDITED TOWARD A PERSON'S SENTENCE ON AN
 ANNUAL PRO RATA BASIS, AND ANY CREDIT AWARDED OVER  THE  COURSE  OF  THE
 CALENDAR  YEAR  SHALL  VEST ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.  ONCE
 VESTED, SUCH CREDIT SHALL NOT BE WITHHELD, FORFEITED, OR CANCELED.
  1-A. TIME ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN GRANTED TOWARD A  PERSON'S
 SENTENCE  MAY BE WITHHELD, FORFEITED OR CANCELED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR
 VIOLATION OF INSTITUTIONAL RULES, AS DEMONSTRATED  AT  A  HEARING  BY  A
 PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. SUCH RESTRICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
 PRO  RATA  SHARE  OF CREDIT WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT THE OFFENSE IS
 COMMITTED. IF SUCH TIME ALLOWANCE IS WITHHELD, FORFEITED OR CANCELED  IN
 WHOLE OR IN PART, FURTHER ALLOWANCES, NOT TO EXCEED ONE-HALF OF THE TERM
 IMPOSED  BY THE COURT, MAY BE REINSTATED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND EFFICIENT
 AND WILLING PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES ASSIGNED OR PROGRESS  AND  ACHIEVEMENT
 IN  AN  ASSIGNED  TREATMENT  PROGRAM.  FOLLOWING ANY FINAL DETERMINATION
 WITHHOLDING, FORFEITING, OR CANCELING A TIME ALLOWANCE, THE INCARCERATED
 PERSON SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  APPEAL  TO  THE
 CENTRAL  OFFICE  OF  THE DEPARTMENT AND SHALL BE ADVISED OF THE RIGHT TO
 SEEK LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN THE TAKING OF SUCH APPEAL. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL
 ADOPT REGULATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
  2. Allowances based upon commitments of less than  one  month  may  be
 granted,  and  in  such case the maximum allowances shall be one day for

 diately eligible to be conditionally released.
