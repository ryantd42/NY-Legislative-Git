  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 10, 2023, as Siblings Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  Siblings  Day  Foundation  is  a public non-profit charity
devoted to establishing Siblings Day for the benefit  of  our  families,
our communities and our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 10, 2023, as Siblings Day in the
State of New York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National
Siblings Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Native  New  Yorker,  and Manhattan resident Claudia Evart
felt inspired to create the Siblings Day Foundation (SDF)  after  losing
both of her siblings early in life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the luminous leadership of Claudia Evart, SDF founded
National  Siblings  Day  to honor our brother(s) and/or sister(s), to be
celebrated annually on April  10,  the  birthday  of  her  late  sister,
Lisette; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  can remember their siblings by sending a card
or a gift, making a phone call, making a dinner invitation, performing a
good deed, favor, errand or chore, and in cases  of  deceased  siblings,
consciously holding them in their memory; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Siblings  Day follows the spirit of Mother's Day, Father's
Day and Grandparent's Day, a great American tradition and celebration of
family-unit values; it is an uplifting  festivity  honoring  people  who
have  shaped  our  values,  beliefs  and ideals; it is a relationship as
important as a parent's relationship; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  10,  2023, as
Siblings Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and Claudia Evart, Founder, Siblings Day Foundation.
