  COMMENDING  Staff  Sergeant  Aquilino  Gonell  in
  recognition of his  prompt  and  heroic  actions  in
  protecting  the  members of Congress and their staff
  while the United States Capitol was under attack  on
  January 6, 2021
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble police officers who exhibit  courage  and  bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives to preserve the life  and  property  of  another;  Staff
Sergeant Aquilino Gonell is one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commend and pay
just tribute to Staff Sergeant Aquilino Gonell  in  recognition  of  his
prompt  and  heroic  actions  in  protecting the members of Congress and
their staff while the United States Capitol was under attack on  January
6, 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, After immigrating from the Dominican Republic to the United
States in 1992, Aquilino Gonell fulfilled the American dream by becoming
a United States citizen and a college graduate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aquilino  Gonell proudly served his country as a member of
the United States Army during Operation Iraqi Freedom, followed  by  the
Army  Reserve;  during  his  deployment, this brave and selfless soldier
volunteered to conduct supply missions for  the  United  States,  allied
forces  and local Iraqi schools through the threat of bomb-filled roads;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon the completion of his military duties, Aquilino Gonell
joined the Capitol Police  Department  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and  once
again,  took  the  oath  to  defend  and protect the Constitution of the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 6, 2021, following  the  defeat  of  then-United
States  President  Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, a mob
of his  supporters  attacked  the  United  States  Capitol  Building  in
Washington,  D.C.  to  prevent a joint session of Congress from counting
the electoral college votes to formalize the victory of  President-elect
Joe Biden; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Heeding  the  call to defend the United States Capitol and
members of  Congress,  Staff  Sergeant  Aquilino  Gonell  quickly  found
himself immersed in the violence and mayhem enacted upon our government;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even  though  he knew what a dangerous situation he and so
many of his fellow officers were  in,  Staff  Sergeant  Aquilino  Gonell
 
charged  forward  and was caught in a tunnel on the West Front, where he
engaged in some of the most brutal fighting of the day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Staff  Sergeant  Aquilino  Gonell  was  hit  with  so much
chemical sprays that the liquid  soaked  through  to  his  skin  and  he
sustained  multiple  injuries,  several  of which he is still recovering
from; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hours into  the  attack  on  the  Capitol,  Staff  Sergeant
Aquilino  Gonell  later  learned that his wife and relatives were trying
desperately to contact him, but it was not until 4:26 p.m. that he had a
chance to text his wife to let her know he was alive; he made it home at
4:00 a.m. the next day and only four hours later, at 8:00 a.m.,  he  was
already  on  his  way  back to the Capitol, and continued to work for 15
consecutive days until after the inauguration of  President  Joe  Biden;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  On July 27, 2022, Staff Sergeant Aquilino Gonell and three
of his fellow officers bravely revisited the horror of that cold January
day, emotionally testifying before Congress about the events  that  took
place at the United States Capitol Building; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Staff  Sergeant Aquilino Gonell continues to heal,
both mentally and physically,  from  the  injuries  he  sustained  while
defending  the  Constitution  of  the United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Staff Sergeant Aquilino Gonell, through his spontaneous and
heroic actions, demonstrated his character and his  compassion  for  the
welfare  of  others,  personifying,  by  virtue  of  his  actions,  the
collective concern of law enforcement  officers  who  respond  naturally
when others need help; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such noble aims and actions are brought to our attention,
they should be celebrated and recognized by all  the  citizens  of  this
great Empire State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Staff Sergeant Aquilino Gonell in recognition of his prompt  and
heroic  actions  in  protecting  the members of Congress and their staff
while the United States Capitol was under attack on January 6, 2021; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Staff Sergeant Aquilino Gonell.
