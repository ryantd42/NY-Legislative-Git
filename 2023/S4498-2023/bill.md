  § 2. Section 390 of the social services law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 2-b to read as follows:
  2-B  (A) EVERY APPLICANT FOR A NEW OR RENEWAL LICENSE TO OPERATE A DAY
 CARE SERVICE SHALL DISCLOSE WHETHER A SERIOUS INJURY OR THE DEATH  OF  A
 CHILD  IN ITS CARE, OR THE CARE OF ANY OF ITS OWNERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOY-
 EES, VOLUNTEERS OR AGENTS, HAS OCCURRED. EVERY  SUCH  LICENSE  APPLICANT
 SHALL FURTHER DISCLOSE ANY CIVIL OR CRIMINAL COURT VERDICTS HOLDING THAT
 THE APPLICANT, OR ANY OF ITS OWNERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS OR

 BLE  EVIDENCE  THAT  THE  APPLICANT,  OR  ANY  OF ITS OWNERS, DIRECTORS,

 AND OTHER APPLICABLE LAW WILL BE MET. THE DEATH OF A CHILD OR THE OCCUR-
 RENCE OF MORE THAN ONE INCIDENT RESULTING IN A SERIOUS INJURY TO A CHILD
 OR CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF AN APPLICANT SHALL CREATE  A  PRESUMPTION  IN
 ANY  PROCEEDING  BROUGHT  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  TO  DENY OR REVOKE SUCH A
 LICENSE OF THE INABILITY OF THE APPLICANT TO COMPLY WITH THE  PROVISIONS
 OF  SAID  CODE  OR  OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL OTHERWISE
 LIMIT THE DEPARTMENT'S AUTHORITY TO DENY THE ISSUANCE OR  RENEWAL  OF  A
 LICENSE OR TO REVOKE A PERMIT.

 ANY  TIME FOR A SEX OFFENSE, CRIME AGAINST A CHILD, OR A CRIME INVOLVING
 VIOLENCE, OR A FELONY CONVICTION WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR A  DRUG-
 RELATED  OFFENSE,  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL,  WHEN CONSISTENT WITH ARTICLE
 TWENTY-THREE-A OF THE CORRECTION LAW, DENY THE APPLICATION FOR A  PERMIT
 TO OPERATE SUCH DAY CARE SERVICE.
  § 3. Section 390 of the social services law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 3-a to read as follows:
