  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide new members who first join  public  retirement
 systems  in  New  York  State  on  or after April 1, 2024, the option to
 become covered under the provisions of a new defined  contribution  plan
 in  lieu  of  the defined benefit plan. This plan would be mandatory for
 A. 6443  4
 
 elected officials who first join public retirement systems in  New  York
 State  on  or after April 1, 2024. Pursuant to Chapter 18 of the Laws of
 2012, participation currently is optional in a defined contribution plan
 for  non-union  employees hired on or after July 1, 2013 whose salary is
 $75,000 or higher.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  and  the  New  York  State and Local Police and Fire
 Retirement System,  the  significant  design  features  of  the  defined
 contribution plan include the following:
  1. Mandatory employer contributions of 4% of wages.
  2.  Matching  employer  contributions  for voluntary employee contrib-
 utions of up to 3% of wages.
  3. Employee and employer contributions are subject to limits in Feder-
 al Law.
  4. A death benefit equal to the accumulated value of employee contrib-
 utions, plus
  a) the member's salary after completion of one year of service,
  b) two years' salary after completion of two years of service,
  c) three years' salary after completion of three years of service, or
  d) if larger, the accumulated  value  of  all  employer  contributions
 previously made to the member's defined contribution account.
  5. There is no disability benefit.
  6.  Members may not opt out of the defined contribution plan once they
 have opted in.
  7. The defined contribution plan is to be administered by the New York
 State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS), which may enter into  agree-
 ments  with  qualified  providers  for investment of member accounts and
 general administration of the plan.
  Assuming that employees contribute 3% or more to maximize the employer
 match, the long-term expected total annual  employer  contribution  rate
 for  all  members who choose the defined contribution plan (includes the
 death benefit and the ongoing administrative rate) would be approximate-
 ly 7.7% of payroll.
  There would also  be  additional  NYSLRS  administrative  expenses  to
 establish the new defined contribution plan. Such expenses would include
 legal  costs to draft and submit plan documents for review by the Inter-
 nal Revenue Service, drafting and  promulgating  such  rules  and  regu-
 lations  as  may  be  necessary  or  required  to  implement the defined
 contribution plan,  entering  into  general  agreements  with  qualified
 providers  for  the  investment  of member accounts and general adminis-
 tration of the plan, informing employers and new members of the new plan
 provisions and establishing the defined contribution plan death benefit.
 These establishment expenses  are  currently  estimated  at  $3  to  $10
 million.
  Additionally,  the  state and participating employers will incur costs
 to modify their payroll systems  and  procedures  in  order  to  collect
 employee  contributions  and  remit  them  along with mandatory employer
 contributions shortly after each payroll. Such costs are estimated to be
 $1 million for changes to  the  state  payroll  system  related  to  the
 defined  benefit  and defined contribution plans. Remittance of employer
 contributions on a payroll schedule,  rather  than  annually  under  the
 defined  benefit  plan, will affect employers' cash management. Further,
 the bill contains no appropriation to  support  the  additional  payroll
 administrative  expense  to  the  Office of the State Comptroller or the
 implementation and ongoing expenses of NYSLRS related to the new defined
 contribution plan.

  In addition, employees will incur management and  investment  expenses
 for their defined contribution accounts estimated to average 0.5% of the
 account balance annually.
