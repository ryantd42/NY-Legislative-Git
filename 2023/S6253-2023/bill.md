  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to  the  New
 York  City Retirement Systems and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would add a new
 General Municipal Law (GML) Section  207-r  to  provide  certain  Deputy
 Sheriff  members  or  retirees  (within  five  years of their respective
 retirement dates) of the New  York  City  Employees'  Retirement  System
 (NYCERS) a rebuttable statutory presumption that a qualifying partial or
 total  disability or death related to a lung disease was incurred in the
 performance of duty.
  The presumption of causation could be rebutted by  competent  evidence
 to the contrary.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT  ON BENEFITS PAYABLE: Currently, a New York City Deputy Sheriff
 who becomes disabled or dies due to lung disease would be  eligible  for
 an  applicable  ordinary  disability  retirement,  generally  a lifetime
 payment of 1/3 of salary, or a lump sum ordinary death benefit,  respec-
 tively.
  Those  eligible  to receive the performance of duty disability retire-
 ment under the proposed legislation would receive a benefit  similar  to
 the  current  accidental  disability retirement afforded to Deputy Sher-
 iffs.
  The current accidental disability benefit for Tier 4 and Tier 6 NYCERS
 Deputy Sheriff members is equal to:
  * 75% of final average compensation, where
  * the average compensation is computed using five consecutive years of
 wages, less
  * any applicable Workers' Compensation benefit.
  Under the proposed legislation, the  performance  of  duty  disability
 benefit  for  NYCERS  Deputy  Sheriff members who are disabled from lung
 disease would be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  * FAS is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for  Tier  6,
 without
  * an explicit Workers' Compensation offset.
  The ordinary death benefit for Tier 4 and Tier 6 NYCERS Deputy Sheriff
 members  is  a lump sum payment equal to three times the member's salary
 multiplied by the member's years of service, up to a  maximum  of  three
 years.  The  performance  of  duty death benefit is generally equal to a
 lifetime benefit of 50% of a member's wages earned during the last  year
 of service, payable to certain beneficiaries.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  OVERVIEW: There is no data available to estimate
 the number of members and eligible retirees who might develop and become
 disabled or die due to lung disease, and potentially benefit  from  this
 proposed  legislation.  Therefore,  the estimated financial impact has
 been calculated on a per event basis equal to the increase in the  pres-
 ent  value  of  future  employer contributions for an average member who
 could potentially be diagnosed with disabling lung disease and who would
 benefit from the proposed legislation.
  In determining the increase in the present value for members who could
 benefit from the presumption provided by the proposed  legislation  upon
 S. 6253  3
 
 disability,  it  has  been  assumed  that  50% of the members would have
 retired under an Ordinary Disability Retirement (ODR) benefit,  and  the
 remaining  50%  of  members  would have continued working and eventually
 retired for service if the proposed legislation were not passed.
  In determining the increase in the present value for beneficiaries who
 could  benefit from the presumption provided by the proposed legislation
 upon death, it has been assumed that  100%  of  such  members  would  be
 eligible  for an Ordinary Death Benefit if the proposed legislation were
 not passed.
  With respect to an individual member,  the  additional  cost  of  this
 proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's length
 of  service, age, and salary history. In particular, the increase due to
 the proposed legislation would be greater for a member who  is  not  yet
 eligible  for  an  ODR  benefit when the disabling lung disease is diag-
 nosed.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census  data  and  the
 actuarial  assumptions  and  methods  described herein, the enactment of
 this proposed legislation would increase the  present  value  of  future
 employer  contributions  by approximately $426,700, on average, for each
 occurrence of Performance of Duty  Disability  Retirement  due  to  lung
 disease  and $349,000, on average, for each occurrence of Performance of
 Duty Death due to lung disease.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS:  Enactment  of  this
 proposed  legislation  would increase employer contributions, where such
 amount would depend on the number of members affected as well  as  other
 characteristics  including the age, years of service, and salary history
 of each member.
  Based on the actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the
 enactment  of  this proposed legislation is estimated to increase annual
 employer contributions by approximately $50,500 for each Performance  of
 Duty  Disability  Retirement  due  to  lung disease and by approximately
 $41,300 for each Performance of Duty Death due to lung disease.
  As there is no data currently available  to  estimate  the  number  of
 members  who  might be diagnosed with lung disease, the financial impact
 would be recognized at the time of  event.  Consequently,  changes  in
 employer contributions have been estimated assuming that the increase in
 the present value of future employer contributions will be financed over
 a closed 15-year period (14 payments under the One-Year Lag Methodology)
 using level dollar payments.
  With  respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions would
 depend upon when members would retire or die due to  lung  disease  but,
 generally,  increased employer contributions will first occur the second
 fiscal year following approval of the performance of duty disability  or
 death benefit.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  146 NYCERS Deputy Sheriffs as of June 30, 2022 had an average age
 of approximately 42.0  years,  average  service  of  approximately  11.6
 years, and an average salary of approximately $85,700.
  There  are  approximately 34 retired NYCERS Deputy Sheriffs as of June
 30, 2022 who retired between July 1, 2017 and  June  30,  2022  and  are
 receiving  a  pension benefit, other than Accidental Disability or Acci-
 dental Death, and could potentially benefit  from  the  proposed  legis-
 lation.  These  retired members had an average age of approximately 58.5
 years and an average pension benefit of approximately $64,900.

  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
