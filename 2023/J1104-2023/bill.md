  HONORING  Tiger  Jack  Fox  posthumously  upon the
  occasion of being inducted  into  the  International
  Boxing Hall of Fame on June 10-11, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge
outstanding  athletes  who  distinguished  themselves  through  their
exceptional performance, attaining unprecedented success and the highest
level  of  personal achievement; Tiger Jack Fox was one such athlete and
his life of athletic achievements inspired others and contributed to the
respect and admiration of the sport of boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Tiger  Jack  Fox  upon  the  occasion  of  being  inducted  into  the
International Boxing Hall of Fame at Hall of Fame Weekend on June 10-11,
2023 in Canastota, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on April 2, 1907 as John Linwood Fox, Tiger  Jack  Fox
earned the moniker "Tiger Jack" early in his career and it served as his
boxing name; he claimed he got his start in boxing when he was picked up
while  hitchhiking  by heavyweight boxer, Young Stribbling, and received
an offer to serve as a sparring partner; and
 
  WHEREAS, After training under bantamweight champion  Bud  Taylor  in
Terre Haute, Indiana, Tiger Jack Fox went on to become the Indiana State
Heavyweight Champion in 1932; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Affectionately  remembered  as  a  hard  hitting  light
heavyweight, Tiger Jack Fox compiled an overall official record  of  155
wins versus only 22 losses and 12 draws over a 22 year career; his style
consisted  of  keeping  his  hands  at  his side, chin sticking out, and
making faces to entice his opponents to lead so that  he  could  counter
with a blow of his own; and
 
  WHEREAS,  His  most  significant  victories  were  two  over  future
heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, and individual  wins  over  Lou
Brouillard, Maxie Rosenbloom, and former middleweight champion Bob Olin;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tiger Jack Fox ended his career fighting in and around the
Pacific Northwest and retired in Spokane, Washington; he died  on  April
6,  1954 at the age of 47 after suffering a heart attack outside a local
movie theater; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2003, Ring Magazine listed Tiger Jack  Fox  among  their
100 greatest pound-for-pound punchers of all-time; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tiger Jack Fox clearly made a contribution to the spirit of
excellence  which  is  a  tradition  of the International Boxing Hall of
Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of such outstanding athletic accomplishments are brought to
 
our attention, they should be recognized by all  the  citizens  of  this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Tiger Jack Fox upon  the  occasion  of  being  inducted  into  the
International Boxing Hall of Fame on June 10-11, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Tiger Jack Fox.
