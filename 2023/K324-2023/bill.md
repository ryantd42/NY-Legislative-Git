  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 7, 2023, as  Ostomy  Awareness  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official months established to increase awareness of serious issues that
affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim October 7, 2023, as Ostomy Awareness
Day in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  the  observation  of
World Ostomy Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ostomy Awareness Day is held annually on the first Saturday
of  October,  which  coincides with World Ostomy Awareness Day, a health
observance where the world unites every  three  years  to  raise  ostomy
awareness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sponsored  by  the International Ostomy Association, World
Ostomy Awareness Day is meant to raise awareness and increase both state
and national visibility of those living with  ostomies;  in  the  United
States,  the United Ostomy Associations of America, Inc.  (UOAA), is the
leading organization proactively advocating  on  behalf  of  the  ostomy
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  ostomy  is  a  type of surgery that creates an opening
(stoma) in the abdomen which allows for the removal of bodily waste when
a person has lost the normal function of digestive  or  urinary  systems
due  to  birth  defects,  colorectal  cancer,  bladder  cancer,  Crohn's
disease, ulcerative colitis, and other medical conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, An ostomy is also necessary in cases of severe abdominal or
pelvic trauma resulting from  accidents  or  injuries  sustained  during
military service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  bodily  waste passes through the stoma into an ostomy
"pouch" on the outside of the body or in the case of continent diversion
surgeries, an internal surgically created reservoir; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ostomy  is  a  life-saving  and  life-restoring  surgery;
approximately  725,000  to  1  million  Americans  have  an ostomy, with
approximately 100,000 new ostomy procedures performed each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ostomy or continent diversion surgery can occur at any  age
and does not lower life expectancy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Largely  through  the  efforts  of  UOA  and  its over 300
Affiliated  Support  Groups,  Americans  needing  these  surgeries  are
becoming  more  aware  of  the  opportunities for education, mutual aid,
advocacy and support which are such great  benefit  to  them  and  their
families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ostomy Awareness Day was organized to ensure those who are
living with an ostomy face no discrimination and are accepted as normal,
healthy individuals; it is imperative that there be greater awareness of
this serious health  condition,  and  more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity at local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 7, 2023, as Ostomy
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, and to United Ostomy Associations of America, Inc.
