  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the opening paragraph
 of  section  14  of  article 3 of the constitution be amended to read as
 follows:
  No bill shall be passed or become a law  unless  it  shall  have  been
 printed  and  upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least
 three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage,  unless  the
 governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or her
 hand  and  the  seal of the state, the facts which in his or her opinion
 necessitate an immediate vote thereon, in which case it  must  neverthe-
 less  be  upon  the  desks of the members in final form, not necessarily
 printed, before its  final  passage;  nor  shall  any  bill,  EXCEPT  AS
 PROVIDED  IN  THIS  SECTION,  be  passed  or become a law, except by the
 assent of a majority of the members elected to each branch of the legis-
 lature; NOR SHALL ANY BILL WHICH PROVIDES REVENUE TO THE  STATE  OR  ANY
 POLITICAL  SUBDIVISION  THEREOF  IN  A  MANNER THAT IS NON-RECURRING, BE
 PASSED OR BECOME A LAW, EXCEPT  BY  THE  ASSENT  OF  TWO-THIRDS  OF  THE
 MEMBERS ELECTED TO EACH BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE VOTING SEPARATELY; and
 upon  the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereof shall be allowed,
 and the question upon its final passage shall be taken immediately ther-
 eafter, and the ayes and nays entered on the journal.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment  be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
