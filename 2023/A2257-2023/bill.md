  Section 1. Subdivisions 1 and 2 and paragraph (a) of subdivision 5  of
 section 489-cccccc of the real property tax law, as added by chapter 119
 of the laws of 2008, subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 5

 first building permit  THAT  ALLOWS  ACTUAL  CONSTRUCTION  WORK  ON  THE
 PROPOSED  PROJECT,  NOT  MERELY  SITE PREPARATION, TO COMMENCE, or if no
 permit was required, the commencement of construction.  Failure to  meet
 this requirement shall result in termination of any inflation protection
 provided  under  subdivision  three of section four hundred eighty-nine-
 bbbbbb of this title for any tax year that begins following the date  by
 which completion of construction is required under this paragraph.
  (a)  Time  to file. (i) Preliminary application.  (A) Building permit.
 No benefits pursuant to this title shall be granted for any construction
 work unless the applicant filed a preliminary application for such bene-
 fits on or before the date of issuance of the first building permit THAT
 ALLOWS ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION WORK ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT, NOT MERELY SITE
 PREPARATION, TO COMMENCE for such work. This requirement may  be  satis-
 fied where the applicant's architect, contractor or other representative
 authorized  to  file the application for such building permit files with
 the department on behalf of  the  applicant  a  preliminary  application
 containing such information as the department shall prescribe by rule.
  (B)  No  building  permit  required.  Where construction work does not
 require a building permit, a notarized letter from the project's  archi-
 tect  or  engineer  notifying the department of this fact shall be filed
 within thirty calendar days of the commencement  of  construction.  In
 such  circumstance,  such letter shall also satisfy the requirement of a
 preliminary application if the letter contains all  of  the  information
 required  for  a  preliminary  application under rules prescribed by the
 department.
  (ii) Final application. Applicants shall file a final application  for
 benefits  no  later than one year from the date of issuance of the first
 building permit [for construction work] THAT ALLOWS ACTUAL  CONSTRUCTION
 WORK  ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT, NOT MERELY SITE PREPARATION, TO COMMENCE,
 or, where construction work does not require a building permit, no later
 than one year from the date of commencement of  construction.  Abatement
 benefits shall not be granted until the applicant files the final appli-
 cation. If the final application is not filed within such one year peri-
 od,  abatement  benefits  shall not be granted until such application is
 filed, and the department may delay the granting of  such  benefits,  at
 the  department's  discretion,  to  investigate  the reason for the late
 filing.
  (iii) TIME LIMIT; FINAL APPLICATION. Notwithstanding any provision  of
 law  to  the  contrary,  the  time limit to file a final application for
 benefits as specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph  shall  not
 apply  to  brand-new construction from the ground up located on property
 purchased from the city of New York where such  property  which  is  the
 site of the new construction was purchased from the city of New York for
 the  purposes  of  an  eligible development pursuant to this article and
 where the sales agreement with the city of New York  for  such  property
 includes  a restriction preventing the sale or transfer of such property
 for a period of five years or more and where  the  first  valuation  and
 assessment for the purposes of property taxes occurred within that peri-
 od  of  restriction  from  sale,  provided  the  project meets the other
 requirements of this title.
  § 2. This act  shall  take  effect  immediately  and  shall  apply  to
 construction projects that:
  (i)  were delayed as a result of environmental damage due to Hurricane
 Sandy in the fall of 2012; and
  (ii) for which a decision is under contested  review  by  a  court  of
 competent jurisdiction or by the New York City Department of Finance.
