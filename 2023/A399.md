 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to  the  creation  of  an
  animal cruelty and animal fighting database
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. Studies in psychology, sociology  and
 criminology  have  demonstrated  that  violent offenders frequently have
 childhood and adolescent histories of serious and repeated animal cruel-
 ty. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has recognized  this  connection
 since  the  1970s  when  its  analysis  of  the  lives of serial killers
 suggested that most had killed or tortured animals  during  their  life.
 Other  research  has  shown  consistent patterns of animal cruelty among
 perpetrators of more common forms of violence,  including  child  abuse,
 spousal abuse, and elder abuse, leading the American Psychiatric Associ-
 ation  to  consider  animal cruelty as one of the diagnostic criteria of
 conduct disorder.
  § 2. Section 837-w of the executive law, as added by  chapter  219  of
 the  laws  of 2022, is renumbered 837-x and a new section 837-y is added
 to read as follows:
  § 837-Y. ANIMAL CRUELTY DATABASE.  1. THE DIVISION SHALL ESTABLISH AND
 MAINTAIN A CRIME DATABASE OF ALL CONVICTIONS IN NEW YORK STATE OF ANIMAL
 CRUELTY,  ANIMAL  FIGHTING,  ANIMAL  NEGLECT,  ANIMAL  ABANDONMENT,  AND
 MISTREATMENT  OF ANIMALS AS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE TWENTY-SIX OF THE AGRI-
 CULTURE AND MARKETS LAW AND THE PENAL LAW  WHERE  DATA  OF  SUCH  CRIMES
 SHALL  BE  COLLECTED AND DISPLAYED IN A MANNER THAT FACILITATES ANALYSIS
 AND THE  PROTECTION  OF  ANIMALS.  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  THIS  SECTION,
 CONVICTIONS  SHALL  ALSO  INCLUDE  PLEAS  TO  A CHARGE OTHER THAN ANIMAL
 CRUELTY,  ANIMAL  FIGHTING,  ANIMAL  NEGLECT,  ANIMAL  ABANDONMENT,  AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
