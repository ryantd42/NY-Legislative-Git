  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as STOP THE BLEED Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as STOP THE BLEED Month in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
STOP THE BLEED Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trauma  is  the leading cause of death for Americans under
the age of 46; the top cause of preventable death in trauma is bleeding;
20% of people who have died from traumatic injuries could have  survived
with quick bleeding control; 35% of pre-hospital deaths are due to blood
loss; and
 
  WHEREAS,  80% of victims in a mass casualty event are transported to
the hospital by members of the public; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because a trauma victim can  bleed  to  death  within  five
minutes  before professional emergency care arrives, the program teaches
citizens bleeding-control methods developed by the  military  and  first
responders to help citizens become immediate responders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  initiative  was  created in the wake of the 2012 mass
shooting at Sandy  Hook  Elementary  School;  the  American  College  of
Surgeons  convened  senior  health  care  and  public  safety leaders to
produce a program that will improve survival for victims suffering  from
bleeding  injuries,  and their review led to development of the STOP THE
BLEED campaign; and
 
  WHEREAS, When a person is losing blood, every minute counts, and the
STOP THE BLEED campaign of the American College of Surgeons is informing
Americans and connecting Bleeding Control  instructors  with  interested
citizens  throughout  the month of May 2023, and specifically during the
American College of Emergency Physician's EMS  Week,  May  21-27,  2023,
about vital measures to aid trauma victims; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In New York, implementation of the program is being guided
by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and the New York
Chapter of the American College of Surgeons; and
 
  WHEREAS, STOP THE BLEED also provides kits that include  such  tools
as  tourniquets,  dressings,  and  topical  hemostatic  agents  to  help
bystanders offer swift assistance at the scene of  a  mass  casualty  or
other incident; and
 
  WHEREAS, These trauma kits can be affixed to walls in public places,
much  like  the  cardiac defibrillators with which most modern buildings
are furnished; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  STOP THE BLEED campaign is empowering citizens across
the country to save lives in situations when time  is  of  the  absolute
essence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  2023,  as  STOP  THE
BLEED Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National STOP THE BLEED Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
