  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its

State and Nation, sharing deep economic, social, and cultural ties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  August 14 is a national holiday in Pakistan, commemorating

ending centuries of British rule; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  transfer  of  sovereignty  was  the  culmination of a
decades-long Pakistan Movement for independence, with one  of  its  most

and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pakistan Movement had  a  profound  impact  around  the
world, inspiring multiple other independence movements; and

  WHEREAS, The United States is home to the largest Pakistani diaspora
population in the Western Hemisphere, with over half a million people of
Pakistani descent; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pakistanis have a long history in America, beginning in the
nineteenth century with people coming in large numbers from what is  now
Pakistan  to  work  as  laborers,  followed  by  another  major  wave of
immigration starting in the  1960s,  when  the  United  States  reformed
immigration policy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pakistani Americans have made immeasurable contributions to
the  arts,  the STEM fields, business, philanthropy, academics, defense,
sports, religion, and government; and

York City, home to about 50,000  people  of  Pakistani  descent,  living
predominantly in Brooklyn and Queens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pakistani  American  New  Yorkers  have  left an indelible
impression on their city, having increased in number by about 70 percent
in the last decade, with the Pakistani national language of  Urdu  being
one of the most commonly-spoken in the city; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
