 and  performing  groups shall have no more than forty students per class
 at all levels. Each year of the plan, an additional  twenty  percent  of
 the  classrooms in the city school district, excluding special education
 classes,  shall  be  in compliance with the class size targets such that
 the city school district is in full compliance by [two thousand  twenty-
 seven]  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-EIGHT  and all classes should maintain the
 target class size.  The  class  size  reduction  plan  shall  prioritize
 schools serving populations with higher poverty levels.
  (G)  the schools that have made insufficient progress toward achieving
 the class size reduction targets set forth in the  approved  class  size
 reduction  plan  pursuant  to  subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and a
 detailed description of the actions that will be taken to  reduce  class
 sizes in such schools.
  The  report shall be submitted to the commissioner on or before Novem-
 ber fifteenth TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE  AND  ON  OR  BEFORE  NOVEMBER
 FIFTEENTH  of  each  year THEREAFTER and made available to the public by
 such date on the city  school  district's  website.  If  the  department
 determines  that  the  November  fifteenth  report  does not demonstrate
 sufficient decreases in class size, the department shall issue a  letter
 making  that  determination  public  on  its website and the city school
 district shall immediately submit a plan for  corrective  action,  which
 shall be developed in collaboration with the collective bargaining units
 representing  the  teachers  and the principals and signed off on by the
 chancellor and the president of each  collective  bargaining  unit.  The
 city  school district's corrective action plan shall also be made avail-
 able to the public on the city school district's website upon submission
 to the department. The final corrective action plan shall be made avail-
 able to the public upon approval by the  department.  The  report  shall
 also  be certified by the state or city comptroller that the city school
 district's capital and education funding plans will  provide  sufficient
 space  and  staffing  for  the reduction in class size set forth in this
 paragraph and, if not, what measures and/or funding should be  added  to
 the plan to achieve such targets.
  (v)  In addition to the annual reports, the city school district shall
 submit a financial impact statement on November fifteenth, [two thousand
 twenty-four] TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE. The  financial  impact  statement
 may  recommend a pause of the class size reduction plan, but in no event
 may it result in a roll back or increase in class sizes.
