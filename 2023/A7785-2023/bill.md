 AVAILABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE, A RESIDENT OR RESIDENTS MAY SEEK EQUITABLE
 RELIEF FROM A COURT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE APPOINTMENT OF A
 TEMPORARY OPERATOR PURSUANT TO SECTION TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED SIX-A OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW. AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION  SHALL

 encing  serious  financial  instability that is jeopardizing existing or
 continued access to essential services within the community,  or  [(ii)]
 (B) the commissioner finds that there are conditions within the facility
 that  seriously  endanger  the  life,  health  or safety of residents or
 patients, the commissioner may appoint a temporary  operator  to  assume
 sole  control and sole responsibility for the operations of that facili-
 ty, or [(iii)] (C) the commissioner finds that there has been an improp-
 er delegation of management authority  by  the  governing  authority  or
 operator  of a general hospital, the commissioner shall appoint a tempo-
 rary operator to assume sole control and  sole  responsibility  for  the
 operations  of  that  facility;  OR  (II) THE APPOINTMENT OF A TEMPORARY
 OPERATOR IS ORDERED BY THE COURT PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TEN OF  SECTION
 FOUR  HUNDRED  SIXTY-ONE-C  OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW, THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL APPOINT A TEMPORARY OPERATOR  TO  ASSUME  SOLE  CONTROL  AND  SOLE
 RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THAT FACILITY.  The appointment of
 the temporary operator shall be effectuated pursuant to this section and
 shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

 have become a law, provided that the amendments to section 2806-a of the
 public  health law, made by section two of this act shall not affect the
 expiration and repeal of such section and shall  expire  and  be  deemed
 repealed therewith.
