 COVID-19 pandemic has caused an  immediate  financial  crisis  for  many
 homeowners and businesses who may be unable to pay property taxes on the
 prescribed  due  dates and that the imposition of interest at rates well
 above current market rates would hamper recovery of the state's economy.
  § 2. Section 924-a of the real property tax law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 4 to read as follows:

 THOUSAND  TWENTY  TO  JUNE THIRTIETH, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE, SHALL NOT
 EXCEED THREE PERCENT PER ANNUM DURING SUCH PERIOD. ALL OTHER  PROVISIONS
 OF  GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW RELATING TO THE IMPOSITION, COLLECTION
 AND DETERMINATION OF THE RATE OF INTEREST SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED  BY  THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
