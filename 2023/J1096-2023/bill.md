  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Bike Month in the State of New York, in
  conjunction with National Bike Month
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months that are set aside to increase awareness of issues that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is  the  sense  of this Legislative Body
memorialize to Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Bike Month
in the State of New York, in conjunction with National Bike Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, May is National Bike Month,  sponsored  by  the  League  of
American  Bicyclists  and  celebrated in communities coast to coast; New
York and its visitors are encouraged to experience the joys of bicycling
through educational programs, races, commuting events,  charity  events,
or by simply getting out and going for a ride; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1956, Bike Month is a chance to showcase the
many  benefits  of  bicycling  and to encourage more people to give it a
try; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of Bike Month is to support a safe and  healthy
transportation alternative that is paramount to achieving sustainability
and enhancing the quality of life in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  bicycle  is  an  economical, healthy, convenient, and
environmentally sound form of transportation and an excellent  tool  for
recreation and enjoyment of New York State's scenic beauty; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Creating  a bicycling-friendly community has been shown to
improve citizen's health, well-being, and quality of life,  growing  the
economy of New York State, attracting tourism dollars, improving traffic
safety,  supporting  student  learning outcomes, and reducing pollution,
congestion, and wear and tear on our streets and roads; and
 
  WHEREAS, All States require bicyclists on the roadway to follow  the
same  rules  and responsibilities as motorists; there are two main types
of crashes involving bicycles, the most common are falls  and  the  most
serious are with vehicles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2023,  there are so many ways to celebrate Bike Month:
with a commute during Bike to Work Day, biking to coffee or  around  the
block, riding on May 7 for National Ride A Bike Day, and staying safe on
the roadways by following Bike Safety Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bike  Month  promotes  greater public awareness of bicycle
operation and safety  education  in  an  effort  to  reduce  collisions,
injuries,  and  fatalities and improve health and safety for everyone on
the road; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many ways to stay safe while  biking,  including:
always  wear  a  properly-fitted  helmet that meets the Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) standards; check  your  bike  equipment  before
heading  out; ride in the same direction as traffic; obey traffic signs,
signals, and lane markings; signal all turns; and follow local laws; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Motorists are responsible for keeping bikers safe as well,
they should pass bicyclists on the road with care  and  allow  at  least
three  feet  of  clearance, look for cyclists before opening a car door,
pulling out of a parking space, or before making  turns,  and  yield  to
bicyclists at intersections and as directed by signs and signals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is essential that there be greater public awareness of
the benefits to bicycling, and all New Yorkers  are  urged  to  bike  to
work,  or try cycling for fun, for fitness, and for transportation; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Bike Month in
the  State  of New York, in conjunction with National Bike Month; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
