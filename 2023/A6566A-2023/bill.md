 retirement benefit for certain public employees who are above age 55 and
 with 25 years of service provided for in this act is intended only to be
 temporary in nature for employees who are eligible to receive and quali-
 fy for the applicable benefit during the applicable time periods  speci-
 fied  in  this  act.  Further, nothing in this act shall be construed to
 create an expectation of a future or continuing retirement  benefit  for
 any  public  employee who is not eligible to receive and qualify for the
 retirement benefits herein during the applicable time periods.
  § 3. Definitions. As used in this  act,  unless  the  context  clearly

 ers' retirement system, who is an employee of an  educational  employer,
 who holds a position represented by the recognized collective bargaining
 units affiliated with the New York state united teachers employee organ-
 ization  as  certified  by his or her employer, and who has attained the
 age of 55 and has at least 25 years of creditable service in the retire-
 ment system.  For the purposes of this act, the term "eligible employee"

 period; and (iii) the period of time subsequent to the June 2023  school

 shall  not extend beyond August 31, 2023. For the purposes of retirement
 pursuant to this act, a service retirement  application  must  be  filed
 with  the  appropriate  retirement system not less than 14 days prior to
 the effective date of retirement to become effective, unless  a  shorter
 time period is permitted under law.
  (g)  "Commencement  date"  means  the first day the retirement benefit
 mandated by this act shall be made available, which shall mean a date or
 dates on or after the effective date of this act to be determined by the
 educational employer which elects to  participate  pursuant  to  section
 four of this act, but no sooner than June 30, 2023.
  §  4.  On  or after June 30, 2023 an educational employer may elect to
 provide its employees the retirement incentive authorized by this act by
 the adoption of a resolution of its  governing  body.  A  copy  of  such
 resolution  shall  be  filed with the appropriate retirement system. The
 resolution shall be accompanied by the affidavit  of  the  school  board
 president or trustee or other comparable official certifying the validi-
 ty of such resolution.
  § 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any eligible employee
 serving in an eligible title who (a) has been continuously in the active
 service of an educational employer who has elected to participate in the
 retirement  incentive  provided  in section six of this act, pursuant to
 section four of this act, from March 1, 2023  to  the  date  immediately
 prior  to the commencement date of the applicable open period, (b) files
 an application for service retirement that is effective during the  open
 period, and (c) is otherwise eligible for a service retirement as of the
 effective  date  of  the application for retirement shall be entitled to
 the retirement benefit provided in section six of this act.
  § 6. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any eligible employee
 who is: (a) a member of the teachers' retirement system, and  (b)  enti-
 tled  to  retirement  benefits  pursuant to section five of this act may
 retire during the open period  without  the  reduction  of  his  or  her

 of the retirement and social security law if he or she has attained  the
 age  of  55  and  has  completed at least 25 or more years of creditable
 A. 6566  3
 
 service. An eligible employee who is covered by the provisions of  arti-
 cle  11  or  15  of  the retirement and social security law shall retire
 under the provisions of article 11 or 15 of the  retirement  and  social
 security law.
  §  7.  The  pension  benefit costs of section six of this act shall be
 paid by employers as provided  by  applicable  law  for  the  retirement
 system  covered  by  this  act  over  a  period not to exceed five years
 commencing in the state fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.
  § 8. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this act  shall  have
 no  impact  on  retirement incentives, options or inducements offered as
 part of a contractual agreement between  an  eligible  employee  and  an
 educational  employer  which were negotiated prior to the effective date
 of this act.
  § 9. Severability clause.  If any clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdi-
 vision,  section  or  part of this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 10. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide a temporary retirement incentive  to  eligible
 members  of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System during fiscal
 year 2023-2024. This incentive would permit eligible members  to  retire
 without an early retirement reduction upon attainment of at least age 55
 with  25  years of service. Currently attainment of at least age 55 with
 30 years of service, or at least age 62 with five years of  service  are
 required  to retire without reduction for Tiers 2, 3 and 4 members. Tier
 5 members currently must be at least age 57 with 30 years of service, or
 at least age 62 with five years of service to retire without  reduction.
 Finally,  Tier  6  members  are currently required to attain age 63 with
 five years of service to retire without reduction. To receive this bene-
 fit, a member of an employer who has elected to participate must  retire
 during the designated 60-day open period, beginning on or after June 30,
 2023  and not extending beyond August 31, 2023. To be eligible, a member
 must be an employee of an  educational  employer  and  hold  a  position
 represented  by one of the recognized collective bargaining units affil-
 iated with the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT)  as  certified  by
 his  or  her  employer. To participate in this retirement incentive, the
 educational employer must be a school district, a board  of  cooperative
 educational  services,  a  vocational  education and extension board, an
 institution for the instruction of the deaf and of the blind as  enumer-
 ated  in  Section  4201  of  the  Education  Law or a school district as
 enumerated in Section 1 of Chapter 566 of the Laws  of  1967.  Employers
 who  elect to participate would pay the cost of the retirement incentive
 over a period not to exceed five years, beginning in  the  state  fiscal
 year ending March 31, 2025.
  The annual cost, over a five-year period, to the participating employ-
 ers  of  members  of  the New York State Teachers' Retirement System for
 this benefit is estimated to be $54.0 million or  0.29%  of  payroll  if
 this bill is enacted.
