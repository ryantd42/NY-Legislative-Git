 PERCENT OF ALL THE VOTERS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AT THE RECALL ELECTION.
  3.  IF  THE MAJORITY VOTE ON THE QUESTION IS TO RECALL, THE OFFICER IS
 REMOVED AND, IF THERE IS A  CANDIDATE,  THE  CANDIDATE  WHO  RECEIVES  A

 STATE  FOR THE OFFICER'S RECALL ELECTION EXPENSES LEGALLY AND PERSONALLY
 INCURRED. ANOTHER RECALL MAY NOT BE INITIATED AGAINST THE OFFICER  UNTIL
 SIX MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION.
  §  7. THE LEGISLATURE SHALL PROVIDE FOR RECALL OF LOCAL OFFICERS. THIS

 RECALL.

 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
