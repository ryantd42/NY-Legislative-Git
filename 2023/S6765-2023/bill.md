  3. To revoke, cancel or suspend for cause any license or permit issued

 and  sixty-two of this chapter. Any civil penalty so imposed shall be in
 addition to and separate and apart from the terms and provisions of  the
 bond  required  pursuant  to section one hundred twelve of this chapter.
 Provided  that  no  appeal  is  pending  on the imposition of such civil
 penalty, in the event such civil penalty imposed by the division remains
 unpaid, in whole or in part, more than  forty-five  days  after  written
 demand  for  payment has been sent by first class mail to the address of
 the licensed premises, a notice of impending default judgment  shall  be
 sent  by  first  class  mail to the licensed premises and by first class
 mail to the last known home address of the person who  signed  the  most
 recent  license  application.  The  notice of impending default judgment
 shall advise the licensee: (a) that a civil penalty was imposed  on  the
 licensee;  (b)  the  date the penalty was imposed; (c) the amount of the
 civil penalty; (d) the amount of the civil penalty that  remains  unpaid
 as  of  the  date  of the notice; (e) the violations for which the civil
 penalty was imposed; and (f) that a judgment by default will be  entered
 in  the  supreme  court of the county in which the licensed premises are
 located, or other  court  of  civil  jurisdiction  or  any  other  place
 provided  for  the entry of civil judgments within the state of New York
 unless the division receives full payment of  all  civil  penalties  due
 within  twenty days of the date of the notice of impending default judg-
 ment. If full payment shall not have been received by the division with-
 in thirty days of mailing of the notice of impending  default  judgment,
 the  division  shall proceed to enter with such court a statement of the
 default judgment containing the  amount  of  the  penalty  or  penalties
 remaining  due  and unpaid, along with proof of mailing of the notice of
 impending default judgment. The filing of such judgment shall  have  the
 full  force  and  effect  of  a default judgment duly docketed with such
 court pursuant to the civil practice law and  rules  and  shall  in  all
 respects  be  governed  by  that chapter and may be enforced in the same
 manner and with the same effect as that provided by law  in  respect  to
 execution issued against property upon judgments of a court of record. A
 judgment entered pursuant to this subdivision shall remain in full force
 and effect for eight years notwithstanding any other provision of law.
  §  2.  Subdivision  3  of section 17 of the alcoholic beverage control
 law, as amended by section 9 of chapter 522 of  the  laws  of  2018,  is

 dollars as against the holder of any retail permit  issued  pursuant  to

 paragraph f of subdivision one of section ninety-nine-b of this chapter,
 and as against the holder of  any  retail  license  issued  pursuant  to

 sixty-four-c,  seventy-six-f, seventy-nine, eighty-one, and eighty-one-a
 of this chapter, and the sum of thirty thousand dollars as  against  the
 holder  of  a  license  issued  pursuant to sections thirty, thirty-one,
 fifty-three, sixty-one-a, sixty-one-b, SIXTY-ONE-C, seventy-six,  seven-
 ty-six-a  and  seventy-eight  of  this  chapter, provided that the civil
 penalty against the holder of a wholesale  license  issued  pursuant  to

 shall advise the licensee: (a) that a civil penalty was imposed  on  the
 licensee;  (b)  the  date the penalty was imposed; (c) the amount of the
 civil penalty; (d) the amount of the civil penalty that  remains  unpaid
 as  of  the  date  of the notice; (e) the violations for which the civil
 penalty was imposed; and (f) that a judgment by default will be  entered
 in  the  supreme  court of the county in which the licensed premises are
 located, or other court  of  civil  jurisdiction,  or  any  other  place
 provided  for  the entry of civil judgments within the state of New York

 impending default judgment. The filing of such judgment shall  have  the
 full  force  and  effect  of  a default judgment duly docketed with such
 court pursuant to the civil practice law and  rules  and  shall  in  all
 respects  be  governed  by  that chapter and may be enforced in the same
