  COMMEMORATING  the  Finger  Lakes'  community's
  celebration of Lake Friendly Living, May 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing  welfare  of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly
enriched  and  reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors  of
organizations  which  are  committed  to the preservation of our natural
environment and the enhancement of the appreciation of  the  distinctive
features  of  our  surroundings,  and  to the economic well-being of the
areas in which they exist; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the Finger Lakes' community's celebration of  Lake  Friendly
Living, May 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of the New York State Finger Lakes provide clean, safe
drinking  water  for  residents throughout Central New York, and many of
these waterbodies are designated as Class AA(T)  protected  waterbodies;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recent  years,  all of the New York State Finger Lakes
have experienced widespread  harmful  algae  blooms  due,  in  part,  to
nutrients which promote the growth of algae and Cyanobacteria; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Harmful  algae blooms throughout the Finger Lakes threaten
regional water quality and the health and safety of water consumers; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State Finger Lakes'  watershed  organizations  are
looking to advance pollutant reduction strategies through land and water
conservation  recommendations  for residents, operations, and businesses
within their respective watersheds; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lake Friendly Living  Coalition  of  the  Finger  Lakes
offers  conservation  recommendations  for  watershed  residents through
pledge programming, as well as the annual Lake Friendly Living Awareness
Week  intended  to  further  educate  the  public  about  a  variety  of
conservation initiatives being advanced throughout the region; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is incumbent upon all citizens to recognize and applaud
the efforts of organizations such as the Lake Friendly Living  Coalition
of  the  Finger  Lakes which work tirelessly on behalf of protecting our
natural surroundings for the benefit of present and  future  generations
of New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the Finger Lakes' community's celebration of  Lake  Friendly
Living, May 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Lake Friendly Living Collation of the Finger Lakes.
