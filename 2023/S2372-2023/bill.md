  Section  1. Subdivision 7 of section 31 of the private housing finance

 as follows:
  7.  Preference in admission to a project with an open waiting list, as
 determined by the commissioner or the supervising agency, shall be given
 by a mutual company or an urban rental company or by the New York  state
