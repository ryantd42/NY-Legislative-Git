 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The legislature hereby finds and  declares  that  New  York
 state  is  dedicated  to  the mutually compatible goals of environmental
 protection, energy security,  and  economic  growth;  increasing  energy
 efficiency  has been identified as among the most cost-effective methods
 for reducing greenhouse gas and other environmental pollutant  emissions
 and increasing energy security; increasing energy efficiency can lead to
 increased  jobs  and a reduction in building operating expenses; and New
 York state is committed to implementing  new  policies  to  promote  the
 efficient  use  of  energy  and natural resources in the interest of the
 long-term protection and enhancement of the state's environment, economy
 and public health.
