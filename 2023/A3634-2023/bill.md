 Introduced  by M. of A. PRETLOW -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Racing and Wagering
 
 AN ACT to amend the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and  breeding  law,  in
  relation to authorizing interactive gaming
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The  racing,  pari-mutuel  wagering  and  breeding  law  is
 amended by adding a new article 15 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 15
  INTERACTIVE GAMING
 SECTION 1500. LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND FINDINGS.
  1501. DEFINITIONS.
  1502. AUTHORIZATION.
  1503. REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS.
  1504. STATE TAXES.
  §  1500.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND FINDINGS. SECTION NINE OF ARTICLE ONE
 OF THE NEW YORK STATE CONSTITUTION WAS  RECENTLY  AMENDED  AND  PROVIDES
 "CASINO  GAMBLING  AT  NO  MORE  THAN SEVEN FACILITIES AS AUTHORIZED AND
 PRESCRIBED BY THE LEGISLATURE SHALL HEREAFTER BE AUTHORIZED  OR  ALLOWED
 WITHIN  THIS  STATE." IT HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, THE SENSE OF THE
 LEGISLATURE THAT THIS PROVISION IS NOT CONTRAVENED  BY  A  STATUTE  THAT
 AUTHORIZES  THE ACCEPTANCE OF A WAGER BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BETTING BY
 VIRTUAL OR ELECTRONIC MEANS AND THE WAGER IS ACCEPTED THROUGH  EQUIPMENT
 LOCATED  WITHIN A LICENSED GAMING FACILITY; PROVIDED THAT ANY SUCH WAGER
 MEETS OTHER SAFEGUARDS ENSURING THAT THE PLAIN TEXT OF THIS PROVISION IS
 HONORED IN SUCH STRUCTURE. INTERACTIVE GAMING IS  NOW  LEGAL  ONLINE  IN
 SEVEN STATES, INCLUDING THE BORDERING STATES OF NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA
 AND  CONNECTICUT,  WHILE  IT  IS PERMITTED ONLY IN PERSON IN NEW YORK AT
 FOUR UPSTATE COMMERCIAL GAMING FACILITIES AND NATIVE AMERICAN CLASS  III
 GAMING  FACILITIES.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT AN
 INTERACTIVE GAMING WAGER THAT IS  MADE  THROUGH  VIRTUAL  OR  ELECTRONIC
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
