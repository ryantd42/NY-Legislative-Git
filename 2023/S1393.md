 Introduced by Sens. TEDISCO, ORTT -- read twice and ordered printed, and

 AN  ACT  to  amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to requiring
  that license plates be inspected during safety inspections and waiving
  fees for the issuance of certain license plates

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision (c) of section 301 of the vehicle and traffic
 law is amended by adding a new paragraph 4 to read as follows:
  (4) A SAFETY INSPECTION SHALL ALSO INCLUDE A VISUAL INSPECTION OF  THE
 VEHICLE'S  LICENSE PLATES. WHENEVER A LICENSE PLATE SHALL HAVE BECOME SO
 DELAMINATED, OR OTHERWISE DAMAGED OR WORN AS TO BECOME  ILLEGIBLE,  SUCH
 LICENSE  PLATE SHALL NOT MEET THE PROPER AND SAFE CONDITION REQUIREMENTS
 OF SUBDIVISION (A) OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED  FOUR  OF  THIS  ARTICLE.  A
 LICENSE  PLATE  SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE ILLEGIBLE WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE
 LICENSE PLATE'S NUMBERS OR LETTERS CANNOT BE READ BECAUSE: (A) MORE THAN
 ONE-THIRD OF A NUMBER OR LETTER LACKS COLOR DUE TO DELAMINATION OR OTHER
 DAMAGE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FADING; OR (B) THE LICENSE PLATE IS
 MISSING ONE OR MORE PIECES AND SUCH PIECE OR PIECES INCLUDES  MORE  THAN
 ONE-THIRD  OF A NUMBER OR LETTER. THE INCLUSION OF THE VISUAL INSPECTION
 OF A VEHICLE'S LICENSE PLATES IN THE SAFETY INSPECTION PURSUANT  TO  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH  SHALL  NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE
 SAFETY INSPECTION FEE ALLOWED TO BE CHARGED.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 401 of the vehicle and  traffic  law  is
 amended by adding a new paragraph e to read as follows:
  E.  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL WAIVE THE PAYMENT OF FEES REQUIRED BY PARA-
 GRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION IF THE NUMBER LICENSE PLATES APPLIED FOR ARE
 REQUIRED DUE TO A CHANGE IN LICENSE  PLATE  DESIGN,  OR  IF  REPLACEMENT
 LICENSE  PLATES ARE REQUIRED AS THE RESULT OF A FAILED INSPECTION OF THE
 LICENSE PLATES AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH  FOUR  OF  SUBDIVISION  (C)  OF
 SECTION THREE HUNDRED ONE OF THIS CHAPTER. IN BOTH CASES THE OWNER HOLD-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 LICENSE PLATE NUMBER AT NO ADDITIONAL COST.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall have become a law.  Effective immediately the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
