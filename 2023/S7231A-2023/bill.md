  thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The New York state energy research and development authori-
 ty in consultation with the department of public service, the department
 of environmental conservation, Con Edison, the Hudson River Park  Trust,
 other relevant state agencies and authorities with subject matter exper-
 tise, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, is author-
 ized and directed to:
  (a)  develop a study of competitive options to facilitate the electri-
 fication of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal to provide shore power to  all
 vessels docking in the terminal, by the year 2030, while ensuring energy
 resource  adequacy  and  other reliability services are maintained.  The
 study should prioritize the  electrification  of  the  Manhattan  Cruise
 Terminal  to  provide  shore  power  to directly assist in achieving the
 energy, environmental justice and emissions reductions  requirements  of
 section 66-p of the public service law. The study shall address multiple
 types  of shore power plug-ins for vessels and energy pricing rates. The
 study shall include recommendations of standards and requirements that:
  (i) significantly reduce the reliance on  fossil  fuels,  taking  into
 account  the  requirements  and timing of the state's emission reduction
 programs;
  (ii) provide significant environmental, health and other  benefits  to
 disadvantaged communities within one mile of the Manhattan Cruise Termi-
 nal,  as such communities are defined under section 75-0101 of the envi-
 ronmental conservation law; and
  (b) provide public notice of the study, and ensure the results of  the
 study  are  made  easily accessible to members of disadvantaged communi-
 ties, as defined in section 75-0101 of  the  environmental  conservation

 process to facilitate the electrification of the Manhattan Cruise Termi-
 nal maintaining reliability consistent with the recommendations  of  the
 study pursuant to section one of this act.
  §  4.  Upon  installation of shore power capabilities at the Manhattan
 Cruise Terminal, the  department  of  environmental  conservation  shall
