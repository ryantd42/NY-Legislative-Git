  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Autism Acceptance Month in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months and days that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of
important  issues  that  affect the lives of citizens of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Autism
Acceptance  Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with National
Autism Acceptance Month, and World Autism Acceptance Day
 
  WHEREAS, Autism is a spectrum disorder (ASD), defined by  a  certain
set  of  behaviors  and  is  a  "spectrum condition" that affects people
differently and to varying  degrees;  it  is  a  lifelong  developmental
disability  that typically appears during early childhood and can impact
a  person's  social  skills,  communication,  relationships,  and
self-regulation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Autism spectrum disorder affects an estimated 1 in 44 U.S.
children and 1 in 45 U.S. adults and is a complex condition that affects
each person differently, resulting in unique strengths  and  challenges;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  there is currently no known single cause of autism,
early diagnosis helps a person receive the  support  and  services  they
need, which can lead to a quality life filled with opportunity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  autism  impacts  people  regardless  of  race or
ethnicity, there are racial and ethnic disparities in diagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the CDC, ADDM reports have consistently  noted
more  white  children  are  identified  with  ASD than black or Hispanic
children; previous studies have shown that stigma,  lack  of  access  to
healthcare  services  due  to  non-citizenship  or  low-income,  and
non-English  as  primary  language  are  potential  barriers  to  the
identification of children with ASD, especially among Hispanic children;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  boys  are  also  approximately  4.5 times more
likely to have an autism diagnosis than girls of the same age;  however,
recent  research  suggests  girls may not show autism in the same way as
boys and might go undiagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the early 1970s, the Autism Society of America  began  a
nationwide awareness campaign which was adopted by Congress in 1984, and
strengthened by the release of the Autism Awareness ribbon in 1999; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  April  for  the  past  five decades, National Autism
Awareness Month has educated the public about autism and the  challenges
of those within the autism community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  spotlight  shining on autism, as a result, has opened
opportunities for the nation to consider how  to  serve  people  on  the
autism spectrum and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  goal  of Autism Awareness Month was to promote autism
awareness and assure that all affected by autism are able to achieve the
highest quality of life possible, which  has  now  evolved  into  Autism
Acceptance  Month to continue those efforts to spread awareness and also
promote acceptance and ignite change; and
 
  WHEREAS, Those in the autism community still face significant  unmet
needs  and  it  is  imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this health issue, this year we continue our efforts to build  a  better
awareness  of  the  signs,  symptoms,  and realities of autism, and also
provide information and resources for communities to be  more  aware  of
autism,  promote  acceptance,  and be more inclusive in everyday life at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 2023, as Autism
Acceptance Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  National
Autism Acceptance Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
