 AN ACT to amend the public health law and the insurance law, in relation
  to  improper  practices  relating  to staff membership or professional
  privileges of a physician and board certification
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 1 of section 2801-b of the public health law,
 as amended by chapter 605 of the laws of 2008, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. It shall be an improper practice for the governing body of a hospi-
 tal to refuse to act upon an application for staff membership or profes-
 sional  privileges  or to deny or withhold from a physician, podiatrist,
 optometrist, dentist or licensed midwife  staff  membership  or  profes-
 sional  privileges  in  a  hospital, or to exclude or expel a physician,
 podiatrist, optometrist, dentist or licensed midwife from staff  member-
 ship in a hospital or curtail, terminate or diminish in any way a physi-
 cian's,  podiatrist's,  optometrist's,  dentist's  or licensed midwife's
 professional privileges in  a  hospital,  without  stating  the  reasons
 therefor, or if the reasons stated are unrelated to standards of patient
 care,  patient welfare, the objectives of the institution or the charac-
 ter or competency of the applicant. It shall be an improper practice for
 a governing body of a hospital to refuse to act upon an  application  or
 to  deny or to withhold staff membership or professional privileges to a
 PHYSICIAN, podiatrist, OPTOMETRIST, DENTIST, OR LICENSED  MIDWIFE  based
 solely  upon  a  practitioner's  category  of  licensure. IT SHALL BE AN
 IMPROPER PRACTICE FOR A GOVERNING BODY OF A HOSPITAL TO  REFUSE  TO  ACT
 UPON  AN  APPLICATION  OR  TO  DENY  OR  TO WITHHOLD STAFF MEMBERSHIP OR
 PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGES OF A PHYSICIAN WHO WAS  PREVIOUSLY  BOARD-CERTI-
 FIED  AND  WHO HAS NOT MAINTAINED SUCH CERTIFICATION SOLELY BECAUSE SUCH
 PHYSICIAN IS NOT BOARD-CERTIFIED.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  § 2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 4406-d  of  the  public
 health law, as amended by chapter 425 of the laws of 2016, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a)  A  health  care  plan  shall,  upon  request,  make available and
 disclose to health care professionals written application procedures and
 minimum qualification requirements which a health care professional must
 meet in order to be considered by the health care plan. The  plan  shall
 consult with appropriately qualified health care professionals in devel-
 oping  its qualification requirements. A health care plan shall complete
 review of the health care professional's application to  participate  in
 the  in-network  portion  of  the  health care plan's network and shall,
 within sixty days of receiving a health  care  professional's  completed
 application to participate in the health care plan's network, notify the
 health care professional as to: (i) whether [he or she] SUCH HEALTH CARE
 PROFESSIONAL  is credentialed; or (ii) whether additional time is neces-
 sary to make a determination because of a failure of a  third  party  to
 provide necessary documentation. In such instances where additional time
 is necessary because of a lack of necessary documentation, a health plan
 shall  make  every effort to obtain such information as soon as possible
 and shall make a final determination within twenty-one days of receiving
 the necessary documentation. A  HEALTH  CARE  PLAN  MAY  NOT  REFUSE  TO
 APPROVE AN APPLICATION FROM A PHYSICIAN, WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY BOARD-CERTI-
 FIED  AND  WHO  HAS NOT MAINTAINED SUCH CERTIFICATION, TO PARTICIPATE IN
 THE IN-NETWORK PORTION OF THE HEALTH CARE PLAN'S NETWORK SOLELY  BECAUSE
 SUCH PHYSICIAN IS NOT BOARD-CERTIFIED.
  §  3.  Paragraph  1 of subsection (a) of section 4803 of the insurance
 law, as amended by chapter 425 of the laws of 2016, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  (1)  An  insurer  which  offers  a  managed  care  product shall, upon
 request, make available and disclose to health care professionals  writ-
 ten  application procedures and minimum qualification requirements which
 a health care professional must meet in order to be  considered  by  the
 insurer  for  participation  in  the  in-network benefits portion of the
 insurer's network for  the  managed  care  product.  The  insurer  shall
 consult with appropriately qualified health care professionals in devel-
 oping its qualification requirements for participation in the in-network
 benefits  portion of the insurer's network for the managed care product.
 An insurer shall complete  review  of  the  health  care  professional's
 application  to  participate  in the in-network portion of the insurer's
 network and, within sixty days of receiving a health care professional's
 completed application to participate  in  the  insurer's  network,  will
 notify  the health care professional as to: (A) whether [he or she] SUCH
 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL is credentialed; or (B) whether additional time
 is necessary to make a determination because of a  failure  of  a  third
 party  to provide necessary documentation. In such instances where addi-
 tional time is necessary because of a lack of  necessary  documentation,
 an insurer shall make every effort to obtain such information as soon as
 possible  and shall make a final determination within twenty-one days of
 receiving the necessary documentation. AN  INSURER  MAY  NOT  REFUSE  TO
 APPROVE AN APPLICATION FROM A PHYSICIAN, WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY BOARD-CERTI-
 FIED AND WHO HAS NOT MAINTAINED SUCH CERTIFICATION, FOR PARTICIPATION IN
 THE  IN-NETWORK  PORTION  OF  THE  INSURER'S NETWORK SOLELY BECAUSE SUCH
 PHYSICIAN IS NOT BOARD-CERTIFIED.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
