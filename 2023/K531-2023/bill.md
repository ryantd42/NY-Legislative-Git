  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 6, 2023, as Coaches Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to acknowledge the role  and  value  of
coaches  and  to thank them for being instrumental to the development of
children throughout the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  6,  2023,  as
Coaches Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Coaches Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  September  19,  1972,  President  Richard Nixon signed
Proclamation 4157 establishing  October  6  of  each  year  as  National
Coaches Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  creation  of  National  Coaches  Day  came  at a very
significant time for sports  in  America;  title  ix  of  the  education
amendments  had  been  signed into law only three months earlier and the
Association for  Intercollegiate  Athletics  for  Women  had  just  been
formalized  to  conduct national championships in women's college sports
for its 280 member institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The triumphs and the tragedies of the 1972 Summer  Olympics
were  still  very  fresh in the collective mind of the country; however,
President Nixon's words did not focus exclusively on elite athletes  and
coaches;  he  acknowledged  that  the  majority  of  coaches  take their
satisfaction from the achievements of others as well as  made  the  case
that  a  coach's role is greater than simply medals and scoreboard wins;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of those who participate in  organized  sports  become
better  citizens  because  of  the  lessons they have learned from their
coaches and because of the example which  their  coaches  have  set  for
them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, millions of coaches serve as those examples for tens
of  millions  of  athletes  across  the United States; the importance of
well-trained coaches is clearer now than at almost any other time in our
history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coaches Day recognizes the men  and  women  who  serve  the
athletes  of  this  Nation as well as recognizes those organizations and
institutions that are committed to preparing coaches to provide not only
the technical and tactical knowledge required to coach a sport, but also
the interpersonal skills to teach the valuable life lessons of which our
future as a Nation depends; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, Coaches Day celebrates a coach that has had  a
positive  impact  on you, your child, or your community and supports the
 
push for quality coaches and the institutions that are committed to this
goal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by
individuals  for  the  benefit  of  others  which  coaches  across  all
disciplines  throughout  the State of New York have displayed throughout
their lives; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  6, 2023, as
Coaches Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
