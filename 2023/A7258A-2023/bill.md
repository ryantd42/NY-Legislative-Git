  2.  Transportation  expense.  The transportation expense of each child
 with a [handicapping condition] DISABILITY shall be aidable  in  accord-
 ance  with  subdivision  seven of section thirty-six hundred two of this
 chapter; provided, however, that for the  school  year  commencing  July

 tioned ninety per centum of the estimated amount of its  approved  costs
 of  such  year  for  the  transportation  of children with [handicapping
 conditions] DISABILITIES  whose  transportation  was  formerly  provided
 under a family court order and is now a charge upon the school district,
 subject  to  the  adjustment  of  any  errors after the actual costs are
 ascertained.
  3. Computing state financial responsibility for operating expenses for
 certain children with [handicapping conditions] DISABILITIES.
  a. In addition to any other apportionments  under  the  provisions  of
 this  chapter,  there  shall  be  apportioned  to each applicable school
 district for each child with a [handicapping  condition]  DISABILITY  in
 attendance  in  a  state  school  under the provisions of paragraph d of
 subdivision two of section forty-four hundred one of this article or  an
 approved  program under the provisions of paragraphs e, f, g, h, i and l
 of such subdivision two, the product of  such  attendance,  computed  in
 accordance  with  regulations  of  the commissioner, and the excess cost
 aid: an amount computed by multiplying the excess cost,  as  defined  in
 subdivision six of section forty-four hundred one of this article by the
 excess cost aid ratio defined in subdivision seven of this section.
  b.  In  addition  to  the  apportionment provided to a school district
 pursuant to paragraph a of this subdivision  for  the  attendance  of  a
 child with a [handicapping condition] DISABILITY in a state school under
 the  provisions  of paragraph d of subdivision two of section forty-four
 hundred one of this article, for each such child in attendance  in  such
 school  prior  to  July  first,  nineteen hundred ninety, there shall be
 apportioned an additional amount. Such amount shall equal the product of
 the taper aidable cost multiplied by the  taper  aid  ratio.  The  taper
 aidable  cost  shall equal the positive remainder resulting when (i) the
 apportionment attributable to such child pursuant to paragraph a of this
 subdivision is subtracted from (ii) the product of such child's  attend-
 ance  and the tuition for the state school such child attends. The taper
 aid ratio shall equal the quotient, computed to three  decimals  without
 rounding,  resulting  when  the  positive  remainder  of  one  minus the
 combined wealth ratio, as defined in subdivision [one] THREE of  section
 thirty-six  hundred  two of this chapter is divided by seventy-five one-
 hundredths. Such aid ratio shall not be less than  zero  nor  more  than
 one.
  c.  The apportionments to each school district pursuant to this subdi-
 vision shall be based on excess cost paid and attendance during the base
 year.
  d. Notwithstanding sections thirty-six hundred  seven  and  thirty-six
 hundred nine-a of this chapter, apportionments pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion  shall  be  paid  to school districts upon submission of reports of
 attendance  and  approved  tuition  expenditures  filed  in  a  format
 prescribed  by the commissioner and shall be paid from the annual appor-
 tionment of public moneys for the support of public schools  in  accord-
 ance with section thirty-six hundred nine-b of this chapter.
 A. 7258--A  6
 
  5.  The commissioner shall annually determine the tuition rate and the
 commissioner of social services shall annually determine the maintenance
 rate for special services or programs provided during the months of July
 and August for  children  with  [handicapping  conditions]  DISABILITIES
 entitled  to attend public schools without the payment of tuition pursu-
 ant to section thirty-two hundred two of this chapter.  The commissioner
 of education shall annually determine the tuition rate, maintenance rate
 and the medical services rate, if applicable, for such children  attend-
 ing the New York state school for the blind or the New York state school
 for  the  deaf during the months of July and August. Such rates shall be
 determined in conformance with the  reimbursement  methodologies  estab-
 lished pursuant to subdivision four of this section and shall be subject
 to the approval of the division of the budget. Rates shall be determined
 for  all  special  services or programs as defined in section forty-four
 hundred one of this chapter and offered during July and August.

  1. When the family court pursuant to section two hundred thirty-six of
 the family court act shall issue an order  to  provide  for  educational
 services, including transportation, tuition or maintenance of such chil-

 education], if he approves such order, shall issue a certificate to such
 effect in duplicate, one of which shall be filed with the clerk  of  the
 board  of  supervisors or other governing elective body of the county or
 chief fiscal officer of the city of New York and one in  the  office  of
 the  commissioner [of education]. Refusal of the commissioner to approve
 such order may be reviewed only in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
 article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
  2.  One-half  of  the  cost of providing such services, as provided in
 subdivision one of this section, as certified by  the  commissioner  [of
 education],  is  hereby  made a charge against the county or the city of
 New York  in  which  any  such  [handicapped]  child  WITH  DISABILITIES
 resides, and the remaining one-half of the cost thereof shall be paid by
 the  state  out of moneys appropriated therefor. All claims for services
 rendered and for supplies furnished and for other expenses  incurred  in
 providing  such  services,  shall  be  paid in the first instance by the
 board of supervisors or other governing elective body of the  county  or
 chief fiscal officer of the city of New York in which such [handicapped]
 child  WITH DISABILITIES resides, upon vouchers presented and audited in
 the same manner as in the case of other claims against the county or the
 city of New York.
  4. The commissioner is hereby authorized after  consultation  with  an
 advisory  task  force to be appointed by the commissioner, appropriately
 representative of consumers and providers of such services, to establish
 program and expenditure guidelines and standards for  the  provision  of
 special  services  or  programs as defined in section forty-four hundred
 one of this article for children with [handicapping conditions] DISABIL-
 ITIES who are under the age of five  and  are  not  entitled  to  attend

 of  such  services  or  programs  within their respective county or city
 ordered by the family court pursuant to section two  hundred  thirty-six
 of  the  family  court act for preschool age children with [handicapping
 conditions] DISABILITIES.
 A. 7258--A  7
 
  b. Payments made pursuant to this section by the county or the city of
 New York shall, upon the conclusion of the July first to June  thirtieth
 school year for which such payment was made, be subject to audit against
 the  actual  difference  between such audited expenditures and revenues.
 Any  overpayments  made shall be refunded to such county or city or such
 county or city shall withhold the amount of such  overpayment  from  any
 other payments due to the claimant and shall report such overpayments to
 the commissioner.
  §  10.  The  section  heading and subdivision 1 of section 4407 of the
 education law, the section heading as amended by chapter 53 of the  laws
 of  1986, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 82 of the laws of 1985 and

 the satisfaction of the department that a  child  with  a  [handicapping
 condition]  DISABILITY is not receiving instruction because there are no
 appropriate public or private facilities for instruction of such a child
 within this state because of the unusual type of the [handicap] DISABIL-
 ITY or combination of  [handicaps]  DISABILITIES  as  certified  by  the
 commissioner, the school district of which each such pupil is a resident
 is  authorized  to contract with an educational facility located outside
 the state, which, in the judgment of the department, can meet the  needs
 of  such  child  for  instruction.  Contracts,  rates,  payments  and
 reimbursements pursuant to this section  shall  be  in  accordance  with
 section forty-four hundred five of this article.
  §  11. The section heading, paragraphs a, b and d of subdivision 4 and

 follows:

  a. The board shall identify each preschool child suspected of having a
 [handicapping condition] DISABILITY who resides within the district and,
 upon referral to the committee shall, with the consent  of  the  parent,
 provide  for  an  evaluation  related to the suspected disability of the
 child. The board shall make such identification in accordance with regu-
 lations of the commissioner.
  b. Each board shall, within time limits established by the commission-
 er, be responsible  for  providing  the  parent  of  a  preschool  child
 suspected of having a [handicapping condition] DISABILITY with a list of
 approved  evaluators  in  the geographic area. The parent may select the
 evaluator from such list.  Each board shall provide for dissemination of
 the list and other information to parents at appropriate sites including
 but not limited to pre-kindergarten, day care, head start  programs  and
 early  childhood  direction  centers,  pursuant  to  regulations  of the
 commissioner.
  d. The approved evaluator shall, following completion  of  the  evalu-
 ation,  transmit  the  documentation of the evaluation to all members of
 the committee and to a person designated by the  municipality  in  which
 the preschool child resides. Each municipality shall notify the approved
 evaluators  in  the  geographic  area  of  the person so designated. The
 summary report of the evaluation shall be  transmitted  in  English  and

 dominant  language  or other mode of communication of the parent, unless
 not clearly feasible to do so pursuant to regulations promulgated by the
 commissioner. Costs of translating the summary report and  documentation
 of the evaluation shall be separately reimbursed. If, based on the eval-
 uation,  the committee finds that a child has a [handicapping condition]

 to  develop an individualized education program for the preschool child.
 Nothing herein shall prohibit an approved evaluator  from  at  any  time
 providing  the parent with a copy of the documentation of the evaluation
 provided to the committee.
  a. The committee shall review all relevant information, including  but
 not limited to:
  (i)  information  presented  by  the parent and the child's teacher or
 teachers pertinent to each child suspected  of  having  a  [handicapping
 condition] DISABILITY;
  (ii) the results of all evaluations; and
  (iii)  information  provided  by the appropriate licensed or certified
 professional designated by the agency that is charged with the responsi-
 bility for the child pursuant to applicable federal laws, if any.

 school  district  of current location of a foster care or homeless child
 or child in residential care shall be responsible for the evaluation and
 placement procedures prescribed  for  a  preschool  child  suspected  of
