 AN ACT to amend the state finance law, in relation  to  providing  state

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  state finance law is amended by adding a new section
 54-n to read as follows:
  § 54-N. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOST TAX REVENUE DUE TO TOXIC CONTAMINATION.
 1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "MUNICIPALITY" SHALL MEAN ANY CITY, VILLAGE,
 TOWN OR FIRE DISTRICT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER.
  2. ANY MUNICIPALITY SUBJECT TO CONTAMINATION EITHER DIRECTLY OR  INDI-
 RECTLY  FROM  THE  STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE KNOWN AS THE DEWEY LOEFFEL
 LANDFILL, THAT HAS REDUCED ITS TAX LEVY ON PROPERTIES AFFECTED  BY  SUCH
 HAZARDOUS  WASTE  SITE, SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF SUCH LOST
 TAX REVENUE BY THE STATE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "LOST TAX REVEN-
 UE" SHALL MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL VALUATION OF SUCH  REAL
 PROPERTY  AND  THE REDUCED ASSESSED VALUE DUE TO CONTAMINATION AS CERTI-
 FIED BY THE CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER OF THE MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH SUCH PROP-
 ERTIES ARE LOCATED.
  3. SUCH REIMBURSEMENT SHALL  BE  MADE  ANNUALLY  TO  THE  MUNICIPALITY
 FOLLOWING APPLICATION BY THE CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER OF THE MUNICIPALITY TO
 THE COMPTROLLER IN A MANNER APPROVED AND PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPTROLLER.
  4.  SUCH SYSTEM OF REIMBURSEMENT SHALL CONTINUE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE
 DEWEY LOEFFEL LANDFILL HAS BEEN REMOVED  FROM  THE  INVENTORY  OF  STATE
 HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
