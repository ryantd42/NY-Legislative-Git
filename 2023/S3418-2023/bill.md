 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to requiring a weekly

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 2 of section 278 of the public health law, as
 renumbered by section 1-a of part B of chapter 447 of the laws  of  2012
 and  as  amended  by  section  16 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws of
 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  2. The department shall extract  pharmacy  retail  price  information,
 showing the actual price to be paid to the pharmacy by a retail purchas-
 er  for  any  listed drug at the listed dosage, from usual and customary
 price data collected by the medical assistance program under title elev-
 en of article five of the social services law. Provided,  however,  that
 any  pharmacy  participating  in  the  medical  assistance program shall
 provide the usual and customary price data for  the  one  hundred  fifty
 most frequently prescribed drugs under section sixty-eight hundred twen-
 ty-six of the education law to the department through the same mechanism
 that  the  usual  and customary price data is received under the medical
 assistance program. If the department is unable to  process  such  data,
 the  pharmacy shall fax or electronically transmit to the department the
 usual and customary price data for the one hundred fifty most frequently
 prescribed drugs under section sixty-eight  hundred  twenty-six  of  the
 education law. The prescription drug retail price list database shall be
 subject  to  and conform with applicable state and federal requirements,
 including those concerning privacy, confidentiality and use of  informa-
 tion.  The  commissioner  shall seek a waiver of any federal requirement
 necessary for development and implementation of the database under  this
 section. Upon implementation of this system, this section shall apply in
 place of any inconsistent provision of section sixty-eight hundred twen-

 ty-six  of  the  education  law. The prescription drug retail price list
 database on the department's  website  shall  list  a  pharmacy's  price
 information  extracted  under  this subdivision as the pharmacy's retail
 price  for  each drug. The department shall update the prescription drug
 retail price list at least weekly using the most recent retail price for
 each drug for each pharmacy [as reasonably practicable].
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
