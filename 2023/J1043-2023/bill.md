family, friends, and the community at large loyally and enthusiastically
supported the Vikings throughout  their  journey  as  they  ended  their

the sixth year in a row; and
 
  WHEREAS, In a sport such as competitive cheerleading, which  demands
athletic  prowess,  strength and agility, Head Coach Lisa Ferrari worked

outstanding athletes lessons which will prove invaluable both on and off
the mat; and
 
  WHEREAS, Head Coach Lisa Ferrari and all of the outstanding athletes
