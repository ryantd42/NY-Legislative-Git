  HONORING  ex-Chief  Timothy  P.  Farrell  upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  many  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
  Albertson Volunteer Fire Company
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  ex-Chief
Timothy  P.  Farrell  upon  the  occasion of his designation for special
recognition after many years  of  dedicated  service  to  the  Albertson
Volunteer  Fire  Company  to  be  celebrated at its Annual Dinner at the
Royalton on Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Roslyn Heights, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Timothy P. Farrell has consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  member  of  the  Albertson Volunteer Fire Company since
April 8, 2013, ex-Chief Timothy P. Farrell diligently climbed the  ranks
throughout  his  years  serving to eventually be named Chief in 2022; he
previously held roles of Lieutenant of Rescue in 2014, Captain of Rescue
in 2015, Captain in 2016-2017, Second Assistant Chief in 2019, and First
Assistant Chief in 2020-2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, With him throughout have been his fellow volunteer  members
who  risk their lives for the greater good of the community and who have
all shown him love and support and rejoice in his many achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Timothy  P.  Farrell  is  such  a  firefighter;  throughout his years of
devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above  and  beyond
the  call  of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  ex-Chief  Timothy P. Farrell upon the occasion of his designation
 
for special recognition after many years of  dedicated  service  to  the
Albertson Volunteer Fire Company; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ex-Chief Timothy P. Farrell.
