 a home improvement, in reliance on false or fraudulent written represen-
 tations or false written statements,  may  sue  and  recover  from  such
 contractor a penalty of [five hundred] ONE THOUSAND dollars plus reason-
 able  attorney's fees, in addition to any damages sustained by the owner

  § 7. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 2 of section 155.05 of the penal law

 scheme to defraud, he obtains property of another by means of  a  repre-
 sentation,  express  or  implied,  that he or a third person will in the
 future engage in particular conduct, and when  he  does  not  intend  to
 engage in such conduct or, as the case may be, does not believe that the
 third person intends to engage in such conduct.
  In any prosecution for larceny based upon a false promise, the defend-
 ant's  intention  or  belief that the promise would not be performed may
 not be established by or inferred from the fact alone that such  promise
 was not performed. Such a finding may be based only upon evidence estab-
 lishing that the facts and circumstances of the case are wholly consist-
 ent  with  guilty intent or belief and wholly inconsistent with innocent
 intent or belief, and excluding to a moral  certainty  every  hypothesis
 except  that  of  the  defendant's  intention or belief that the promise
 would not be performed;
