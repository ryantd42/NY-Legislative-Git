  SUMMARY:  This  proposed  legislation would permit Ryan D. O'Connor, a
 vested Tier 6 member of the New York City EmployeesÆ  Retirement  System
 (NYCERS), to elect, by filing an application with NYCERS within one year
 of the effective date, membership in the Tier 4 NYCERS 57/5 Plan.

  Since Mr. O'Connor is a deferred vested member and  therefore  has  no
 remaining  working  lifetime,  the  entire  increase in Unfunded Accrued
 Liabilities would be recognized immediately.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Term. Vested Members
  - Number Count:  1
  - Average Age:  37

  BACKGROUND:  Mr.  O'Connor commenced employment with the New York City
 Transit Authority on January 19, 2012 and subsequently joined NYCERS  in
 September 2012. In the nine-month period between the commencement of his
 employment  and  the  date  on which he joined NYCERS, Chapter 18 of the
 Laws of 2012, or Tier 6, was enacted.  Therefore, Mr.  O'Connor  joined
 NYCERS  as  a  Tier  6  member. The proposed legislation would allow Mr.
 O'Connor to apply for a retroactive NYCERS membership  date  of  January
 19, 2012, which would entitle him to Tier 4 membership, without a refund
 of past Tier 6 contributions, in the NYCERS 57/5 Plan.
  A  change  from  Tier  6  to Tier 4 would result in an earlier date of
 retirement eligibility, lower overall prospective employee  contribution
 rates,  a  larger  benefit, and a three-year (as opposed to a five-year)
 final average salary.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  Per the proposed legislation, Mr. O'Connor is currently a Metropolitan
 Transportation Authority (MTA) Metro-North employee. For the purposes of
 this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  Mr.  O'Connor  will  transfer  his
 NYCERS  membership  to his pension plan at the MTA.  Therefore, the cost
 reflected in this Fiscal Note is based on the additional  reserves  that
 will  be required to be transferred from NYCERS, considering Chapter 717
 of the Laws of 2023.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).  This Fiscal Note does not reflect any chapter
 laws that may have been enacted during the current legislative session.
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: Marek Tyszkiewicz and Gregory Zelikov-
 sky are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy  of
 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy  of  Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
 To the best of our knowledge, the results  contained  herein  have  been
 prepared  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and
 procedures and with the Actuarial Standards of Practice  issued  by  the
 Actuarial Standards Board.
