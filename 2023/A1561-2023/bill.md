  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 9 of section 730.10 of the criminal procedure
 law, as added by section 1 of part Q of chapter 56 of the laws of  2012,
 is amended to read as follows:
  9.  "Appropriate  institution"  means:  (a) a hospital operated by the
 office of mental health or a developmental center operated by the office
 for people with developmental disabilities; or (b) a  hospital  licensed
 by  the  department of health which operates a psychiatric unit licensed
 by the office of  mental  health,  as  determined  by  the  commissioner
 provided,  however,  that  any such hospital that is not operated by the
 state shall qualify as an "appropriate institution" only pursuant to the
 terms of an agreement between the  commissioner  and  the  hospital,  OR
 BETWEEN  THE COMMISSIONER AND A JAIL-BASED FACILITY PURSUANT TO SUBDIVI-
 SION SEVEN OF SECTION 730.60 OF THIS ARTICLE.  Nothing in  this  article
 shall  be construed as requiring a hospital to consent to providing care
 and treatment to an incapacitated person at such hospital.
  § 2.  Subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 730.60 of the criminal procedure
 law, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 231 of the  laws  of  2008  and
 subdivision  2 as amended by chapter 57 of the laws of 1984, are amended
 and a new subdivision 7 is added to read as follows:
  1. When a local criminal court issues a final or  temporary  order  of
 observation  or an order of commitment, it must forward such order and a
 copy of the examination reports and the  accusatory  instrument  to  the
 commissioner, and, if available, a copy of the pre-sentence report. Upon

 receipt thereof, the commissioner must designate an appropriate institu-
 tion  operated  by  the  department of mental hygiene, OR A COUNTY JAIL-
 BASED COMPETENCY RESTORATION PROGRAM PURSUANT TO  SUBDIVISION  SEVEN  OF
 THIS SECTION, in which the defendant is to be placed, provided, however,
 that  the  commissioner may designate an appropriate hospital for place-
 ment of a defendant for whom a  final  order  of  observation  has  been
 issued,  where  such hospital is licensed by the office of mental health
 and has agreed to accept, upon referral by the commissioner,  defendants
 subject  to  final  orders of observation issued under this subdivision.
 The sheriff must hold the defendant in custody pending such  designation
 by  the  commissioner, and when notified of the designation, the sheriff
 must deliver the defendant to the superintendent  of  such  institution.
 The  superintendent must promptly inform the appropriate director of the
 mental hygiene legal service of the defendant's admission to such insti-
 tution. If a defendant escapes from the custody of the commissioner, the
 escape shall interrupt the period prescribed in any  order  of  observa-
 tion,  commitment  or  retention,  and  such interruption shall continue
 until the defendant is returned to the custody of the commissioner.
  2. Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions four and five OF  THIS
 SECTION, when a defendant is in the custody of the commissioner pursuant
 to  a  temporary  order  of  observation or an order of commitment or an
 order of  retention,  OR  A  COUNTY  JAIL-BASED  COMPETENCY  RESTORATION
 PROGRAM  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  SEVEN  OF THIS SECTION, the criminal
 action pending against the defendant in the court that issued such order
 is suspended until the superintendent of the institution  in  which  the
 defendant is confined OR A CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST FOR A COUNTY JAIL-BASED
 COMPETENCY  RESTORATION  PROGRAM  PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION SEVEN OF THIS
 SECTION determines that he is no longer an incapacitated person. In that
 event, the court that issued such order  and  the  appropriate  district
 attorney  must  be  notified,  in  writing, by the superintendent of his
 determination. The court must thereupon proceed in accordance  with  the
 provisions  of subdivision two of section 730.30 of this [chapter] ARTI-
 CLE; provided, however, if the court is  satisfied  that  the  defendant
 remains  an  incapacitated  person, and upon consent of all parties, the
 court may order the return of the defendant to the institution in  which
 he  had  been  confined for such period of time as was authorized by the
 prior order of commitment or order of retention. Upon such  return,  the
 defendant  shall  have  all  rights  and  privileges  accorded  by  the
 provisions of this article.
