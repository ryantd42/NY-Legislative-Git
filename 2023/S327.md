  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for
 the purposes of determining if a provider can  evince  severe  financial
 distress  as outlined by chapter 53 of the laws of 2022 making appropri-
 ations for the support of government, the  department  of  health  shall
 consider  criteria  including  but  not limited to a general hospital as
 defined by section 2801 of the public  health  law  that:  (a)  has  two
 months, or less, worth of reserves to cover anticipated expenses; (b) is
 an  enhanced  safety  net  hospital  as defined by section 2807-c of the
 public health law; (c) is at risk of defaulting on existing  debt  obli-
 gations; or (d) needs to undergo a major capital improvement in order to
 maintain  existing  services  that  the  general  hospital cannot obtain
 financing for and does not have reserves to cover the cost of such capi-
 tal improvement.
  § 2.  This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the
 same  manner  as  chapter 53 of the laws of 2022 making appropriations
 for the support of government, takes effect.
