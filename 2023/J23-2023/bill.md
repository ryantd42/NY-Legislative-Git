  HONORING  Osprey's  Dominion  upon the occasion of
  its designation as a Gold Medalist by the  New  York
  Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Osprey's  Dominion  upon  the  occasion  of  its  designation  as a Gold
Medalist by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation at  its  36th  Annual
New York Wine Classic on Tuesday, July 12, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  36th  Annual  New  York  Wine Classic is a nationally
recognized competition highlighting the best of New York's wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years  and
allowing  wine  enthusiasts  to  enjoy  this unique part of the New York
experience across the  state,  this  extraordinary  vineyard  has  truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS, Osprey's Dominion was awarded for its 2013 Reserve, Merlot;
2014  Merlot;  2015 Cabernet Franc, Platinum Medal, Best Cabernet Franc;
2015 Cabernet Sauvignon; 2015 Flight Meritage, Best Red Blend  Vinifera;
2015 Reserve, Merlot; and 2020 Reserve, Pinot Gris; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ninety acres of vinifera grapes grow under the watchful eye
of the soaring Osprey, the vineyard's namesake; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Long Island wine region is located at approximately the
same  latitude  as  the  great  wine-growing regions of France; Osprey's
Dominion's location (being surrounded, yet sheltered, by both  the  Long
Island  Sound  and Peconic Bay), and the complexity of the farming soil,
contributes significantly to the quality and character  of  its  grapes,
and hence, its wines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  true  to  its  philosophy,  Osprey's  Dominion
produces the best wines with the least interference  from  humankind  to
please the most discerning palates; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, its 'Reserve' wines are produced only in those
years  when  the  right  conditions  of sun and rain can produce a truly
great wine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history, this esteemed vineyard  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Osprey's Dominion is in  direct  correlation
to  the efforts of its dedicated owners and staff, whose involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
 
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of  the  businesses  and  the  communities  they
serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident it will  continue  to  enjoy  the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Osprey's Dominion upon the occasion of its designation as  a  Gold
Medalist by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation on July 12, 2022; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Osprey's Dominion.
