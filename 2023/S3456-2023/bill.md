 Except as otherwise provided by sections one hundred  one,  two  hundred

 corporation  or political subdivision, or out of any fund established by

 and while such person is receiving  any  salary  or  emolument  therefor
 except  reimbursement for traveling expenses. [Notwithstanding the fore-

 date he or she vacates such elective public office,  unless  the  amount
 earned  for  any  calendar year for that elective public office does not
 exceed  the  earning  limitation provided for retired persons in section

 elective public office from which he or she retired].
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately, and shall  apply  to  all
 current elected officials and all those elected after the effective date
