 to read as follows:
  The authority is further authorized, as deemed feasible and  advisable
 by  the  trustees,  to  acquire,  maintain, manage, operate, improve and
 reconstruct as a project or projects of the authority one or both of the
 steam generation facilities owned by the state  known  as  the  Sheridan
 [avenue] AVENUE steam [generating] plant [on Sheridan avenue in the city
 of  Albany  and used to supply steam to state facilities], together with
 any properties, buildings and equipment at the sites thereof  or  ancil-
 lary  thereto,  for  the  generation  and sale of thermal energy and the
 cogeneration and sale of electricity for use by facilities of the  state
 within  the  county  of Albany. All the authority's costs, including its
 acquisition, capital, operating and maintenance costs, shall  be  recov-
 ered  fully  from  the  customers receiving service from such project or
 projects. Thermal energy and electricity not required by the  state  may
 S. 2689  5
 
 be  sold  by the authority to others. The authority is not authorized to
 use refuse or refuse-derived fuel in operating the project or  projects.
 AS  OF  THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF
 SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FOUR  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW, ALL OF THE ENERGY,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HEAT, COOLING AND ELECTRICITY, PRODUCED  AT
 THE  SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT SHALL UTILIZE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS.
 Any agreement for such acquisition shall insure that  the  authority  is
 not  liable  or otherwise responsible for circumstances arising from the
 prior operation of such facilities. The acquisition and purchase of such
 land, buildings and equipment by the authority, and any actions taken to
 effect such  acquisition  and  purchase,  are  hereby  exempt  from  the
 provisions  of  article eight of the environmental conservation law. The
 application of such exemption shall be strictly limited to the  acquisi-
 tion and purchase of such land, buildings and equipment by the authority
 and  such  agreements  with  the  state. Nothing herein shall exempt the
 authority from  otherwise  applicable  laws  respecting  the  expansion,
 conversion, operation and maintenance of such land, buildings and equip-
 ment.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TERMS "RENEWABLE ENERGY
 SYSTEMS" AND "SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT" SHALL HAVE THE SAME  MEANINGS
 AS IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
