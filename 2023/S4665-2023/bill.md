  (t) any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to  an  identifi-
 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a
 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of  the  penal  law,  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, or any charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  firearm  as
 defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, provided, however, that
 the prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the  defendant
 committed  the  instant crime and any underlying crime. For the purposes

 fying  offense  as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes of this
 paragraph, "harm to an identifiable person or  property"  shall  include
 but  not  be  limited  to theft of or damage to property. However, based
 upon a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if  the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in  furtherance  of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal shall be
 released on his or her own recognizance or under  appropriate  non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
