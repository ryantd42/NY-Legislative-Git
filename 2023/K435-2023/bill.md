  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 15, 2023, as Lymphoma Awareness Day in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  15,  2023,  as
Lymphoma Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of World Lymphoma Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lymphoma Awareness Day will be celebrated each year on the
15th, during the month of  September,  which  was  recognized  as  Blood
Cancer Awareness Month (BCAM) by the United States Congress in 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS, The blood cancer community uses BCAM and Lymphoma Awareness
Day to raise awareness and educate others about lymphoma and other blood
cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lymphoma  is  the most common form of blood cancer and the
third most common cancer of childhood, and  is  a  cancer  that  affects
lymphocytes,  which  are  a type of white blood cell that travel through
the blood and lymphatic  system  to  defend  the  body  against  foreign
invaders like bacteria and viruses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lymphomas  usually  develop  when  a  change, or mutation,
occurs within a lymphocyte,  causing  the  abnormal  cell  to  replicate
faster than, or live longer than, a normal lymphocyte; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than 70,000 new cases of lymphoma are diagnosed each
year in the United States, including 5,150 in New  York  State;  Cristal
Hammond is one of those people, having been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma on June 6, 2011; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  then,  Cristal  Hammond  has  bravely  battled this
disease and perseveres in her fight to win the battle over Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  many  subtypes  of  Non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma,
including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  cure for lymphoma can only be realized through advanced
cancer research; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awareness and education are powerful tools in the  race  to
find  a  cure for lymphoma; the health and vitality of the people of New
York  are  significantly  enhanced  by  local  efforts  to  increase
communication and education pertaining to blood cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lymphoma Awareness Day helps to raise general awareness of
the disease and provides hope  to  all  those  affected  by  a  lymphoma
diagnosis; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  15,  2023,  as
Lymphoma Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and to Cristal Hammond.
