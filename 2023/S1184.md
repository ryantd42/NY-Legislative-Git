 AN  ACT to amend the public service law, in relation to requiring legis-
  lative approval of increases in utility charges

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "utility
 ratepayer protection act".
  § 2.  Subdivision 12 of section 66  of  the  public  service  law  is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (b-1) to read as follows:
  (B-1)  NO CHANGE SHALL BE MADE IN ANY RATE OR CHARGE, WHICH SHALL HAVE
 BEEN FILED BY A UTILITY IN COMPLIANCE WITH AN ORDER OF  THE  COMMISSION,
 WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE BY A MAJORITY VOTE
 IN EACH HOUSE. THE UTILITY SHALL SUBMIT A WRITTEN REPORT TO THE LEGISLA-
 TURE  AT  LEAST  ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS  PRIOR  TO THE DATE WHEN ANY
 PROPOSED INCREASE IN FEES, RENTALS AND  CHARGES  FOR  THE  PROVISION  OF
 SERVICES  BY  THE UTILITY IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT. SUCH REPORT SHALL
 INCLUDE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED INCREASE, AND INFORMATION SETTING
 FORTH THE CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE  UTILITY.  THE  LEGISLATURE
 MAY  REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA OR INFORMATION THAT IT DEEMS NECESSARY.
 IF THE LEGISLATURE, OR THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES  THEREOF,  FINDS  THAT
 THE  PROPOSED  INCREASES ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT REVENUE
 TO MEET THE EXPENSE OF THE PROVISION OF SERVICES, INCLUDING THE  MAINTE-
 NANCE  AND  OPERATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THEN NO PROPOSED INCREASE SHALL
 TAKE EFFECT UNTIL APPROVED BY A MAJORITY  VOTE  OF  EACH  HOUSE  OF  THE
 LEGISLATURE.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
