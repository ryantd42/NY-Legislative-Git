 Introduced by M. of A. RAJKUMAR, COLTON -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Cities
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public authorities law, in relation to exempting
  veterans organizations in New York city from sewer and water charges
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 5 of section 1045-j of the public authorities
 law, as amended by chapter 514 of the laws of 1984, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  5.  Such  fees,  rates,  rents or other charges, if not paid when due,
 shall constitute a lien upon the premises served and  a  charge  against
 the  owners  thereof,  which  lien and charge shall bear interest at the
 same rate as would unpaid taxes  of  the  city.  Such  lien  shall  take
 precedence  over  all other liens or encumbrances, except taxes, and may
 be foreclosed against the lot or building served in the same manner as a
 lien for such taxes. The amount which remains due and unpaid  for  sixty
 days  may,  with  interest thereon at the same rate as unpaid city taxes
 and with reasonable attorneys' fees, be recovered by the water board  in
 a  civil  action in the name of the water board against such owners. The
 city, and any state agency shall be subject to  the  same  fees,  rates,
 rents  or other charges under the same conditions as other users of such
 water system or sewerage system, or both, as the case may be. Tax exempt
 organizations shall be charged according to the  provisions  of  chapter
 six  hundred ninety-six of the laws of eighteen hundred eighty-seven, as
 amended by chapters eight hundred ninety-three and eight  hundred  nine-
 ty-four  of  the laws of nineteen hundred eighty and by provisions which
 may by law extend the provisions of such chapters  from  time  to  time;
 PROVIDED THAT VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS, AS DEFINED IN SECTION FOUR HUNDRED
 FIFTY-TWO  OF  THE  REAL PROPERTY TAX LAW AND LOCATED IN THE CITY, SHALL
 NOT BE CHARGED, ANY INCONSISTENT PROVISION OF LAW  NOTWITHSTANDING.  Any
 agreement  for the supply of water or sewerage services between the city

 or an agency thereof and any other municipality or water supply  system,
 or  any  administrative  determination  by  a state agency, or any other
 arrangement in this regard, in effect at the time the water board  shall
 be  established,  shall  remain  in full force and effect and be binding
 upon the water board as if it were a party to such  agreement,  determi-
 nation  or  other arrangement.  All rights, powers, duties, obligations
 and functions provided by law with respect to the fixing of  charges  or
 rates  for the supply of water or sewerage services to users outside the
 city, including but not limited to those set forth in  [article  one  of
 title  K  of chapter fifty-one] SECTION 5-429 of the administrative code
 of the city of New York and article eight of the environmental conserva-
 tion law, shall be deemed to apply, as appropriate, to the  water  board
 established  pursuant  to  this title.  In addition to any other lawful
 enforcement methods and pursuant to rules and regulations of  the  water
 board  promulgated  pursuant  to this title, the payment of fees, rates,
 rents or other charges for water service  or  sewerage  service  to  any
 premises  may be enforced by discontinuing the water service or sewerage
 service to such premises provided that such  discontinuance  or  discon-
 nection  of any supply of water or the provision of sewerage service, or
 both, as the case may be, shall not be carried out except in the  manner
 and upon the notice as is required of a water-works corporation pursuant
 to  subdivisions  three-a,  three-b and three-c of section eighty-nine-b
 and section one hundred sixteen of the public service law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
