 PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION.  The commence-
 ment of such [ten year period] REAL  PROPERTY  TAX  EXEMPTION  shall  be
 governed  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph. Where a qualified owner owns
 qualifying  residential real property on the effective date of the local
 law or resolution providing for such exemption, such [ten  year  period]
 EXEMPTION  shall  [be  measured]  TAKE  EFFECT  from the assessment roll
 prepared pursuant to the first taxable status date occurring on or after
 the effective date of the local law or  resolution  providing  for  such
 exemption.  Where  a qualified owner does not own qualifying residential
 real property on the effective date  of  the  local  law  or  resolution
 providing for such exemption, such [ten year period] EXEMPTION shall [be
 measured]  TAKE EFFECT from the assessment roll prepared pursuant to the
 first taxable status date occurring at least sixty days after  the  date
 of  purchase of qualifying residential real property; provided, however,
 that should the veteran apply for and be granted  an  exemption  on  the
 assessment  roll  prepared  pursuant  to a taxable status date occurring
 within sixty days after the date of purchase of residential real proper-
 ty, such [ten year period] EXEMPTION shall  [be  measured]  TAKE  EFFECT
 from  the  first  assessment  roll  in  which the exemption occurs. If[,
 before the expiration of such ten year period,] such exempt property  is
 sold  and  replaced with other residential real property, such exemption
 may be granted pursuant to this subdivision for the [unexpired]  portion
 of  the [ten year exemption] REMAINING ASSESSMENT ROLL period[, provided
 however, that notwithstanding the ten year  limitation  imposed  by  the
 foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, a county, city, town, village
 or  school  district that has adopted a local law or resolution pursuant
 to paragraph (a) of this subdivision may adopt a local law or resolution
 providing that the exemption authorized by this section shall  apply  to
 qualifying owners of qualifying real property for as long as they remain
 qualifying  owners,  without  regard  to such ten year limitation]. Each
 county, city, town or village may adopt a local  law,  and  each  school
 district  may adopt a resolution, to reduce the maximum exemption allow-
 able in paragraphs (a) and (b)  of  this  subdivision  to  six  thousand
 dollars,  nine thousand dollars and thirty thousand dollars, respective-
 ly, or four thousand dollars, six thousand dollars and  twenty  thousand
 dollars,  respectively.  Each  county,  city,  town,  or village is also

 tively;  fourteen  thousand  dollars,  twenty-one  thousand  dollars and
