 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 9 of section 1000 of the retirement and social

  This bill would decrease the amount of  payment  required  by  Tier  6
 members  of  the  New  York  State  and Local Police and Fire Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS) who are obtaining military service credit pursuant  to
 Section  1000  of  the Retirement and Social Security Law. Under current
 law,  a  Tier 6 member must pay a sum equal to the product of the number
 of years of military service being  claimed  and  six  percent  of  such
 member's  compensation  earned  during  the  twelve  months  of credited
 service immediately preceding the date that the member made  application
 for  credit.  Beginning  with applications received on or after April 1,
 2024, this legislation would require such  members  to  pay  only  three
 percent of compensation per year of service being claimed.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is
 estimated that the cost for the reduction of the member's  payment  will
 be  3%  of an affected members' compensation for each year of additional
 service that is purchased. This cost would be shared by the State of New
 York and the local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
