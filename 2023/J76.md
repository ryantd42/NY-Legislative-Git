  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Skin  Cancer  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023,  as  Skin  Cancer  Awareness
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Melanoma Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Academy of Dermatology has designated National
Melanoma Month to raise awareness about skin cancer;  many  events  have
been planned focused on skin health, sun safety, tanning prevention, and
skin cancer screening and resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United
States,  with about 1.3 million new cases diagnosed each year; according
to the Skin Cancer Foundation,  the  incidence  and  mortality  of  skin
cancer  have increased exponentially during the past several decades and
every year the figure mounts; and
 
  WHEREAS, One in five Americans will develop  skin  cancer  in  their
lifetime; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the American Cancer Society, it is anticipated
that this year approximately 76,690 new cases of malignant melanoma will
be diagnosed in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is estimated by the American Cancer Society that there
will be approximately 9,480 deaths attributable  to  malignant  melanoma
and other skin cancers in 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over one million new cases will be basal cell carcinoma and
squamous  cell  carcinoma, which have a better than 98 percent cure rate
if detected early; and
 
  WHEREAS, The best way to prevent skin cancer is to  avoid  the  sun,
especially between the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., when its rays are the
strongest; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Cancer Society recommends that when people are
out in the sun, they should wear wide-brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts,
and pants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  also suggested that people use a sunscreen product
with a sun protection factor of at least 30, applying it  15-30  minutes
before  going into the sun, and re-applying it every two hours and after
swimming or sweating, and discarding any product that may be over a year
old unless there is an expiration date; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important to realize that one must be wary of  cloudy
days too, because it is still possible to get burned; and
 
  WHEREAS, The sun's rays can reach through three feet of water; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Academy  of  Dermatology  urges everyone to
examine their skin regularly, since most skin cancers can  be  cured  if
detected early; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body affirms its commitment to promote an
environment which supports and encourages vigorous research  activities,
and the institutions engaged in those activities, to further skin cancer
research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  also  reaffirms its commitment to
foster efforts directed at the advancement of detection, diagnosis,  and
treatment of skin cancer; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as  Skin  Cancer
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
