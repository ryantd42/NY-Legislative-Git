  HONORING  the Youth Change Leader Collaborative at
  Baldwin High  School  upon  receiving  an  Honorable
  Mention in the Invent2Prevent National Competition
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the intent of this Legislative Body to commend and
pay tribute to those young people who, by achieving outstanding  success
in  educational  competition,  have  inspired  and  brought pride to our
majestic Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the  Youth  Change  Leader  Collaborative  at  Baldwin  High School upon
receiving  an  Honorable  Mention  in  the  Invent2Prevent  National
Competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Youth  Change  Leader  Collaborative  at Baldwin High
School was founded in September of 2022 by  a  group  of  over  30  high
school  students  who  aspire  to  be  civic leaders; their organization
tackles and creates action plans on civic issues in their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year,  they  participated  in  "Invent2Prevent,"  a
national  competition  which  aims  to  empower  schools and students by
challenging  them  to  create  and  implement  products,  tools,  and
initiatives  to  target  issues  in  their  communities;  since
Invent2Prevent's inception in Spring 2021, more than 700  students  have
participated in teams competing at the high school and collegiate levels
for  awards  of  $5,000  for  first  place; $3,000 for second place; and
$1,000 for third place; top place collegiate-level finishers  also  have
the option to enter into a one-year sustainment program; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sophomore,  junior,  and  senior  students  from the Youth
Change Leader Collaborative  at  Baldwin  High  School,  researched  and
gathered  data  on  five global issues: gun violence prevention, climate
justice,  immigration  reform,  health  equity,  documentation  and
journalism;  they  then  created  a  civic action plan relating to these
areas of interest; and
 
  WHEREAS, The students were required to participate in frequent video
calls  with  "Invent2Prevent"  staff,  and  then  elected  to  develop
curriculum  based  on  a  project,  which  focused  on  reducing gun and
interpersonal  violence,  while  also  producing  a  30-page  curriculum
report,  a  video  about  their  project,  as well as a 10-page research
paper; and
 
  WHEREAS, Working with professionals in related areas of  study,  the
students  collaborated  with  mentors from Amazon, Northwell Health, and
the Nassau County Bar Association, learning an abundance of  information
which  poised them for their placing in the top five, beating out dozens
of participating advocacy groups, colleges and  universities,  and  high
schools; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is moved to honor the Youth Change
Leader Collaborative at Baldwin  High  School,  a  body  of  outstanding
 
scholars,  recognizing  the  value  of their labors and the promise of a
bright future because of them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the Youth Change Leader Collaborative at Baldwin High School  upon
receiving  an  Honorable  Mention  in  the  Invent2Prevent  National
Competition; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  Youth  Change Leader Collaborative at Baldwin High
School.
