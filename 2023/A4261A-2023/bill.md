 AN ACT to amend the penal law and the general business law, in  relation
  to  establishing  a  waiting period before a firearm, shotgun or rifle
  may be delivered to a person

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  12  of  section  400.00 of the penal law, as
 amended by chapter 207 of the laws  of  2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  12. Records required of gunsmiths and dealers in firearms. In addition
 to  the  requirements set forth in article thirty-nine-BB of the general
 business law, any person licensed as  gunsmith  or  dealer  in  firearms
 shall  keep a record book approved as to form, except in the city of New
 York, by the superintendent of state police. In the record book shall be
 entered at the time of every transaction involving a firearm  the  date,
 name, age, occupation and residence of any person from whom a firearm is
 received  or  to  whom  a  firearm  is delivered, and the calibre, make,
 model, manufacturer's name and serial number,  or  if  none,  any  other
 distinguishing  number  or  identification  mark on such firearm. Before
 delivering a firearm to any person, the licensee shall  require  him  to
 produce  either  a  license valid under this section to carry or possess
 the same, or proof of lawful authority as an exempt person  pursuant  to
 section  265.20  of  this  chapter  and [either (a) the National Instant
 Criminal Background Check System (NICS) or its successor  has  issued  a
 "proceed" response to the licensee, or (b) thirty calendar] TEN BUSINESS
 days  have  elapsed  since  the  date  the licensee contacted [NICS] THE
 NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM (NICS) OR ITS  SUCCES-
 SOR  to  initiate  a national instant criminal background check and NICS
 has not notified the licensee that the transfer of the firearm  to  such
 person  should  be denied. In addition, before delivering a firearm to a

 peace officer, the licensee shall verify that person's status as a peace
 officer with the division of state police. After completing the  forego-
 ing,  the licensee shall remove and retain the attached coupon and enter
 in the record book the date of such license, number, if any, and name of
 the  licensing  officer, in the case of the holder of a license to carry
 or possess, or the shield  or  other  number,  if  any,  assignment  and
 department,  unit  or  agency,  in  the  case  of  an exempt person. The
 original transaction report shall be forwarded to the division of  state
 police  within  ten  days  of  delivering a firearm to any person, and a
 duplicate copy shall be kept by  the  licensee.  The  superintendent  of
 state police may designate that such record shall be completed and tran-
 smitted in electronic form. A dealer may be granted a waiver from trans-
 mitting such records in electronic form if the superintendent determines
 that  such dealer is incapable of such transmission due to technological
 limitations that are not reasonably within the control of the dealer, or
 other exceptional circumstances demonstrated by the dealer, pursuant  to
 a process established in regulation, and at the discretion of the super-
 intendent.  Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in
 the database created pursuant to section 400.02 of  this  article  shall
 not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the public offi-
 cers  law. The record book shall be maintained on the premises mentioned
 and described in the license and shall be open at all  reasonable  hours
 for  inspection  by  any  peace  officer, acting pursuant to his special
 duties, or police officer. In the event of cancellation or revocation of
 the license for gunsmith or dealer in  firearms,  or  discontinuance  of
 business  by  a  licensee, such record book shall be immediately surren-
 dered to the licensing officer in the city of New York, and in the coun-
 ties of Nassau and Suffolk, and elsewhere in the state to the  executive
 department, division of state police.
  §  2.  Section 400.20 of the penal law, as added by chapter 129 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
 § 400.20 Waiting period in connection with the sale  or  transfer  of  a
  rifle or shotgun.
  When a national instant criminal background check is required pursuant
 to  state  or  federal  law to be conducted through the National Instant
 Criminal Background Check System (NICS) or its successor  in  connection
 with  the  sale  or transfer of a rifle or shotgun to any person, before
 delivering a rifle or shotgun to  such  person,  [either  (a)  NICS  has
 issued  a  "proceed" response to the seller or transferor, or (b) thirty
 calendar] TEN BUSINESS days shall have elapsed since the date the seller
 or transferor contacted NICS to initiate  a  national  instant  criminal
 background  check  [and  NICS  has not notified the seller or transferor
 that the transfer of the rifle or  shotgun  to  such  person  should  be
 denied].
  §  3.  Subdivision  1  of  section 897 of the general business law, as
 amended by chapter 129 of the laws  of  2019,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. A national instant criminal background check shall be conducted and
 no  person  shall  sell or transfer a firearm, rifle or shotgun at a gun
 show, except in accordance with the  provisions  of  18  U.S.C.  922(t),
 provided  that  before  delivering  a  firearm,  rifle or shotgun to any
 person, [either (a)  the  National  Instant  Criminal  Background  Check
 System  (NICS)  or  its successor has issued a "proceed" response to the
 seller or transferor, or (b) thirty calendar] TEN  BUSINESS  days  shall
 have  elapsed  since  the date the seller or transferor contacted [NICS]
 THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND  CHECK  SYSTEM  (NICS)  OR  ITS

  §  4. Subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 898 of the general business law,
 as amended by chapter 129 of the laws of 2019, are amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. In addition to any other requirements pursuant to state and federal
 law,  all  sales, exchanges or disposals of firearms, rifles or shotguns
 shall be conducted in accordance with this  section  unless  such  sale,
 exchange  or  disposal  is  conducted  by  a licensed importer, licensed
 manufacturer or licensed dealer, as those terms are defined in 18 USC  §
 922,  when such sale, exchange or disposal is conducted pursuant to that
 person's federal firearms license or such sale, exchange or disposal  is
 between  members  of  an  immediate  family.  When  a  sale, exchange or
 disposal is conducted pursuant to a person's federal  firearms  license,
 before delivering a firearm, rifle or shotgun to any person, [either (a)
 the  National  Instant  Criminal  Background  Check System (NICS) or its

 see, or (b) thirty calendar] TEN BUSINESS days shall have elapsed  since

 initiate  a national instant criminal background check [and NICS has not
 notified the federal firearms licensee that the transfer of the firearm,
 rifle or shotgun to such person should be denied]. For purposes of  this
 section, "immediate family" shall mean spouses, domestic partners, chil-
 dren and step-children.
  2.  Before  any sale, exchange or disposal pursuant to this article, a
 national instant criminal background check must be completed by a dealer
 who consents to conduct such check, and upon completion  of  such  back-
 ground  check,  shall  complete  a  document, the form of which shall be
 approved by the superintendent of  state  police,  that  identifies  and
 confirms  that such check was performed. Before a dealer who consents to
 conduct a national instant criminal background check delivers a firearm,
 rifle or shotgun to any person, [either  (a)  NICS  issued  a  "proceed"
 response  to the dealer, or (b) thirty calendar] TEN BUSINESS days shall
 have elapsed since the date the dealer  contacted  [NICS]  THE  NATIONAL
 INSTANT  CRIMINAL  BACKGROUND  CHECK  SYSTEM  (NICS) OR ITS SUCCESSOR to
 initiate a national instant criminal background check [and NICS has  not
 notified  the  dealer that the transfer of the firearm, rifle or shotgun
 to such person should be denied].

 national instant criminal background check must be completed by a dealer
 who  shall  submit a request to the division of state police pursuant to

 check.  Before  a  dealer who has submitted a request to the division of
 state police to conduct a national  instant  criminal  background  check
