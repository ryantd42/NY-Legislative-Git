  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  1 of section 1193 of the vehicle and traffic
 law is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows:
  (H) WHERE THE COURT IMPOSES A SENTENCE  FOR  A  VIOLATION  OF  SECTION
 ELEVEN  HUNDRED  NINETY-TWO OR ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO-A OF THIS ARTI-
 CLE, THE COURT SHALL REQUIRE THE DEFENDANT, AS A PART  OR  CONDITION  OF
 SUCH  SENTENCE,  TO  PAY FOR AND TO ATTEND AN ALCOHOL AND DRUG REHABILI-
 TATION PROGRAM CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SECTION ELEVEN  HUNDRED  NINETY-SIX

 program  FOR  GOOD  CAUSE,  IN WHICH EVENT THE REASONS THEREFOR SHALL BE
 STATED UPON THE  RECORD.  The  commissioner  or  deputy  may  exercise
 discretion,  FOR GOOD CAUSE, THE REASONS FOR WHICH MUST BE MADE KNOWN TO
 THE  PERSON,  to  reject  any  person  [from  participation] referred OR
 SENTENCED to such program FROM PARTICIPATING THEREIN, and nothing herein
 contained shall be construed as creating a right to be included  in  any
 course  or  program  established  under  this section.  In addition, no
 person shall be permitted to take part in such program  if,  during  the
 five years immediately preceding commission of an alcohol or drug-relat-
 ed traffic offense or a finding of a violation of section eleven hundred
 ninety-two-a  of this article, such person has participated in a program
 established pursuant to this article or been convicted of a violation of
 any subdivision of section eleven hundred  ninety-two  of  this  article
 other  than  a  violation  committed  prior  to November first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-eight, for which such person did not participate in  such
 program.  In  the  exercise  of discretion, the commissioner or a deputy
 shall have the right to expel any participant from the program who fails
 to satisfy the requirements for participation in  such  program  or  who
 fails  to  satisfactorily  participate  in  or attend any aspect of such
 program. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this chapter, satis-
 factory participation in and completion of  a  course  in  such  program
 shall result in the termination of any sentence of imprisonment that may
 have been imposed by reason of a conviction therefor; provided, however,
 that  nothing  contained in this section shall delay the commencement of
 such sentence.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of November next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
