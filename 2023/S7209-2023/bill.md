 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Banks
 
 AN ACT to amend the banking law, the real property law, the real proper-
  ty actions and proceedings law,  the  general  business  law  and  the
  general  obligations  law,  in  relation  to enacting the "Home Equity
  Fraud Act"

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Home Equity Fraud Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The  legislature  hereby  finds  that  many
 senior  citizens  and minority homeowners in New York have been targeted
 by unethical home improvement contractors, mortgage companies,  mortgage
 brokers  and finance companies who induce these homeowners into entering
 into high cost high interest rate mortgage agreements which the homeown-
 er is often unable to afford with the intent of foreclosing on the  home
 and stripping the equity.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  in order to entice people into
 entering into these agreements they are promised refinancing of  primary
 mortgages,  consolidation  of  loans and outstanding bills and are given
 cash but often are not told or do not understand that they are  securing
 the  loan with a mortgage lien on their home which will lead to foreclo-
 sure in the event of default. Often  these  loans  are  documented  with
 false and misleading documentation provided by brokers which could easi-
 ly  be determined to be false if checked by the lender. Despite prohibi-
 tions contained in federal law many of these loans are based  on  equity
 in  the  home  and  not  on the borrower's ability to pay. Since many of
 these homeowners live on a fixed income, they are  unable  to  make  the
 required  payments  and end up losing their homes. This practice appears
 to be targeted in neighborhoods with a high concentration of senior  and
 minority residents.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7209  2
 
  The  legislature  further finds that it is in the best interest of the
 citizens of this state that these unethical practices should be  prohib-
 ited by law and that unscrupulous individuals should be denied the abil-
 ity  to utilize the courts of this state to perpetrate these abuses upon
 senior  citizens and minority residents of this state and does therefore
 enact this Home Equity Fraud Act in order to prevent predatory lending.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 595-a of the banking law is  amended  by
 adding four new paragraphs (i), (j), (k) and (l) to read as follows:
  (I)  ENGAGING  IN  ANY  ACTIVITY, TRANSACTION OR COURSE OF BUSINESS IN
 CONNECTION WITH A HOME IMPROVEMENT  CONTRACT  AS  DESCRIBED  IN  SECTION
 SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW OTHER THAN WITH REGARD
 TO  PROVIDING  SERVICES DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE MAKING OF A MORTGAGE
 LOAN PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  AND  ONLY  IF  SUCH
 SERVICES  AND  THE  FEES  PAID OR TO BE PAID IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ARE
 FULLY DISCLOSED AND AGREED TO IN WRITING BY ALL PARTIES  TO  THE  TRANS-
 ACTION.
  (J) CHARGING OR PAYING, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, A FEE IN EXCESS
 OF  THE GREATER OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR THREE PERCENT OF THE MORTGAGE
 LOAN FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED BY THE MORTGAGE BROKER.

 CHARGED FOR ALL SERVICES RENDERED IN CONNECTION WITH QUALIFYING FOR  AND
 RECEIVING THE LOAN, PROVIDED THAT ANY FEES WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID
 TO  ANY  PUBLIC  OFFICER  FOR  THE FILING, RECORDING OR RELEASING IN ANY
 PUBLIC OFFICE OF A DOCUMENT SECURING THE LOAN AND THE COSTS OF ANY TITLE
 INSURANCE OR THE FEES OF AN ATTORNEY VOLUNTARILY ENGAGED BY  AND  SOLELY
 REPRESENTING  THE INTERESTS OF THE BORROWER SHALL NOT BE INCLUDED WITHIN
 THIS LIMIT.
  (L) CHARGING A FEE OR ANYTHING OF VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH  THE  REFI-
 NANCING OF A MORTGAGE LOAN UNLESS SUCH REFINANCING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
 REDUCING  THE  RATE  ON THE MORTGAGE LOAN IN AN AMOUNT WHICH EXCEEDS THE
 COST OF SUCH REFINANCE AND WHICH WILL ALLOW THE MORTGAGOR TO RECOVER THE
 COST OF REFINANCING THE LOAN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE DATE OF SUCH  REFI-
 NANCE.  THIS  PROVISION  SHALL  NOT  APPLY TO ANY ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS IN

  (2) A NOTICE GIVING THE APPLICANT THE RIGHT TO DESIGNATE A THIRD PARTY
 TO RECEIVE COPIES OF ALL WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING THE  LOAN  AND
 SETTING FORTH THE PROCEDURE FOR THE APPLICANT TO EXERCISE SUCH RIGHT.
  IN  THE EVENT THAT THE DISCLOSURE AND NOTICES REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION
 ARE NOT MADE, THE MORTGAGE LOAN MADE AS A  RESULT  OF  SUCH  APPLICATION

 LENDER'S RIGHTS UNTIL THIRTY DAYS AFTER SUCH DISCLOSURES  ARE  MADE  AND
