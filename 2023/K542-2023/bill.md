BY: M. of A. Angelino
 
  COMMENDING Honor and Remember upon the occasion of
  hosting its New York Run for the Fallen
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative Body to publicly
commend those military organizations which substantially  contribute  to
honoring  the  memories  of  the fallen servicemembers of this State and
Nation as well as care for the well-being of  those  still  with  us  by
providing  awareness,  recognition,  and  vital  services  to  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Honor and Remember upon the occasion of hosting its New York Run
for the Fallen from Thursday, June 8, 2023, to Sunday,  June  11,  2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Honor  and  Remember  is  an  organization  serving  to
perpetually  recognize  the  sacrifice  of  America's  fallen  military
servicemembers and their families; it pays tribute to all military lives
lost,  not only for those serving on active duty but also those who have
passed as a result of serving; military deaths in all wars or  conflicts
and  all branches of service from the Nation's inception are recognized;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The primary vehicle for perpetual recognition is a specific
and dedicated symbol of remembrance created by  this  organization:  the
Honor  and  Remember  Flag,  which  is intended to fly continuously as a
tangible and visible reminder to all Americans  of  the  lives  lost  in
defense of our national freedoms; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York Run for the Fallen is a special event to call
attention to and honor the men and  women  who  have  died  in  military
service to America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  event  begins  at  the Honor the Mountain Monument in
Watertown, New York, and  ends  at  the  Gerald  B.H.  Solomon  Saratoga
National Cemetery in Schuylerville; runners run dedicated miles to honor
and  remember each fallen hero who died specifically since the beginning
of the Global War on Terrorism, but ultimately,  regardless  of  war  or
conflict,  branch  of  service,  or cause of death, participants run for
every deceased veteran; and
 
  WHEREAS, Deceased servicemembers are given tribute by name  wherever
possible  along  the  Run for the Fallen, as well as to the sacrifice of
the families they left behind; and
 
  WHEREAS, Countless New Yorkers give of their time  and  energies  to
run  across  the  State,  a  distance  in  excess of 200 miles, to raise
awareness for the lives of those who  fought  and  died,  to  rejuvenate
their  memories,  keep  their  spirits  alive, and to aid in the healing
process for the New York residents whose lives have been affected by war
and loss; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, This Legislative  Body  pauses  in  its  deliberations  to
commend Honor and Remember upon the occasion of hosting its New York Run
for  the  Fallen  to honor the deceased servicemembers of this State and
Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honor and Remember organization.
