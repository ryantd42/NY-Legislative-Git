 Introduced  by  Sens.  BAILEY, COMRIE -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the general obligations law, in  relation  to  providing
  for  compensation for injury or death caused by the negligent entrust-
  ment of a firearm

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  federal  Protection  of Lawful
 Commerce in Arms Act, 109 P.L. 92, 119 Stat. 2095, bars almost all civil
 actions or proceedings against manufacturers and  sellers  of  firearms,
 but  it provides an exemption for actions brought for negligent entrust-
 ment.  Negligent entrustment under the act  means  the  supplying  of  a
 firearm  by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or
 reasonably should know, the person to whom the product  is  supplied  is
 likely  to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable
 risk of physical injury to the person or others. It is the intent of the
 legislature to extend the negligent  entrustment  liability  of  firearm
 manufacturers  and sellers to the maximum extent allowable under federal
 law.
  § 2. The general obligations law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 11-108 to read as follows:
  §  11-108.  COMPENSATION  FOR  INJURY OR DEATH CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENT
 ENTRUSTMENT OF A FIREARM. 1. ANY PERSON WHO IS INJURED IN PERSON,  PROP-
 ERTY,  MEANS OF SUPPORT, OR OTHERWISE BY THE USE OF A FIREARM SHALL HAVE
 A RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST ANY PERSON OR ENTITY WHO CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED
 TO THE INJURY THROUGH THE NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT OF  A  FIREARM.  IN  ANY
 SUCH ACTION, THE INJURED PERSON SHALL HAVE A RIGHT TO RECOVER ACTUAL AND
 PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
  2.  IN CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE PERSON INJURED, THE ACTION OR RIGHT OF
 ACTION GIVEN BY THIS ACTION SHALL SURVIVE TO  HIS  OR  HER  EXECUTOR  OR
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 1094  2
 
 ADMINISTRATOR,  AND  THE AMOUNT SO RECOVERED BY EITHER A SPOUSE OR CHILD
 SHALL BE HIS OR HER SOLE AND SEPARATE PROPERTY.
  3.  ACTIONS AS DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OR TWO OF THIS SECTION MAY
 BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
  4. IN ANY CASE WHERE PARENTS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO SUCH DAMAGES, EITHER
 PARENT MAY SUE ALONE THEREFOR, BUT RECOVERY BY ONE OF SUCH PARTIES SHALL
 BE A BAR TO SUIT BROUGHT BY THE OTHER.
  5. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT" MEANS THE  SUPPLY-
 ING  OF  A FIREARM BY A SELLER FOR USE BY ANOTHER PERSON WHEN THE SELLER
 KNOWS, OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW, THE PERSON  TO  WHOM  THE  PRODUCT  IS
 SUPPLIED  IS  LIKELY TO, AND DOES, USE THE PRODUCT IN A MANNER INVOLVING
 UNREASONABLE RISK OF PHYSICAL INJURY TO THE PERSON OR OTHERS.
  6. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE DISTRIBUTION OF AN  AUTOMATIC
 OR  SEMI-AUTOMATIC  FIREARM  NOT  TYPICALLY  USED  FOR  LAWFUL  HUNTING
 PURPOSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HANDGUNS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS,  TO
 THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THOSE WITH A PERMIT TO POSSESS A FIREARM, INVOLVES
 AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF PHYSICAL INJURY TO OTHERS.
  §  3.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 claims arising on or after such effective date and to all claims pending
 on such effective date.
