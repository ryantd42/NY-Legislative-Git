  COMMEMORATING  the  61st  Anniversary  of  the
  Independence of Jamaica
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
commemorate the 61st Anniversary of the Independence of Jamaica; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  Jamaican  independence  affirms  the
culture, identity and self-esteem of a people; it honors a rich heritage
and illuminates Jamaican history and tradition, as well as the spirit of
an indomitable people; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of this great State and Nation and Jamaica enjoy
a deep and abiding relationship rooted in kinship and culture, and  many
New Yorkers proudly trace their own roots to Jamaica; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  ancient  past, Jamaica, West Indies, was known as
"Xaymaca" which when literally translated means Land of Wood  and  Water
or the Land of Springs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every year August 6th is celebrated as Independence Day in
Jamaica; the country acquired its independence from the British colonial
powers  on  August  6,  1962,  after  years  of  political  subjugation;
initially  a  Spanish  territory,  Jamaica  was  soon  taken over by the
British in the 17th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jamaica was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1494  and
proclaimed  as  a  territory of Spain; in the 17th Century, Jamaica came
under the control of the British  following  an  expedition  by  General
Robert  Venables  and  Admiral  Sir William Penn; the Spanish were over-
thrown by a strong British force that established its control  over  the
island; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  a  span of a couple of centuries, the conflict between
the colonizers and the colonized was extreme; Jamaica was made  a  Crown
Colony  on August 1, 1834, and it managed to acquire a certain degree of
political autonomy in the 1940s; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jamaica attained its independence on August 6, 1962, and is
a member of the British Commonwealth; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 61st Anniversary of Jamaica's Independence provides  an
opportunity  to recognize the significance of their contributions to the
quality and character of life, and, through events and  activities,  for
all  people  to  gain  a  greater  appreciation  of Jamaican history and
traditions, and of the role Jamaicans have played, and will continue  to
play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 61st Anniversary of the Independence of Jamaica.
