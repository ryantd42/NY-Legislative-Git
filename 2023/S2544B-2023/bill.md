  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 7001 of the education law, as  amended  by  chapter
 438  of  the laws of 2012, subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 3 as
 added by chapter 23 of the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  § 7001. Definition of practice of podiatry. 1.  The  practice  of  the
 profession of podiatry is defined as diagnosing, treating, operating and
 prescribing for any disease, injury, deformity or other condition of AND
 AFFECTING the foot, ANKLE, SKIN AND THE SOFT TISSUE OF THE LEG BELOW THE
 TIBIAL TUBEROSITY, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, and may include performing
 physical  evaluations  in  conjunction  with  the provision of podiatric
 treatment.  [For the purposes of wound care  however,  the  practice  of
 podiatry  shall include the treatment of such wounds if they are contig-
 uous with wounds relating, originating or in the course of treatment  of
 a  wound  on the foot within the podiatric scope of practice.] THE PRAC-
 TICE OF PODIATRY SHALL NOT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING  TREATMENTS  OR  PROCE-

 FLAPS OR MICROVASCULAR ANASTAMOSES. Wound  care  shall  not[,  however,]
 extend  beyond  the  level  ending at the distal tibial tuberosity. [The
 practice of podiatry may also include  diagnosing,  treating,  operating
 and prescribing for any disease, injury, deformity or other condition of
 the  ankle and soft tissue of the leg below the tibial tuberosity if the
 podiatrist has obtained an issuance of a privilege to perform  podiatric
 standard  ankle  surgery  or  advanced  ankle surgery in accordance with

 section seven thousand nine of  this  article.]  Podiatrists  may  treat
 traumatic  open wound fractures only in hospitals, as defined in article
 twenty-eight of the public health law. For the purposes of this article,
 the  term "ankle" shall be defined as the distal [metaphysis and epiphy-
 sis of the] tibia and fibula[, the articular] AND RELATED cartilage  [of
 the  distal  tibia  and  distal  fibula,  the ligaments that connect the
 distal metaphysis and epiphysis of the tibia and fibula and talus,]  AND
 LIGAMENTS and the portions of skin, subcutaneous tissue, facia, muscles,
 tendons,  ligaments and nerves at or below the level of the myotendinous
 junction of the triceps surae.
  2. [The practice of podiatry shall not include treating  any  part  of
 the  human  body  other  than  the  foot,  nor treating fractures of the
 malleoli or cutting operations upon the malleoli unless  the  podiatrist
 obtains  an  issuance of a privilege to perform podiatric standard ankle
 surgery or podiatric  advanced  ankle  surgery.]  Podiatrists  who  have
 obtained  an  issuance  of  a  privilege to perform [podiatric standard]
 ankle surgery may perform surgery on the ankle which  may  include  soft
 tissue  and  osseous  procedures  except  those  procedures specifically
 authorized for podiatrists who have obtained an issuance of a  privilege
 for advanced ankle surgery. Podiatrists who have obtained an issuance of
 a  privilege  to  perform  podiatric  advanced ankle surgery may perform
 surgery on the ankle which may include ankle  fracture  fixation,  ankle
 fusion,  [ankle  arthroscopy,] insertion or removal of external fixation
 pins into or from the tibial diaphysis at or  below  the  level  of  the
 myotendinous junction of the triceps surae, and insertion and removal of
 retrograde tibiotalocalcanneal intramedullary rods and locking screws up
 to the level of the myotendinous junction of the triceps surae, but does
 not  include  the  surgical treatment of complications within the tibial
 diaphysis related to the use of such external fixation pins. Podiatrists
 licensed to practice, but not  authorized  to  prescribe  or  administer
 narcotics  prior  to  the  effective date of this subdivision, may do so
 only after certification by the department in accordance with the quali-
 fications established by the  commissioner.  The  practice  of  podiatry
 shall  include  administering  only  local  anesthetics  for therapeutic
 purposes as well as for anesthesia and  treatment  under  general  anes-
 thesia  administered  by authorized persons. The practice of podiatry by
 any licensee shall not include [partial or total ankle replacements nor]
 the treatment of pilon fractures.
  3. (a) The department shall conduct a study to  determine  whether  to
 make  available  to the public profiles on podiatrists who have obtained
 an issuance of a privilege to perform [podiatric standard  or  advanced]
 ankle  surgery  pursuant  to [subdivisions one and two of] section seven
 thousand nine of this article. Such study shall include consideration of
 whether it would be appropriate and feasible for the department to  make
 publicly  available profiles for such podiatrists in a manner similar to
 physician profiles made available on the department of health's  website
 in  accordance  with  section  twenty-nine  hundred ninety-five-a of the
 public health law. The department shall consult with the  department  of
 health  as  necessary on matters related to the operation of the depart-
 ment of health's physician  profiles  established  pursuant  to  section
 twenty-nine hundred ninety-five-a of the public health law in conducting
 its study.
  (b)  If  the  department  determines  that  making podiatrist profiles
 available is appropriate and feasible, the department,  after  consulta-
 tion  with  the  department  of  health,  shall outline in such study an
 appropriate and cost effective method of presenting relevant and  appro-
 S. 2544--A  3
 
 priate  podiatric  profiling  information  to  the  general  public. The
 department shall submit such study to the governor, the temporary presi-
 dent of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority leader  of
 the senate and the minority leader of the assembly on or before November
 first, two thousand sixteen.
  (c) If the department makes podiatrist profiles available as set forth
 in  paragraph  (b)  of  this subdivision, the department of health shall
 include on its website containing  the  physician  profiles  established
 pursuant  to  section  twenty-nine  hundred  ninety-five-a of the public
 health law a link to the website on which such podiatrist  profiles  may
 be accessed and a statement describing the purpose of such link.
