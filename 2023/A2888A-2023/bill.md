  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Article 8 of the  public  authorities  law  is  amended  by

  TITLE 9-C
  CLEAN ENERGY OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY PLANNING PROGRAM
 SECTION 1910. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.

  1913. FUNDING.
  1914. REPORTING.
  § 1910. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. 1. FINDINGS. THE
 LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS, DETERMINES, AND DECLARES:
  (A) NEW YORK WILL NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENER-
 GY  PROJECTS,  BOTH LARGE-SCALE AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SYSTEMS, IN ORDER
 TO ACHIEVE THE MANDATES OF THE NEW YORK  STATE  CLIMATE  LEADERSHIP  AND
 COMMUNITY  PROTECTION ACT ENACTED AS CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS
 OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN (THE "CLCPA").
  (B) IN ADDITION TO THE AUTHORITY'S PROCUREMENT PROGRAMS  AND  IMPROVED
 STATE  PERMITTING  PROCESSES,  RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS REQUIRE COLLAB-
 ORATION BETWEEN HOST COMMUNITIES  AND  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  DEVELOPERS  IN
 ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFULLY AND APPROPRIATELY SITED AND CONSTRUCTED.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (C) LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO MEETING THE GOALS OF THE
 CLCPA,  BUT  COMMUNITIES  OFTEN DO NOT HAVE CAPACITY OR SUFFICIENT TOOLS
 AND INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY PLAN FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SITING.
  (D)  COMMUNITY CONCERNS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF LARGE-SCALE
 AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT BOTH CAN PROVIDE ENER-
 GY COST SAVINGS FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES  IN  THE  COMMUNITY,  LOCAL
 INFRASTRUCTURE  IMPROVEMENT,  LOCAL  TAX  REVENUE AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS,
 LOCAL JOB CREATION, AND CLEANER AIR.
  (E) THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCAL BENEFITS  AND
 IMPACTS  OF  RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND THE BEST WAYS FOR COMMUNI-
 TIES TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS WHILE AVOIDING AND MITIGATING IMPACTS.
  (F) A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH  IS  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE  COMMUNITIES,
 INCLUDING  DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS DESIGNATED UNDER THE CLCPA, WITH
 THE INFORMATION, TOOLS AND FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE  APPROPRIATE
 SITING  AND  ACCEPTANCE  OF  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  SOURCES, INCLUDING WIND,
 SOLAR, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UPGRADES.
  2. INTENT. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ENACTING THIS  TITLE
 TO  EMPOWER THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND MECHANISMS
 TO:
  (A) EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND BUILD CONSENSUS ON THE BENEFITS OF A  SHIFT
 TO  RENEWABLE  ENERGY,  WHICH  WILL PROVIDE JOBS, LOWER ENERGY COSTS AND
 REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY, AND REDUCE  THE  NEED  FOR  FOSSIL  FUEL  BASED
 POWER,  BRINGING CLEAN AIR AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND REDUCED GREEN-
 HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT LEAD TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS;
  (B) PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL REPRE-
 SENTATIVES TO PROMOTE THE APPROPRIATE AND SUCCESSFUL SITING OF RENEWABLE
 ENERGY PROJECTS, INCLUDING WIND, SOLAR,  STORAGE  AND  TRANSMISSION  AND
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGRADES;
  (C)  EQUIP  LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS WITH THE TOOLS AND FUNDING THEY NEED TO
 EFFECTIVELY CONSIDER NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS, THE POTENTIAL FOR CO-LO-
 CATION AND  DUAL-USE  SOLUTIONS,  EFFECTIVE  UTILIZATION  OF  PREVIOUSLY
 DISTURBED  OR  DEVELOPED SITES, AND PROTECTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES
 WHEN PLANNING FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND
  (D) HELP COMMUNITIES DEVELOP AND  ADOPT  LOCAL  PLANNING,  ZONING  AND
 OTHER POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT OF
 LOCAL  CLEAN  ENERGY  THROUGH  PROCESSES  THAT ENSURE AND ENHANCE PUBLIC
 OUTREACH, EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY IN  FRONTLINE  COMMUNI-
 TIES  THAT  HAVE  HISTORICALLY  BEEN  DISENFRANCHISED  AND DISCRIMINATED
 AGAINST IN THE LOCAL LAND USE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
