  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Article 8 of the  public  authorities  law  is  amended  by

  TITLE 9-C
  CLEAN ENERGY OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY PLANNING PROGRAM
 SECTION 1910. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1911. DEFINITIONS.
  1912. POWERS AND DUTIES.
  1913. FUNDING.
  1914. REPORTING.
  § 1910. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. 1. FINDINGS. THE
 LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS, DETERMINES, AND DECLARES:
  (A) NEW YORK WILL NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENER-
 GY  PROJECTS,  BOTH LARGE-SCALE AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SYSTEMS, IN ORDER
 TO ACHIEVE THE MANDATES OF THE NEW YORK  STATE  CLIMATE  LEADERSHIP  AND
 COMMUNITY  PROTECTION ACT ENACTED AS CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS
 OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN (THE "CLCPA").
  (B) IN ADDITION TO THE AUTHORITY'S PROCUREMENT PROGRAMS  AND  IMPROVED
 STATE  PERMITTING  PROCESSES,  RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS REQUIRE COLLAB-
 ORATION BETWEEN HOST COMMUNITIES  AND  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  DEVELOPERS  IN
 ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFULLY AND APPROPRIATELY SITED AND CONSTRUCTED.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 2888--A  2
 
  (C) LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO MEETING THE GOALS OF THE
 CLCPA,  BUT  COMMUNITIES  OFTEN DO NOT HAVE CAPACITY OR SUFFICIENT TOOLS
 AND INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY PLAN FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SITING.
  (D)  COMMUNITY CONCERNS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF LARGE-SCALE
 AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT BOTH CAN PROVIDE ENER-
 GY COST SAVINGS FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES  IN  THE  COMMUNITY,  LOCAL
 INFRASTRUCTURE  IMPROVEMENT,  LOCAL  TAX  REVENUE AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS,
 LOCAL JOB CREATION, AND CLEANER AIR.
  (E) THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCAL BENEFITS  AND
 IMPACTS  OF  RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND THE BEST WAYS FOR COMMUNI-
 TIES TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS WHILE AVOIDING AND MITIGATING IMPACTS.
  (F) A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH  IS  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE  COMMUNITIES,
 INCLUDING  DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS DESIGNATED UNDER THE CLCPA, WITH
 THE INFORMATION AND TOOLS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT  THE  APPROPRIATE  SITING
 AND ACCEPTANCE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES, INCLUDING WIND, SOLAR, STOR-
 AGE AND TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UPGRADES.
  2.  INTENT. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ENACTING THIS TITLE
 TO EMPOWER THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND  MECHANISMS
 TO:
  (A)  EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND BUILD CONSENSUS ON THE BENEFITS OF A SHIFT
 TO RENEWABLE ENERGY, WHICH WILL PROVIDE JOBS,  LOWER  ENERGY  COSTS  AND
 REDUCE  PRICE  VOLATILITY,  AND  REDUCE  THE  NEED FOR FOSSIL FUEL BASED
 POWER, BRINGING CLEAN AIR AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND REDUCED  GREEN-
 HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT LEAD TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS;
  (B) PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL REPRE-
 SENTATIVES TO PROMOTE THE APPROPRIATE AND SUCCESSFUL SITING OF RENEWABLE
 ENERGY  PROJECTS,  INCLUDING  WIND,  SOLAR, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION AND
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGRADES;
  (C) EQUIP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE TOOLS THEY  NEED  TO  EFFECTIVELY
 CONSIDER  NATURAL  AND  WORKING LANDS, THE POTENTIAL FOR CO-LOCATION AND
 DUAL-USE SOLUTIONS, EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION  OF  PREVIOUSLY  DISTURBED  OR
 DEVELOPED  SITES, AND PROTECTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHEN PLANNING
 FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND
  (D) HELP COMMUNITIES DEVELOP AND  ADOPT  LOCAL  PLANNING,  ZONING  AND
 OTHER POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT OF
 LOCAL  CLEAN  ENERGY  THROUGH  PROCESSES  THAT ENSURE AND ENHANCE PUBLIC
 OUTREACH, EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY IN  FRONTLINE  COMMUNI-
 TIES  THAT  HAVE  HISTORICALLY  BEEN  DISENFRANCHISED  AND DISCRIMINATED
 AGAINST IN THE LOCAL LAND USE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
