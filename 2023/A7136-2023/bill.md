 including the provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of  the  education
 law;
  (12)  The proposer's past record of compliance with federal, state and
 local laws, rules, licensing requirements, where applicable, and  execu-
 tive  orders, including but not limited to compliance with the labor law

 for awarding of contracts for bidders or offerers that are certified  as
 minority-  or  women-owned business enterprises pursuant to article 15-A

 or  women-owned business enterprises. Where an agency identifies a quan-
 titative factor pursuant to this paragraph, the agency must specify that

 pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law as well as those certified
 as  minority- or women-owned business enterprises or pursuant to section

 factor.  Nothing  in  this paragraph shall be construed as a requirement
 that such businesses be concurrently certified as  minority-  or  women-
 owned  business enterprises under both article 15-A of the executive law
 and section 1304 of the New York city charter to qualify for such  quan-
 titative factors.
  Such  basis  shall reflect, wherever possible, objective and quantifi-
 able analysis.

 complete a contract by reimbursing actual costs for labor, equipment and

 subdivision 1 of section 222 of the labor law. A project labor agreement
 shall require participation in apprentice training programs  in  accord-
 ance with paragraph (e) of subdivision 2 of such section.
  §  3.  Any contract for a public work undertaken pursuant to a project
 labor agreement in accordance with section 222 of the labor law may be a
 design-build contract in accordance with this act.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or local law, rule or  regu-
 lation to the contrary, including but not limited to section 7210 of the
 education law, article 5-A of the general municipal law and article 8 of
 the public  housing law, and in conformity with the requirements of this
 act,  for any public work that has an estimated cost of not less than 10
 million dollars and is undertaken pursuant to a project labor  agreement
 in  accordance  with  section 222 of the labor law, an authorized entity
 charged with awarding a contract for public work may use the alternative
 delivery method referred to as design-build contracts; provided that any
 authorized entity may use the alternative delivery method referred to as
 design-build contracts for any public work that has an estimated cost of
 not less than one million two hundred thousand dollars  if  such  public
 work  is  otherwise  in conformity with the requirements of this act and

 primarily consists of: pedestrian ramps and  similar  infrastructure  to
 improve access to sidewalks for people with disabilities; renovation and
 construction  of  cultural  institutions  located on publicly owned real
 property  and of public libraries; or security infrastructure, including
 bollards, planters and other physical structures,  designed  to  protect
 life and property from acts of terror or mass violence.
  (a) A contractor selected by such an authorized entity to enter into a
 design-build  contract  shall  be selected through a two-step method, as
 follows:
  (1) Step one. Generation of a list of responding  entities  that  have
 demonstrated  the  general  capability  to  perform  the  design-build
 contract. Such list shall consist of a specified  number  of  responding
 entities,  as determined by an authorized entity, and shall be generated
 based upon the authorized entity's review of  responses  to  a  publicly
 advertised  request  for qualifications. The authorized entity's request
 for qualifications shall include a general  description  of  the  public
 work,  the  maximum  number of responding entities to be included on the
 list, the selection criteria to be used and the relative weight of  each
 criteria  in generating the list.  Such selection criteria shall include
 the qualifications and experience of the design and  construction  team,
 organization,  demonstrated  responsibility, ability of the team or of a
 member or members of the team to comply  with  applicable  requirements,
 including  the  provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of the education
 law, past record of compliance with the labor law, and such other quali-
 fications the authorized entity deems appropriate, which may include but
 are not limited  to  project  understanding,  financial  capability  and
 record  of  past  performance.  The authorized entity shall evaluate and
 rate all responding entities to the request for qualifications.  Based
 upon such ratings, the authorized entity shall list the responding enti-
 ties that shall receive a request for proposals in accordance with para-
 graph  two of this subdivision. To the extent consistent with applicable
 federal law, the authorized entity shall  consider,  when  awarding  any
 contract  pursuant  to this section, the participation of (i) responding
 entities that are certified as minority- or women-owned business  enter-
 prises pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law or certified pursu-
 ant  to  local law as minority- or women-owned business enterprises; and
 (ii) small business concerns identified pursuant to subdivision  (b)  of
 section  139-g  of  the  state finance law. In addition, nothing in this
 section shall be deemed to supersede any pre-qualification guidelines or
 requirements otherwise authorized by law for an authorized entity.
  (2) Step two. Selection of the proposal which is the best value to the
 authorized entity.  The authorized entity shall  issue  a  request  for
 proposals to the responding entities listed pursuant to paragraph one of
 this  subdivision.  If  such  a  responding entity consists of a team of
 separate entities, the entities that comprise such a  team  must  remain
 unchanged from the responding entity as listed pursuant to paragraph one
 of  this subdivision unless otherwise approved by the authorized entity.
 The request for proposals shall set forth the  public  work's  scope  of
 work,  and  other  requirements, as determined by the authorized entity,
 which may include separate goals for  work  under  the  contract  to  be
 performed  by  businesses certified as minority- or women-owned business
 enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the  executive  law  or  section
 1743  of  the public authorities law, or certified pursuant to local law
 as minority-  or  women-owned  business  enterprises.  The  request  for
 proposals  shall  also  specify  the criteria to be used to evaluate the
 responses and the relative weight of each of such criteria. Such  crite-
 A. 7136  4

 ria  shall  include  the  proposal's cost, the quality of the proposal's
 solution, the qualifications and experience of the proposer,  and  other
 factors  deemed  pertinent  by the authorized entity, which may include,
 but  shall  not  be  limited  to,  the proposal's manner and schedule of
 project implementation, the proposer's ability to complete the work in a
 timely and satisfactory  manner,  maintenance  costs  of  the  completed
 public  work, maintenance of traffic approach, and community impact. Any
 contract awarded pursuant to this act shall be awarded to  a  responsive
 and  responsible  proposer,  which,  in consideration of these and other
 specified criteria deemed pertinent, offers the best  value,  as  deter-
 mined  by the authorized entity. The request for proposals shall include
 a statement that proposers shall designate in writing those portions  of
 the proposal that contain trade secrets or other proprietary information
 that  are to remain confidential; that the material designated as confi-
 dential shall be readily separable from the proposal.  Nothing  in  this
 subdivision  shall  be  construed to prohibit the authorized entity from
 negotiating final contract terms  and  conditions  including  cost.  All
 proposals  submitted shall be scored according to the criteria listed in
 the request for proposals and such final scores shall  be  published  on
 the  authorized  entity's website after registration of such contract or
 the date upon which such contract may be  implemented,  if  registration
 requirements do not apply.
  (b)  An  authorized  entity  awarding  a  design-build  contract  to a
 contractor offering the best value may but shall not be required to  use
 the following types of contracts:
  (1)  A  cost-plus  not  to  exceed  guaranteed  maximum  price form of
 contract in which the authorized entity shall be entitled to monitor and
 audit all costs. In establishing the schedule and process for  determin-
 ing  a  guaranteed  maximum  price,  the contract between the authorized
 entity and the contractor shall:
  (i) Describe the scope of the work and the  cost  of  performing  such
 work,
  (ii) Include a detailed line item cost breakdown,
  (iii)  Include a list of all drawings, specifications and other infor-
 mation on which the guaranteed maximum price is based,
  (iv) Include the dates of substantial and final  completion  on  which
 the guaranteed maximum price is based, and
  (v) Include a schedule of unit prices; or
  (2) A lump sum contract in which the contractor agrees to accept a set
 dollar  amount  for  a  contract  which  comprises  a single bid without
 providing a cost breakdown for all costs such as for  equipment,  labor,
 materials,  as well as such contractor's profit for completing all items
 of work comprising the public work.
  § 5. Any contract entered into pursuant to this act  shall  include  a
 clause  requiring  that  any professional services regulated by articles
 145, 147 and 148 of the education law shall be performed and stamped and
 sealed, where appropriate, by a professional licensed in accordance with
 the appropriate article.
  § 6. Construction with respect to each contract  entered  into  by  an
 authorized  entity  pursuant to this act shall be deemed a "public work"
 to be performed in accordance with the provisions of article  8  of  the
 labor  law, as well as subject to sections 200, 240, 241 and 242 of such
 law and enforcement of prevailing wage requirements pursuant to applica-
 ble law or, for projects or public works receiving federal aid, applica-
 ble federal requirements for prevailing wage. Any contract entered  into
 pursuant  to  this  act  shall  include  a clause requiring the selected
 A. 7136  5
 
 design builder to obligate every  tier  of  contractor  working  on  the
 public  work  to  comply  with the project labor agreement referenced in
 section three of this act, and shall  include  project  labor  agreement
 compliance  monitoring  and  enforcement  provisions consistent with the
 applicable project labor agreement.
  § 7. Each contract entered into by an authorized  entity  pursuant  to
 this  act  shall  comply  with  the objectives and goals relating to the
 performance of design and construction services by minority- and  women-
 owned  business  enterprises, or, for projects or public works receiving
 federal aid, applicable federal requirements for disadvantaged  business
 enterprises or minority- and women-owned business enterprises.
  §  8. Public works undertaken by an authorized entity pursuant to this
 act shall be subject to the requirements of article 8  of  the  environ-
 mental  conservation law, and, where applicable, the requirements of the
 National Environmental Policy Act.
  § 9. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law  to  the  contrary,  all
 rights  or  benefits,  including terms and conditions of employment, and
 protection of civil service and  collective  bargaining  status  of  all
 employees  of  authorized entities solely in connection with public work
 undertaken by an authorized  entity  pursuant  to  this  act,  shall  be
 preserved and protected.
  (b)  Nothing  in this act shall result in the: (1) displacement of any
 currently  employed  worker  or  loss  of  position  (including  partial
 displacement  such  as  a  reduction  in the hours of non-overtime work,
 wages or employment benefits), or result in the impairment  of  existing
 collective  bargaining  agreements;  and (2) transfer of existing duties
 and functions related to maintenance and operations currently  performed
 by existing employees of authorized entities to a contractor.
  (c)  Employees  of  authorized  entities  using design-build contracts
 serving in positions in newly created titles shall be  assigned  to  the
 appropriate  bargaining  unit.  Nothing  contained  in this act shall be
 construed to affect (1) the existing rights of employees of  such  enti-
 ties  pursuant  to  an existing collective bargaining agreement, (2) the
 existing representational  relationships  among  employee  organizations
 representing employees of such entities, or (3) the bargaining relation-
 ships between such entities and such employee organizations.
  (d)  Without  limiting  contractors'  obligations  under  design-build
 contracts to issue  their  own  initial  certifications  of  substantial
 completion and final completion, public employees of authorized entities
 shall  review and determine whether the work performed by contractors is
 acceptable and has been performed  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
 design-build  contracts, and if such public employees so determine, such
 public  employees  shall  accept  contractors'  substantial  or  final
 completion  of the public works as applicable. Performance by authorized
 entities of any review  described  in  this  subdivision  shall  not  be
 construed  to  modify  or  limit contractors' obligations to perform the
 work in strict accordance with the applicable design-build contracts  or
 the contractors' or any subcontractors' obligations or liabilities under
 any law.
  §  10. The submission of a proposal or responses or the execution of a
 design-build contract pursuant to this act shall not be construed to  be
 a violation of section 6512 of the education law.
  §  11.  Nothing  contained  in this act shall limit the right or obli-
 gation of any authorized entity to comply with  the  provisions  of  any
 existing contract or to award contracts as otherwise provided by law.

 with requests for qualifications issued prior to such  repeal  shall  be
 permitted to continue under this act notwithstanding such repeal.
