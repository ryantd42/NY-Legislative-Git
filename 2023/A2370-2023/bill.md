 matters connected with such department, and [to] prosecute the person or
 persons believed to have committed the same and  any  crime  or  offense
 arising  out of such investigation or prosecution or both, including but
 not limited to appearing before and presenting all  such  matters  to  a
 grand jury.
  §  3.  Subdivision 8 of section 63 of the executive law, as amended by
 chapter 451 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  8. Whenever in his OR HER judgment the public  interest  requires  it,
 the  attorney-general  may,  with the approval of the governor, and when
 directed by the governor OR THE COMMISSION ON  PUBLIC  OFFICER  INVESTI-
 GATION  CREATED PURSUANT TO SECTION 63-E OF THIS ARTICLE, shall, inquire
 into matters concerning the  public  peace,  public  safety  and  public
 justice.  For  such purpose he OR SHE may, in his OR HER discretion, and
 without civil service examination, appoint and employ, and  at  pleasure
 remove,  such  deputies,  officers  and other persons as he OR SHE deems
 necessary, determine their duties and, with the approval of  the  gover-
 nor,  fix  their  compensation.  All  appointments made pursuant to this
 subdivision shall be immediately reported to the governor, and shall not
 be reported to any other state officer or department. Payments of  sala-
 ries  and  compensation of officers and employees and of the expenses of
 the inquiry shall be made out of funds provided by the  legislature  for
 such  purposes,  which  shall be deposited in a bank or trust company in
 the names of the governor and the attorney-general, payable only on  the
 draft  or  check of the attorney-general, countersigned by the governor,
 and such disbursements shall be subject to no audit except by the gover-
 nor and the attorney-general. The attorney-general, his OR  HER  deputy,
 or  other  officer,  designated  by him OR HER, is empowered to subpoena
 witnesses, compel their  attendance,  examine  them  under  oath  before
 himself,  HERSELF  or  a magistrate and require that any books, records,
 documents or papers relevant or material to the inquiry be  turned  over
 to  him  OR  HER  for  inspection, examination or audit, pursuant to the
 civil practice law and rules. If a person subpoenaed to attend upon such
 inquiry fails to obey the  command  of  a  subpoena  without  reasonable
 cause,  or  if  a  person in attendance upon such inquiry shall, without
 reasonable cause, refuse to be sworn or to be examined or  to  answer  a
 question  or  to  produce  a book or paper, when ordered so to do by the
 officer conducting such inquiry, he OR SHE shall be guilty of  a  misde-
 meanor.  It  shall  be  the duty of all public officers, their deputies,
 assistants  and  subordinates,  clerks  and  employees,  and  all  other
 persons, to render and furnish to the attorney-general, his OR HER depu-
 ty  or  other  designated  officer,  when requested, all information and
 assistance in their possession and within their power.  Each  deputy  or
 other officer appointed or designated to conduct such inquiry shall make
 a  weekly  report  in  detail  to  the  attorney-general,  in form to be
 approved by the governor and the attorney-general, which report shall be
 in duplicate, one copy of which shall be forthwith, upon its receipt  by
 the  attorney-general,  transmitted  by  him OR HER to the governor. Any
 officer participating in such inquiry  and  any  person  examined  as  a
 witness  upon  such  inquiry who shall disclose to any person other than
 the governor or the attorney-general the name of any witness examined or
 any information obtained upon such inquiry, except as  directed  by  the
 governor or the attorney-general, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
