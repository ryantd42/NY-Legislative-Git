 amend a schedule of such fees which shall be in  amounts  determined  by
 the  division  to  be  reasonably related to the cost of conducting such
 searches and returning reports thereon but, in no event, shall any  such
 fee  exceed  twenty-five  dollars  and  an additional surcharge of fifty
 dollars. The comptroller is hereby authorized to deposit such fees  into
 the  general  fund,  provided,  however, that the monies received by the
 division of criminal justice services  for  payment  of  the  additional
 surcharge shall be deposited in equal amounts to the general fund and to
 the  fingerprint  identification and technology account. Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, the division shall not request  or  accept  any  fee  for
 searching  its  records and supplying a criminal history report pursuant
 to section two hundred fifty-one-b of the general business law  relating

 flight school or institution of higher learning.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
 completed on or before such effective date.
