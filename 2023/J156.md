  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Better Hearing Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Better
Hearing Month in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Better Hearing Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  May,  the  American  Academy of Audiology Foundation
wants every  citizen  to  celebrate  the  sounds  of  life;  this  vital
foundation  is  also  dedicated to advancing the profession of audiology
through increased public awareness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Audiology is a highly recognized profession  and  has  been
ranked by U.S. News and World Report as one of the Best Careers in 2006,
2007, 2008, and 2009; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Audiologists are the primary health-care professionals who
evaluate, diagnose, treat, and manage hearing loss and balance disorders
in adults and children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Audiologists treat all ages and types of hearing loss,  the
elderly,  adults,  teens,  children,  and  infants;  these  specialists
evaluate and diagnose hearing loss and vestibular  (balance)  disorders;
prescribe,  fit,  and  dispense hearing aids and other amplification and
hearing assistance technologies; are members of cochlear implant  teams;
perform  ear-  or  hearing-related  surgical  monitoring;  design  and
implement hearing conservation programs; design  and  implement  newborn
hearing screening programs; provide hearing rehabilitation training such
as  auditory training and listening skills improvement; assess and treat
individuals,  especially  children,  with  central  auditory  processing
disorders;  and assess and treat individuals with tinnitus (noise in the
ear, such as ringing); and
 
  WHEREAS, Almost all types  of  hearing  loss  are  treatable  by  an
audiologist;  most  hearing  loss  that is caused by nerve damage can be
treated with hearing aids,  assistive  listening  devices,  and  hearing
rehabilitation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this issue and more must be done to improve hearing health for  all  New
Yorkers  and  those  affected  by  such  hearing  health  issues;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Better
Hearing Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
