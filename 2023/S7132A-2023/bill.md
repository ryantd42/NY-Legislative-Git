 AN ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to promoting the health,
  safety,  and human rights of incarcerated pregnant individuals, incar-
  cerated birthing parents of children and their children
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative purpose and findings.  People incarcerated in
 institutions or local correctional facilities face unique  health  risks
 during  pregnancy,  childbirth, postpartum, and early childcare. Lack of
 appropriate prenatal, obstetric, and postpartum medical care, and appro-
 priate health and safety measures, can result in serious harm  to  these
 incarcerated  people  and their children. Pregnant and postpartum people
 who are incarcerated and such person's  young  children  need  prenatal,
 obstetric,  and  pediatric  care, as well as developmentally-appropriate
 resources provided in a safe, healthy, and nurturing environment. Unless
 comprehensive and compassionate laws, policies,  and  practices  are  in
 place,  the  rights  and  care of pregnant and postpartum people who are
 incarcerated and such person's young children may be compromised by  the
 conditions of confinement in correctional institutions or facilities.
  §  2.  The  section  heading  of section 611 of the correction law, as
 amended by chapter 322 of the laws  of  2021,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  §  3.  Subdivisions  2,  3 and 4 of section 611 of the correction law,
 subdivision 2 as separately amended by chapters 322 and 621 of the  laws
 of  2021,  subdivision  3 as amended by chapter 242 of the laws of 1930,
