 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Silver  Lake  Foundation  Inc.  to
  receive retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Richmond is hereby  authorized  to  accept
 from  the  Silver Lake Foundation Inc. an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax
 law  for  the  2022-2023 assessment roll for all of the 2022-2023 school
 taxes and all of the 2023 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to  such
 organization  located  at  203  Port  Richmond Avenue, in the Borough of
 Staten Island, County of Richmond, City and State of New York, otherwise
 known as tax map section 5, block 1024, lot 3. If accepted, the applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status date established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the New York City Council, may make appropriate correction
 to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such  organiza-
 tion,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the subject
 rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department may, in its  sole
 discretion,  provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
