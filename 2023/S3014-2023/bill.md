  O. POWER AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
 Any  application  made  concerning  a  project  shall include the terms,
 conditions and dates of the repayment of state appropriations authorized
 by law pursuant to a repayment agreement. Any subsidiary of,  or  corpo-
 ration  with  the  same members or directors as, a public benefit corpo-
 ration subject to the provisions of this section shall also  be  subject
 to  the  provisions of this section. All applications and submissions to
 the board required to be made by a subsidiary shall be made on behalf of
 such subsidiary by the public  benefit  corporation  which  created  the
 subsidiary.  No  public benefit corporation subject to the provisions of
 this section shall make any commitment,  enter  into  any  agreement  or
 incur  any  indebtedness  for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or
 financing any project unless prior approval has been received  from  the
 board by such public benefit corporation as provided herein.
  3.  The  board  may  approve  applications only upon its determination
 that, with relation to any proposed project, there  are  commitments  of
 funds  sufficient  to  finance  the acquisition and construction of such
 project.  In determining the sufficiency of commitments  of  funds,  the
 board  may  consider  commitments of funds, projections of fees or other
 revenues and security, which  may,  in  the  discretion  of  the  board,
 include collateral security sufficient to retire a proposed indebtedness
 or  protect  or  indemnify  against potential liabilities proposed to be
 undertaken. IN REVIEWING AN  APPLICATION  FROM  THE  LONG  ISLAND  POWER
 AUTHORITY,  THE  NORTH COUNTRY POWER AUTHORITY OR THE POWER AUTHORITY OF
 THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR THE APPROVAL OF ANY PROJECT RELATED TO  ENERGY
 GENERATION  OR  TRANSMISSION, IN ADDITION TO DETERMINING THE SUFFICIENCY
 OF COMMITMENTS OF FUNDS AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED REVIEWS,  THE  BOARD  MAY
 CONSIDER  THE  CONSISTENCY  OF THE PROJECT WITH THE CURRENT STATE ENERGY
 PLAN AND OTHER STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY-RELATED POLICIES.  A  copy
 of  such determination shall be submitted to the chief executive officer
 of the appropriate public benefit corporation and the state comptroller.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 1005-e to read as follows:
  §  1005-E.  APPROVAL  OF  CERTAIN  ACTIONS  BY  THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

 ANY  AGREEMENT NOR INCUR ANY INDEBTEDNESS UNLESS PRIOR APPROVAL HAS BEEN
 RECEIVED FROM THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES CONTROL BOARD PURSU-
 ANT TO ARTICLE ONE-A OF THIS CHAPTER.
