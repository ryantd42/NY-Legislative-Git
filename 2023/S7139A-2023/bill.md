 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  authorizing the transfer of memberships for certain members of the New
  York state and local police and fire retirement system to the New York
  state and local employees' retirement system
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 384-d of the retirement and social security law is
 amended by adding a new subdivision z to read as follows:
  Z. ANY MEMBER CURRENTLY ENROLLED PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  AND  WHO
 PREVIOUSLY HAD A MEMBERSHIP WITH THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES'
 RETIREMENT SYSTEM MAY ELECT TO RETROACTIVELY TRANSFER HIS OR HER MEMBER-
 SHIP  IN  THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 TO THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow any active member of  the  New  York  State  and
 Local  Police  and  Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS)  covered by the
 provisions of section 384-d of the Retirement and  Social  Security  Law
 (RSSL)  and  who was previously a member of the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS)  to  retroactively  transfer  all
 NYSLPFRS  service credit to the NYSLERS. Such transfer would not require
 employment in any position that would grant membership in  the  NYSLERS.
 Resulting  plan  coverage,  as  well  as  the  cost  of mandatory member
 contributions, would be based upon date of membership and last  reported
 employment instance in the NYSLERS.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7139--A  2
 
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Retirement
 System, the cost will depend upon the applicant's age, service,  salary,
 plan, and any benefit type otherwise payable.
  Insofar  as  this  bill affects the NYSLERS, pursuant to Section 25 of
 the RSSL, any costs would be borne entirely by the State of New York and
 would require an itemized appropriation sufficient to pay  the  cost  of
 the provision.
  In  addition to the per-person costs discussed above, implementing the
 provisions of this legislation would generate administrative costs.
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation cannot be readily determined, but all 25,968 active NYSLPFRS
 members  covered by the provisions of section 384-d of the RSSL would be
 eligible.
