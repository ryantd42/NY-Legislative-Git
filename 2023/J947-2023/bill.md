  of this devastating tragedy
 
  WHEREAS, The very principles of American freedom, and the safety and
security of every American at home and abroad  were  challenged  by  the

sunny afternoon on Saturday, May 14,  2022,  at  a  Tops  grocery  store

5K and Marathon, sponsored by the Lt. Aaron Salter Memorial  Scholarship
Foundation,  will  begin at 8 a.m. at Canisius College, where Salter had

Remembrance at the Tops supermarket, and church bells will chime at 2:28
p.m., the moment the 123-second rampage began; and

10  innocent people who were killed: Roberta A. Drury, Geraldine Talley,

  WHEREAS,  The  May  14th  Memorial  Commission  was  established  by
Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Byron Brown  to  combat  racism  in  all

the past; the Commission, led by Buffalo NAACP President  Reverend  Mark
Blue,  will have a leading role in uplifting the East Buffalo community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, For all New Yorkers, the images of this  horrific  domestic
act of terrorism rekindles heartbreaking memories and causes us to pause
and reflect on our daily lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The very heart and soul of America was once more shaken to
its core and this tragedy stands as a reminder that such senseless  acts
of  violence  will  not destroy the honorable values that America stands
for; and
 
  WHEREAS, The power of human compassion and the strength  and  spirit
of  the  American  people  were revealed in Buffalo as we learned of the
immediate and heroic outpouring of service and concern for  the  victims
of this act of terrorism and in its aftermath; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted  first  responders,  including  police  officers,  Erie

firefighters, who inspire us all by carrying out their sworn duties with
great courage and bravery; and

fellowship in the face of adversity  which  characterizes  the  best  of
America; and

their solidarity with Buffalo, New  York,  honoring  all  of  whom  were
victimized  by the city's worst mass shooting on Saturday, May 14, 2022,
and standing resolute in our  obligation  to  condemn  racism,  domestic
terrorism and all forms of hatred; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the one-year  Anniversary  of  the  mass  shooting  at  Tops
Friendly  Supermarkets,  and  to  extend  to  the  people of Buffalo the
sincerest best wishes and heartfelt prayers of all New Yorkers;  and  be
it further
