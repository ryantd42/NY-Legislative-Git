 SHALL  OFFER FOR SALE AT RETAIL A SPICE WHICH EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM LIMITS

  3.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  BE  AUTHORIZED  TO UTILIZE ITS ENFORCEMENT
 AUTHORITY TO RECALL SPICES THAT EXCEED THE LEVELS SET FORTH IN  SUBDIVI-
 SION TWO OF THIS SECTION.
  § 389-W. ENFORCEMENT.  WHENEVER THERE SHALL BE A VIOLATION OF SUBDIVI-
 SION TWO OF SECTION THREE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY-NINE-V  OF  THIS  ARTICLE  AN
 APPLICATION  MAY  BE  MADE  BY  THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE NAME OF THE
 PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO A COURT OR JUSTICE  HAVING  JURISDIC-
 TION  BY A SPECIAL PROCEEDING TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION, AND UPON NOTICE TO
 THE DEFENDANT OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE DAYS, TO  ENJOIN  AND  RESTRAIN  THE
 CONTINUANCE  OF  SUCH VIOLATION; AND IF IT SHALL APPEAR TO THE SATISFAC-
 TION OF THE COURT OR JUSTICE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS, IN  FACT,  VIOLATED
 SUBDIVISION  TWO OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE-V OF THIS ARTICLE,
 AN INJUNCTION MAY BE ISSUED BY  THE  COURT  OR  JUSTICE,  ENJOINING  AND
 RESTRAINING  ANY  FURTHER  VIOLATIONS,  WITHOUT REQUIRING PROOF THAT ANY
 PERSON HAS, IN FACT, BEEN  INJURED  OR  DAMAGED  THEREBY.  IN  ANY  SUCH

 HUNDRED  THREE  OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, AND DIRECT RESTITU-

 GOVERNMENT  WHETHER  BY  STATUTE OR REGULATION HAS ESTABLISHED A MAXIMUM

 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  ARTICLE AND SHALL APPLY ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF SUCH CHANGE. PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  UNLESS  AND  UNTIL  SUCH
 ADOPTION,  THE  MAXIMUM  LIMIT ESTABLISHED IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL GOVERN,
 AND ANY PROVISION OF ANY LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR ANY RULE OR  REGULATION
 PROMULGATED  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS
 SECTION BE PREEMPTED. NOTHING IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO
 RESTRICT  A  MUNICIPALITY FROM ENFORCING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION AS IT RELATES  TO  INSPECTION  OR  MONITORING  OF  FOOD  SAFETY  AS
 REQUIRED BY THE COMMISSIONER OR THE DEPARTMENT.
  2.  IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE OR THE APPLICATION THEREOF TO ANY
 PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCE IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL, SUCH  INVALIDITY  SHALL
 NOT AFFECT OTHER PROVISIONS OR APPLICATIONS OF THIS SECTION WHICH CAN BE
 GIVEN  EFFECT  WITHOUT THE INVALID PROVISION OR APPLICATION, AND TO THIS
 END THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ARE SEVERABLE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become  a
 law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any
 rule  or  regulation necessary for the implementation of this act on its
