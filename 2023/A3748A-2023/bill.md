 at the time of questioning appears to be a potential subject  of  disci-
 plinary action, HE OR SHE shall have a right to representation by his or
 her certified or recognized employee organization under article fourteen
 of  this  chapter  and shall be notified in advance, in writing, of such
 right. [A state employee who is designated  managerial  or  confidential
 under  article fourteen of this chapter, shall, at the time of question-
 ing, where it appears that such  employee  is  a  potential  subject  of
 disciplinary  action,  have a right to representation and shall be noti-
 fied in advance, in  writing,  of  such  right.]  If  representation  is
 requested  a  reasonable period of time shall be afforded to obtain such
 representation. If the employee is unable to obtain representation with-
 in a reasonable period of time the employer has the right to then  ques-
 tion  the  employee. A hearing officer under this section shall have the
 power to find that a reasonable period of time was or was not  afforded.
 In  the event the hearing officer finds that a reasonable period of time
 was not afforded then any and all statements obtained  from  said  ques-
 tioning  as  well as any evidence or information obtained as a result of
 said questioning shall be excluded, provided, however, that this  subdi-
 vision  shall  not  modify  or  replace any written collective agreement

 to  article  fourteen  of this chapter. A person against whom removal or
 other disciplinary action is proposed shall have written notice  thereof
 and  of  the  reasons therefor, shall be furnished a copy of the charges
 preferred against him OR HER and shall be allowed at  least  eight  days

 be held by the officer or body having the power  to  remove  the  person
 against  whom such charges are preferred, or by a deputy or other person
 designated by such officer or body in writing for that purpose. In  case
 a  deputy  or  other  person  is so designated, he OR SHE shall, for the
 purpose of such hearing, be vested with all the powers of  such  officer
 or body and shall make a record of such hearing which shall, with his OR
 HER  recommendations, be referred to such officer or body for review and
 decision. The person or persons holding such  hearing  shall,  upon  the
 request  of the person against whom charges are preferred, permit him OR
 HER to be represented by counsel, or by a representative of a recognized
 or certified employee organization, and shall allow him OR HER to summon
 witnesses in his OR HER behalf. The burden of  proving  incompetency  or
 misconduct  shall be upon the person alleging the same.  Compliance with
 technical rules of evidence shall not be required.
