 168 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  The commissioner may authorize an employer [which  has  in  the  three
 years  preceding  the application employed an average of one thousand or
 more persons in this state or has for one year preceding the application
 employed an average of one thousand or more persons in  this  state  and
 has  for  three  years  preceding the application employed an average of
 three thousand or more persons outside the state] to pay less frequently
 than weekly but not less frequently than semi-monthly  if  the  employer
 furnishes satisfactory proof to the commissioner of its continuing abil-
 ity  to  meet its payroll responsibilities. In making this determination
 the commissioner shall consider the following: (A) the employer's histo-
 ry meeting its payroll responsibilities in New York state or if no  such

 payroll responsibilities; (B) proof of the employer's coverage for work-
 ers' compensation and disability; (C) proof that there are no  outstand-
 ing warrants of the department of taxation and finance or the department
 of labor against the employer for failure to remit state personal income
 tax  withholdings or unemployment insurance contributions; and (D) proof
 that the employer has a computerized record keeping system  for  payroll
 which,  at  a minimum, specifies hours worked, rate of pay, gross wages,
 deductions and date of pay for each employee.  If the employers'  manual

 visions 4 and 5 to read as follows:
  4. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW  OR  REGULATION  TO  THE

 LIABILITY ON THE PART OF AND NO CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST AN  EMPLOYER  BY
 AN EMPLOYEE WHO UNKNOWINGLY VIOLATES THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
