 year period ending on the March thirty-first prior to the cost-of-living

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide an increase in the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living  adjustment  (COLA)  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System and the New York State Teachers'  Retirement  System.  Starting
 with  a payment in September 2024, the annual COLA will be computed on a
 base benefit amount  not  to  exceed  $21,000.  Additionally,  the  COLA
 payments  made from 2002 to 2022 will be recomputed based on one hundred
 percent of the annual inflation. Currently, the calculation uses a  base
 benefit  not  to  exceed  $18,000  and  annual  increases based on fifty
 percent of the annual inflation.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be borne entirely
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLERS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative  session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $14.2 billion.
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $14.1 billion  $8.4 billion
  Tier 6  $0.1 billion  $5.8 billion
  Total  $14.2 billion  $14.2 billion
 
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by  increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  the NYSLERS is 5.2% of billable salary, or
 approximately $639 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $928  million  to  the  local participating employers in the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary  in  subse-
 quent  billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of the
 affected members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $1.1 billion.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $1.1 billion  $0.6 billion
  Tier 6  $0.02 billion  $0.5 billion
  Total  $1.1 billion  $1.1 billion
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 S. 6307  4
 
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS is 2.6% of billable  salary,  or
 approximately $22 million to the State of New York and approximately $88
 million  to  the local participating employers in the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the  affected
 members.
  Further,  we  anticipate significant administrative costs to implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
