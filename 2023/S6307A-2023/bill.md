  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide an increase in the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living  adjustment  (COLA)  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System.  Starting with payments in September 2025, the annual COLA  will
 be  computed  on a base benefit amount not to exceed $21,000. Currently,
 the base benefit amount does not exceed $18,000. Additionally, the  COLA
 increment  from  2002  to  2023  will be recomputed based on one hundred
 percent of annual inflation without retroactive  payments.  Future  COLA
 increments will be based on fifty percent of annual inflation.
  This proposal primarily benefits current and former members of Tiers 1
 -  5.  The  cost  of this benefit improvement will primarily be borne by
 current and future members of Tier 6.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the  NYSLERS.
 If  this  bill  were  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 increase in the present value of benefits would be  approximately  $5.43
 billion.
 
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $5.29 billion  $2.92 billion
  Tier 6  $0.14 billion  $2.51 billion
  Total  $5.43 billion  $5.43 billion

 In  the  NYSLERS,  this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 S. 6307--A  4
 
 participating employers in  NYSLERS  is  1.9%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $240  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $360 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS.  If  this  bill  were  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative
 Session, the increase in the present value of benefits would be approxi-
 mately $626 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $604 million  $299 million
  Tier 6  $22 million  $327 million
  Total  $626 million  $626 million
 
 In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded  by  increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLPFRS  is  1.3%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $11 million to the State of New York and approximately $46
 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing  rate
 and salary of the affected members.
  Further,  we  anticipate significant administrative costs to implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
