  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Tennis Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The great State of New York recognizes and appreciates  the
importance  of  sports  such  as  tennis  as  a  leisure activity, as an
essential aspect of our educational system, and  as  a  profession,  and
applauds  those who devote themselves to training, often for many years,
developing their skills, honing their talents, and gaining mental acuity
and a well-earned sense of self-esteem; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Tennis Month in the State
of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the observance of National Tennis
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 21,  1881,  the  United  States  Tennis  Association
(USTA),  originally  known  as  the  United  States National Lawn Tennis
Association, was founded in New York City to create rules and  standards
for the emerging game of lawn tennis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The USTA is the not-for-profit, national governing body for
tennis  in  the United States, and leads the promotion and growth of the
sport at every level of play, from beginners to professionals at the  US
Open; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  USTA is the largest tennis organization in the world,
with over 550,000 members from every corner of the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, The USTA proudly partners with  local  tennis  programs  to
showcase  the  important  health,  social,  and  educational benefits of
tennis, and make the sport available to  everyone,  regardless  of  age,
environment,  condition,  or  ability, through its USTA Adaptive grants;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The latest research by the Physical Activity Council  shows
that  more  than  23.6  million  Americans  played  tennis  in  2022, an
unprecedented 33 percent increase in participation  over  2019  and  the
highest number of players since the PAC study began in 2007; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  increasing the accessibility of tennis for New Yorkers
of all ages and ability, the USTA has contributed  to  making  New  York
communities happier and healthier; and
 
  WHEREAS, USTA has declared the month of May as National Tennis Month
to  encourage  players,  organizations,  facilities,  retailers,  tennis
manufacturers and more to promote  local  programs  and  activities,  at
parks  and  facilities  to showcase tennis and spread the word about the
sport and its benefits, and to help players and non-players  alike  find
courts  and  play opportunities in their communities; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Tennis Month
 
in the State of New York, and extend to all those  affiliated  with  the
organization sincere best wishes for the future; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the United States Tennis Association.
