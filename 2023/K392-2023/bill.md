  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as Global Employee
  Health and Fitness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
months which promote healthy living and exercise; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Global
Employee Health  and  Fitness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the observance of National Global Employee Health and
Fitness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Global Employee Health and  Fitness  Month  (GEHFM)  is  an
international  observance  of  health  and fitness in the workplace; the
goal of GEHFM is to promote the  benefits  of  a  healthy  lifestyle  to
employers  and  their  employees  through  worksite  health  promotion
activities and environments; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National  Coalition  for  Promoting  Physical  Activity
hopes  that  one  day  everyone will be physically active, and they will
live, work, and play in environments which facilitate  regular  physical
activity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  CEO  Pledge  for physical activity is the Coalition's
global initiative to encourage every CEO to recognize physical  activity
as an important driver of employee health and business performance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  CEO  Pledge  is  as follows: For the betterment of my
company, our employees, their families, and our community, I  pledge  to
improve  employee  health  and  wellness  by providing opportunities and
resources for physical activity before, during or after the workday, and
to enhance my own health and wellness by engaging  in  regular  physical
activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, As providers of workplace wellness programs, employers have
a  tremendous  opportunity  to  help  their  employees  see the value of
adopting healthier behaviors so they can live healthier  lives;  studies
of  employee  wellness  programs  consistently  find  that  executive
leadership is critical to  employee  engagement;  if  employees  believe
creating  a  culture  of  physical  activity  is  an executive priority,
employees are more likely to be physically active; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many reasons to  sign  the  CEO  Pledge  to  make
physical  activity  a  priority  in  your  workplace:  employees will be
healthier, employees will be happier and more engaged, your organization
will increase productivity, your organization will be better  positioned
to recruit and retain top talent, and your organization will be publicly
recognized as a forward-thinking employer and thought leader; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  Global Employee Health and Fitness Month, CEOs are
encouraged to show support for  workplace  wellness  and  take  the  CEO
 
Pledge for Physical Activity; they can also encourage their organization
to  create  an  active working environment and provide opportunities for
its employees to be active throughout the workday; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is fitting to set aside months which encourage a healthy
lifestyle  for  people of all ages, and, in doing so, enhance the health
and welfare of the entire State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Global
Employee Health and Fitness Month in the State of New York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
