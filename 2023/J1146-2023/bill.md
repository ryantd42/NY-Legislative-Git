  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Sepsis  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023,  as  Sepsis  Awareness
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Sepsis Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sepsis is a life-threatening response to  infection,  which
can  cause  tissue damage, organ failure, and death; severely restricted
blood flow from sepsis can lead to  septic  shock,  requiring  immediate
recognition and intervention to prevent death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  serious health issue occurs when the body's reaction
is atypical, triggering alterations, which can cause significant  damage
to  multiple  organs,  amputations,  and cognitive difficulties; certain
population groups are more vulnerable to developing sepsis, such as  the
young, elderly, individuals with chronic illness, those with compromised
immune systems, and those facing systemic healthcare disparities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  out  of  three  people will develop sepsis over their
lifetime and 1.7 million more are diagnosed with this  health  condition
annually; and
 
  WHEREAS,  350,000 people die each year from sepsis and approximately
50,000 New Yorkers are affected by this condition,  including  New  York
State Senator Jose Peralta who died from sudden septic shock on November
21, 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS,  87  percent  of sepsis occurs at home or in the community,
and every hour of delay in treatment increases the risk of death by four
to eight percent; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Sepsis Month is recognized throughout  the  United
States each September; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative upon all residents of this great Empire
State  that  attention  be  brought  to  this  debilitating  and
life-threatening  health  condition  affecting  so  many of our friends,
family, and neighbors in New York State;  and  further,  in  support  of
sepsis  education, prevention, screening, early treatment and survivors,
and in legacy to lives lost; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2023, as Sepsis
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, Sepsis Alliance, END SEPSIS - The Legacy  of  Rory  Staunton,  The
Home  Care Association of New York State, and IPRO, a New York State and
Federal quality improvement organization.
