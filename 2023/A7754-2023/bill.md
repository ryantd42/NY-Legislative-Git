  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of  section  2-200  of  the  village  law  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  A territory containing a population of at least [five hundred] TWO
 THOUSAND persons who are regular  inhabitants  thereof,  as  hereinafter
 defined,  may  be  incorporated as a village under this chapter provided
 such territory does not include a part of a city or village and  further
 provided the limits of such territory:
  a. do not contain more than five square miles; or
  b.  are coterminous with the entire boundaries of a school, fire, fire
 protection, fire alarm, town special or town improvement district; or
  c. are coterminous with parts of  the  boundaries  of  more  than  one

 ment  district, all of which are wholly contained within such limits and

  a. Petitioners. [Either one or both of the  following  two  groups  of

 town in which all or part of such territory is located SHALL BE REQUIRED
 IN ORDER TO COMMENCE A PROCEEDING FOR THE INCORPORATION OF SUCH TERRITO-
 RY AS A VILLAGE.
  [(2)  The  owners  of more than fifty percent in assessed valuation of
 the real property in such territory assessed  upon  the  last  completed
 assessment roll of the town in which such territory is located. However,
 if  such territory is located in more than one town it shall be required
 in computing such percentage to equalize  the  assessed  valuations  for
 each town; furthermore, in such case, the petition must be signed by the
 owners of more than fifty percent in full valuation of the real property
 in  each part of each town in such territory and computed separately for
 each such part, and assessed upon the last completed assessment rolls of
 the towns in which any part of such territory is located. Full valuation
 shall be determined by applying the  appropriate  equalization  rate  to
 such assessed valuations. If real property in such territory is owned by
 tenants  in  common, joint tenants or tenants by the entirety, each such
 tenant, as a signer of such petition shall, for the  purpose  of  ascer-
 taining the percentage of the assessed valuation upon which the petition
 is based, be considered as the owner of an interest in such real proper-
 ty equal to the result reached by dividing the assessed valuation by the
 number  of owners thereof and shall be credited to that extent with part
 of the total assessed valuation thereof. In the event such real property
 is part of a parcel of land partially situated  within  such  territory,
 the  town  assessor or assessors shall, for the purposes of this section
 make an apportionment of the assessed value of such part as is  in  such
 territory. In such a case, only the apportioned value attributed to such
 part shall be considered.]
  b.  Contents  of  petition.  The  petition shall contain the following
 information:
  (1) An allegation of the basis on which the petition is signed.
  (2) The name of the proposed village.
  (3) An allegation that such territory  contains  a  population  of  at
 least [five hundred] TWO THOUSAND regular inhabitants.
  (4) The manner in which the area requirements of section 2-200 of this
 article are satisfied.
  (5)  A  designation  of  at  least one but no more than three persons,
 giving full names and addresses, on whom  and  at  which  addresses  all
 papers  required  to  be  served  in  connection with the proceeding for
 incorporation, shall be served. A majority of such designees must reside
 in such territory.
  (6) Each page of the petition  and  all  exhibits  and  certifications
 shall be securely fastened together.
  c.  Exhibits  and certifications. Each copy of the petition shall have
 attached thereto prior to the signature pages:
  (1) A  description  of  such  territory  sufficient  to  identify  the
 location  and  extent  of such territory with common certainty and which
 shall be in one of the following forms or a combination thereof:  (a)  a
 metes  and  bounds description; (b) a description made with reference to
 existing streets and navigable waters or a combination of same; or (c) a
 map showing existing streets and navigable waters or  a  combination  of
 same  forming boundaries or metes and bounds or the entire boundaries of
 one or more districts of an entire town.
  (2) A list of the names and address of the regular inhabitants of such
 territory.
  d. [If the petition is alleged to be signed by the owners of more than
 fifty per cent in assessed or full valuation, as the case may be, of the
 A. 7754  3

 real property in such territory, there shall be attached to the petition
 following the signatures of the petitioners an affidavit  or  affidavits
 certifying as follows:
  (1) If such territory is located entirely in one town, a certification
 by  an  assessor  thereof  certifying to the total assessed valuation of
 such territory and the correct total amount thereof owned by the signers
 of the petition, or
  (2) If such territory is located  in  more  than  one  town,  separate
 certifications  by an assessor of each town certifying to the total full
 valuation of that portion of such territory located in such town and the
 correct total amount of full valuation of real property in such territo-
 ry and town owned by the  signers  of  the  petition,  as  specified  in
 subparagraph two of paragraph a of subdivision one of this section.
  e.]  Execution  of petition. (1) The signatures to a petition shall be
 subscribed on a separate page or pages following the exhibits.
  (2) Prefatory statement. Each signature page shall be  prefaced  by  a
 statement  of the basis on which the petition is signed and of the peti-
 tioners' familiarity with the contents and purpose thereof and the boun-
 daries of the territory sought to be incorporated.
  (3) Additional information. Following each signature  there  shall  be
 set  forth, not necessarily by the signer, the signer's address consist-
 ing of street name and number, if any, and town[; and, if  the  petition
 is  based  on  the  ownership of more than fifty per cent in assessed or
 full valuation, as the case may be, of the real property located in such
 territory, the amount of assessed valuation of real  property  owned  by
 the  signer  as  credited  to him in accordance with subparagraph two of
 paragraph a of subdivision one of this section].

 ing thereof which shall be in substantially the following form:
