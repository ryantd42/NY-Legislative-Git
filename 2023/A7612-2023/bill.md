 Introduced by M. of A. NOVAKHOV -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Economic Development
 
 AN  ACT  prohibiting  the public use of cannabis, unless approved by the
  applicable local government
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that cannabis has
 been  legalized  for personal use in New York state. Smoking cannabis in
 public places can be disruptive and harmful to  non-smokers.  Fines  for
 smoking  tobacco in public places have been effective in reducing public
 smoking rates and fines for smoking cannabis in public places  can  help
 enforce  public  health and safety regulations while reducing the burden
 on law enforcement agencies.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, smok-
 ing or using cannabis in any public place, including but not limited  to
 streets,  sidewalks,  parks, and outdoor patios of restaurants and bars,
 shall be prohibited, unless designated for cannabis  use  by  the  local
 government.
  §  3. Any person found to be in violation of the provisions of section
 two of this act shall be subject to a fine of  one  hundred  twenty-five
 dollars,  to  be  paid  to  the  local  government  where  the violation
 occurred, within thirty days of receiving such violation.
  § 4. The cannabis control board, in  conjunction  with  local  govern-
 ments, shall establish regulations and guidelines for the implementation
 and enforcement of this act, including but not limited to the definition
 of a public place and the designation of areas for cannabis use.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
