**Session:** 2023
**Sponsor:** Michael Benedetto
**Status:** In Assembly Committee

## Summary

Establishes a school ventilation and energy efficiency assessment, repair and verification program to require each school to: obtain an HVAC Assessment Report performed by qualified testing personnel documenting the functionality of the existing system or lack thereof, and obtain a report from a mechanical engineer identifying any upgrades, replacements or other measures recommended to improve the functionality, health and safety and/or energy efficiency of the HVAC system; adjust, and, if necessary, repair existing building HVAC systems, and install or replace HVAC systems, if necessary, to ensure proper and efficient operation, as well as compliance with health and safety standards; obtain an HVAC Verification Report performed by qualified testing personnel documenting any upgrades, replacements, installations or any other work performed on the HVAC system functions as designed and/or in compliance with health and safety standards; install CO2 sensors in classrooms, assembly areas, kitchen or cafeteria areas or building office spaces to provide ongoing verification that proper ventilation is maintained during operation; makes related provisions.

 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  BENEDETTO  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing a  school
  ventilation  and energy efficiency assessment, repair and verification
  program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature hereby
 finds and declares that:
  a. The issue of ameliorating a school's air quality has gotten  a  lot
 of  well-deserved  attention during the spread of COVID-19 though venti-
 lation and also with the increase of  extreme  heat  conditions  in  the
 classrooms.  Cleaner  air is better for a school building's population
 and  even  helps  with  higher  thinking/cognitive  abilities.  Although
 schools  are  now  fully  open,  a school with an outdated or inadequate
 heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which controls
 the temperature, humidity, and air quality in school  classrooms,  leave
 many  schools  susceptible to harmful airborne particles and, therefore,
 vulnerable to any current or future contagion that plagues the state. It
 is important for the state to establish a program which provides for the
 safe ventilation and proper filtration of  air  throughout  each  school
 building,  so  they  can operate with the confidence that they have safe
 and efficient HVAC systems in place.
  b. The air ventilation and filtration process, essentially,  seeks  to
 bring outside air into the school building and then both condition (heat
 or  cool)  the  outside  air  and  remove any impure air particles as it
 enters the building (as well as recycling the indoor air).  To  maintain
 safety,  air  particles  entering  a  school must meet minimum standards
 after going through air purifiers/filters (e.g.,  MERV  13  filter)  and
 qualified  testing  personnel and engineers can assess and determine how
 well a filtration system is working and how safe the air is.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 7115  2
 
  c. A program designed to ensure proper school air quality control must
 include professional assessment, repair and/or replacement of  both  the
 HVAC system, as well as carbon dioxide monitors so that any improvements
 to  those  systems  meet  the ventilation rates detailed in the national
 Uniform Mechanical Code. Reports generated from the continual monitoring
 of  carbon dioxide monitors and maintenance of the HVAC system must also
 be made available to the public, electronically.
  d. Approximately 41% of school districts across the United  States  of
 America  need  HVAC  and  carbon dioxide system improvements, repairs or
 updates. Safe air quality levels in public schools protect the health of
 students and staff, significantly reduce the risk of infectious airborne
 diseases, increase attendance and  improve  student  performance.  Funds
 allocated  through  the  U.S.  Department  of Education's Elementary and
 Secondary Schools Emergency Relief (ESSER) Programs and  the  Governor's
 Emergency  Education Relief (GEER) Programs and the Department of Health
 and Humans Services' Head Start and Child Care American Rescue Plan  can
 support improvements to ventilation; repairs, upgrades, and replacements
 in  Heating,  Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems; purchase
 of MERV 13 air filters, portable air purifiers, and upper-room  germici-
 dal  ultraviolet irradiation systems; as well as implementation of other
 public health protocols and CDC guidance.
  § 2. The education law is amended by adding a  new  section  409-n  to
