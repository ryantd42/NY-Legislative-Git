 pursuant  to  paragraph two of this subdivision, one or more blue lights
 or combination blue and red lights or combination blue,  red  and  white
 lights  may  be  affixed  to  a police vehicle, fire vehicle, ambulance,
 emergency  ambulance  service  vehicle,  and  county  emergency  medical
 services  vehicle  provided  that  such  blue  light  or lights shall be
 displayed on a [police  vehicle,]  fire  vehicle,  ambulance,  emergency
 ambulance service vehicle, and county emergency medical services vehicle

 gate  or  interior  of  such vehicles. Such lights may be displayed on a
 police vehicle, fire vehicle,  ambulance,  emergency  ambulance  service
 vehicle,  and  county emergency medical services vehicle when such vehi-
 cles are engaged in an emergency operation. Nothing  contained  in  this
 subparagraph  shall  be  deemed  to  authorize the use of blue lights on
