  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
dedication and commitment of our young people who distinguish themselves
through excellence in musical events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Music  festivals  provide  an  opportunity for students to

long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to

in the piano showcase during  the  2022  New  York  State  School  Music
Association's All-State Festival; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William Floyd High School senior Kellie Tang, one of eight
student-musicians selected as New York State  School  Music  Association
(NYSSMA)  All-State  for the 2021-22 school year, earned the opportunity
to  perform  in  the  piano  showcase  at  the  All-State  festival,  a
prestigious  honor and the first for a William Floyd student in district
history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kellie Tang, who is legally  blind,  was  selected  out  of
nearly  100  applicants  from  across  New  York  State,  and flawlessly

showcase at the Rochester Convention Center's Lilac Ballroom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  her extraordinary musical talent, Kellie

Institute of Music Summer Piano Intensive; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, she received  extremely  high  marks  at  the
National  Piano  Guild  auditions  and  performed in concert at New York
City's famed Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kellie Tang is deserving of this esteemed  recognition  for
her  remarkable  commitment  and  hours  of  practice  in perfecting her
musical abilities; as she takes her leave of high school, she  bequeaths
a legacy of academic and musical achievement to which others may aspire;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Music  study  is  most  worthy  of  being  encouraged  and

skills  to  an  audience,  thereby  giving  them  self-esteem  to last a
lifetime; now, therefore, be it
