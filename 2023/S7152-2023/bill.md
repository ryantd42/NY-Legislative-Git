 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public  health law, in relation to enacting the
  "public university emergency contraception education act"

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings and intent. The legislature finds
 that access to emergency contraception  is  a  basic  measure  that  can
 prevent  college students from having an unwanted pregnancy. The federal
 Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of  emergency  contra-
 ception  as safe and effective in the prevention of pregnancy. Emergency
 contraception has been found to have no effect on an  established  preg-
 nancy.  Medical  research  strongly  indicates that the sooner emergency
 contraception is administered, the better the chance  of  preventing  an
 unwanted  pregnancy.  Therefore, the legislature deems it essential that
 each college and university of the state university of New York and  the
 city  university of New York provide information on emergency contracep-
 tion to its students and makes it available to any student who seeks  it
 whenever  practicable  and in accordance with applicable law and profes-
 sional standards of practice.
  § 2. Short title. This act shall be known and  may  be  cited  as  the
 "public university emergency contraception education act".
  §  3. Subdivision 1 of section 207 of the public health law is amended
 by adding a new paragraph (r) to read as follows:
  (R) A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION COLLEGE EDUCATION  AND  AWARE-
 NESS  PROGRAM.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PARAGRAPH, "EMERGENCY CONTRACEP-
 TION" SHALL MEAN ONE OR MORE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, USED SEPARATELY  OR  IN
 COMBINATION,  IN  A DOSAGE AND MANNER FOR PREVENTING PREGNANCY WHEN USED
 AFTER INTERCOURSE, FOUND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR THAT USE BY  THE  UNITED
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 STATES  FOOD  AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND DISPENSED FOR THAT PURPOSE IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.
  THE  DEPARTMENT SHALL DEVELOP, PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE TO EVERY COLLEGE
 AND UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AND THE CITY  UNIVER-
 SITY  OF  NEW  YORK  INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS AND POSTERS RELATING TO THE
 SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF  EMERGENCY  CONTRACEPTION,  TO  BE  CONSPICUOUSLY
 DISPLAYED AT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS AROUND EACH CAMPUS AND DISTRIBUTED TO
 STUDENTS  IN  A  MANNER TO BE DETERMINED BY EACH COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY.
 THE MATERIALS AND POSTERS SHALL EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF EMERGENCY  CONTRA-
 CEPTION,  INCLUDING  THAT  IT IS DEEMED SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING
 PREGNANCY BY THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,  AND  CANNOT  AND
 DOES NOT CAUSE ABORTIONS.
  IN  IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH THE DEPARTMENT SHALL
 CONSULT WITH REPRESENTATIVES  OF  REPRODUCTIVE  HEALTH  CARE  PROVIDERS,
 STUDENTS AND APPROPRIATE UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it  shall have become a law.  Effective immediately the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
