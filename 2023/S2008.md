 2021 is a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus legislation package passed  by
 Congress  and  signed  into  law  by President Joseph Biden on March 11,
 2021.
  b. Many local small businesses  including  minority-  and  women-owned
 businesses  (MWBEs)  in  our  state  did not receive any federal funding
 under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
  c. As New York state is reopening regionally post  COVID-19,  many  of
 our  MWBEs  who did not receive any PPP funding are in desperate need of
 funding to employ and/or pay staff, purchase inventory, and pay rent and
 utilities.
  § 2. Establishment.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to  the
 contrary, the legislature shall authorize the MWBE development and lend-
 ing program to establish the MWBE protection program to be funded in the
 amount of 100 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
 Funding  for such program may also come from state appropriations. Funds
 received from the American Rescue Plan Act of  2021  shall  be  used  to
 reimburse  any  monies  appropriated  by  the  state  for  the  purposes
 described under section four of this act.
  § 3. Eligibility. Entities  shall  be  eligible  for  MWBE  protection
 program  funds  provided  such  entity  has  less than 100 employees per
 location, was in existence in New York state by the first day the  state
 disaster emergency related to COVID-19 was declared by the governor, can

 the pandemic, and has filed 2018, 2019 or 2020 tax returns.
  §  4.  Grants. The MWBE protection program shall provide the following
 grants in an amount that shall equal 60%  of  the  prior  year  eligible
 expenses not to exceed $100,000.00:
  a.  A  rent  reimbursement  grant to reimburse qualifying entities for
 rent paid during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided such entity  has  docu-
 mentary  proof of such paid rent. This rent reimbursement grant shall be
 capped at 3 months of paid rent during the state of emergencies;
  b. A grant to reimburse qualifying entities for  perishable  inventory
 purchased  before  the  COVID-19  state  of  disaster emergency that was
 thrown out due to the forced shut down of such entity and/or to  replace
 food inventory to help such entity reopen; and
  c. A grant for payroll or for the compensation of independent contrac-
 tors who complete the federal tax form 1099; and
  d. A grant for utilities.
  §  5.  Oversight.  The  state  comptroller  shall  monitor  the  MWBE
 protection program to ensure the provisions of  this  act  are  properly
 executed. The state comptroller shall submit a report on such program to
 the  governor,  the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of
 the assembly, and shall post such on  the  comptroller's  website  on  a
 quarterly basis describing any grants provided under such program.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
