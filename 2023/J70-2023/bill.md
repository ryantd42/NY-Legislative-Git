  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 8, 2023, as Red Cross and Red  Crescent  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of  organizations
that benefit the citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 8, 2023, as Red Cross
and Red Crescent Day in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  the
observance of World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  more  than  70  years,  United  States Presidents and
Governors around the country have recognized the American Red Cross as a
vital humanitarian organization; all New Yorkers are urged  to  continue
to  support  its  work through volunteerism, financial contributions, or
the donation of blood; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the United States, almost five million people require  a
blood  transfusion  each  year;  the  volume of blood donated to the Red
Cross is enough for 21,000 blood transfusions a day; and
 
  WHEREAS, American Red Cross Month celebrates the everyday heroes who
work tirelessly in times of disaster to offer the comfort of  a  helping
hand; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Red Cross, founded in 1881 by Clara Barton and
chartered  by the United States Congress in 1905, is one of our nation's
oldest and most recognized humanitarian organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than a century, the American Red Cross, along with
its generous donors, volunteers and employees, have shared a mission  of
preventing  and  relieving suffering, here at home and around the world,
through  disaster  relief,  support  of  America's  military  families,
life-saving  blood, international services, as well as health and safety
services; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York State, this esteemed  nonprofit  organization's
36 chapters have a long history of providing compassionate care to those
in need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  a  daily basis, this remarkable institution helps make
communities  safer  in  these  uncertain  times  through  its  disaster
preparedness  and  response efforts; its volunteers are always among the
first on the scene providing food, shelter, clothing and friendly  faces
for support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  the  American Red Cross provides nationally
recognized training in  first  aid  and  water  safety,  cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), child care, and HIV/AIDS prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a vital part of its preparedness efforts, the American
Red Cross provides approximately half of the nation's blood  supply  and
the  safest blood products possible to those in need throughout New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Red  Cross continues to provide comfort and
support to our military families and, working with the International Red
Cross, collects and  distributes  funds  to  those  suffering  from  the
effects  of  civil  unrest  and natural disasters around the world; they
have also spearheaded a campaign to immunize  millions  of  children  in
developing countries who do not have access to life saving vaccines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 8, 2023, as Red Cross
and Red Crescent Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
