  §  3. Subdivision 1 of section 903 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 183 of the laws of 2017, is amended to read as follows:
  1. A health certificate shall be furnished  by  each  student  in  the
 public  schools upon his or her entrance in such schools and upon his or
 her entry into the grades prescribed by the commissioner in regulations,
 provided that such regulations shall require such certificates [at least
 twice] ANNUALLY during the elementary grades and [twice in the]  second-
 ary  grades.  An  examination  and  health  history  of any child may be
 required by the local school authorities at any time in their discretion
 to promote the educational interests of  such  child.  Each  certificate
 shall  be  signed  by a duly licensed physician, physician assistant, or
 nurse practitioner, who is authorized by law to practice in this  state,
 and  consistent  with  subdivision  three of section [six thousand nine]
 SIXTY-NINE hundred two of this chapter, or by a duly licensed physician,
 physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, who is authorized  to  prac-
 tice  in  the  jurisdiction in which the examination was given, provided
 that the commissioner has determined that such jurisdiction  has  stand-
 ards  of  licensure  and  practice comparable to those of New York. Each
 such certificate shall describe the condition of the  student  when  the
 examination  was  made, which shall not be more than twelve months prior
 to the commencement of the school  year  in  which  the  examination  is
 required,  and shall state whether such student is in a fit condition of
 health to permit his or her attendance at the public schools. The  exam-
 ination  may  include  a  diabetes  risk analysis. Each such certificate
 shall also state the student's body mass index (BMI) and  weight  status
 category. For purposes of this section, BMI is computed as the weight in
 kilograms  divided  by  the  square of height in meters or the weight in
 pounds divided by the square of height in inches multiplied by a conver-
 sion factor of 703. Weight status categories for  children  and  adoles-
 cents  shall  be  as  defined  by  the commissioner of health. EACH SUCH
 CERTIFICATE SHALL ALSO INCLUDE  AN  EVALUATION  OF  THE  CHILD'S  FAMILY
 HISTORY  WITH  RESPECT  TO  CARDIAC  CONDITIONS  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION SIXTY OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED  FIVE  OF  THIS
 CHAPTER  AND  SUBDIVISION  THIRTY-TWO  OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED SIX OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW. In all school  districts  such  physician,  physician
 assistant  or nurse practitioner shall determine whether a one-time test
 for sickle cell anemia is necessary or desirable and  he  or  she  shall
 conduct such a test and the certificate shall state the results.
  §  4. Subdivision 1 of section 904 of the education law, as amended by
 section 12 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws of 2007,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1.  Each  principal  of a public school, or his or her designee, shall
 report to the director of school  health  services  having  jurisdiction
 over  such  school,  the  names  of  all students who have not furnished
 health certificates as provided in section nine hundred  three  of  this
 article,  or  who  are children with disabilities, as defined by article
 eighty-nine of this chapter, and the director of school health  services
 shall  cause  such  students to be separately and carefully examined and
 tested to ascertain whether any student has defective sight or  hearing,
 or  any  other  physical disability which may tend to prevent him or her
 from receiving the full benefit of school  work,  or  from  requiring  a
 modification  of  such  work  to  prevent  injury to the student or from
 receiving the best educational results.  Each  examination  shall  also
 include  a calculation of the student's body mass index (BMI) and weight
 A. 4159  4
 
 status category. For purposes of this section, BMI is  computed  as  the
 weight  in  kilograms  divided  by the square of height in meters or the
 weight in pounds divided by the square of height in inches multiplied by
 a  conversion  factor  of 703. Weight status categories for children and
 adolescents shall be as defined by the commissioner of  health.  In  all
 school  districts,  such physician, physician assistant or nurse practi-
 tioner shall determine whether a one-time test for sickle cell anemia is
 necessary or desirable and he or she shall conduct such  tests  and  the
 certificate  shall  state the results. If it should be ascertained, upon
 such test or examination, that any of such students have defective sight
 or hearing, or other physical disability, including sickle cell  anemia,
 as  above  described,  the principal or his or her designee shall notify
 the parents of, or other persons in parental relation to, the  child  as
 to  the existence of such disability. If the parents or other persons in
 parental relation are unable  or  unwilling  to  provide  the  necessary
 relief  and  treatment for such students, such fact shall be reported by
 the principal or his or her designee to the director  of  school  health
 services,  whose  duty  it shall be to provide relief for such students.
 Each school and school district chosen as part of an appropriate  sampl-
 ing methodology shall participate in surveys directed by the commission-
 er  of health pursuant to the public health law in relation to students'
 BMI and weight  status  categories  as  determined  by  the  examination
 conducted  pursuant  to this section and which shall be subject to audit
 by the commissioner of health. Such surveys shall contain  the  informa-
 tion  required pursuant to this subdivision in relation to students' BMI
 and weight status categories in aggregate. Parents or other  persons  in
 parental  relation to a student may refuse to have the student's BMI and
 weight status category included in such survey. Each school  and  school
 district  shall provide the commissioner of health with any information,
 records and reports he or she may require for the purpose of such audit.
 The BMI and weight status survey and audit as described in this  section
 shall  be conducted consistent with confidentiality requirements imposed
 by federal law. Data collection for such surveys  shall  commence  on  a
 voluntary  basis  at  the  beginning  of the two thousand seven academic
 school year, and by all schools chosen as part of the sampling methodol-
 ogy at the beginning of the two thousand eight academic school year. The
 department shall also utilize the collected data to develop a report  of
 child  obesity and obesity related diseases. EACH EXAMINATION SHALL ALSO
 INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE CHILD'S  FAMILY  HISTORY  WITH  RESPECT  TO
 CARDIAC  CONDITIONS  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION
 SIXTY OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIVE  OF  THIS  CHAPTER  AND  SUBDIVISION
